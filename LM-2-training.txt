<S> i lent you money , and you returned it ; that s like good neighbors , and we are quits . we are never quits with those who oblige us , was dante s reply ; for when we do not owe them money , we owe them gratitude . what s the use of mentioning that ?: 68.31
<S> he shut himself in his room , and tried to read , but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word , and he threw away the book , and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan , the ladders and the fence .: 42.09
<S> if i only were a a baron , don t you mean ? cried d artagnan , finishing his friend s sentence .: 30.90
<S> during the evening , monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil , accompanied by ali .: 41.33
<S> take this pen and paper , and write what i dictate . i don t know how to write , reverend sir . you lie !: 36.72
<S> let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts ; i am willing , if anyone should suspect this , that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance .: 52.64
<S> nor i , nor i , chorused the sailors .: 58.51
<S> olivain , said athos , showing the servant raoul s shoulder belt , tighten the buckle of the sword , it falls too low .: 59.87
<S> what must come is written . monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening ? quite the contrary , planchet ; the more ill will i have toward monsieur bonacieux , the more punctual i shall be in keeping the appointment made by that letter which makes you so uneasy . then that is monsieur s determination ? undeniably , my friend .: 82.20
<S> you have no enemy here there is no one but fernand , my brother , who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend . and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan , who , as if fascinated by it , came slowly towards edmond , and offered him his hand .: 35.71
<S> ; for if you have discovered nothing , at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions .: 71.83
<S> albert listened with the most profound attention .: 26.43
<S> whilst planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say : well , where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here ? this voice , the sound of which reached d artagnan , reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments , a thousand recollections that he had forgotten .: 51.83
<S> perhaps to madame de longueville .: 29.89
<S> you will then have our swords , with which , i can assure you , my friend and i can play tolerably well .: 33.58
<S> then , seeing that the room was , as usual , empty , and only guarded by the dog , he called to his wife , hello , carconte , said he , the worthy priest has not deceived us ; the diamond is real . an exclamation of joy was heard , and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step .: 36.73
<S> weigh your words before you speak , for my eyes have already become brighter , and my heart beats strongly ; be cautious , or you will make me believe in supernatural agencies .: 96.63
<S> cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission ; but the sentinel , who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general , thought the order did not extend to the young man .: 30.53
<S> well , he said , turning towards his wondering son , when this disguise was completed , well , do you think your police will recognize me now . no , father , stammered villefort ; at least , i hope not . and now , my dear boy , continued noirtier , i rely on your prudence to remove all the things which i leave in your care . oh , rely on me , said villefort .: 34.43
<S> it was the island of tiboulen .: 13.94
<S> did anyone introduce you to him ? no ; it was he who introduced himself to us . when ? last night , after we left you . through what medium ? the very prosaic one of our landlord . he is staying , then , at the ho tel de londres with you ? not only in the same hotel , but on the same floor . what is his name ; for , of course , you know ? the count of monte cristo . that is not a family name ? no , it is the name of the island he has purchased . and he is a count ? a tuscan count . well , we must put up with that , said the countess , who was herself from one of the oldest venetian families .: 30.98
<S> at the end of a quarter of an hour m. d avrigny returned with his associate ; they found the outer gate closed , and not a servant remaining in the house ; villefort himself was obliged to open to them .: 31.99
<S> as he struck the wall , pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off , and fell to the ground in flakes , exposing a large white stone .: 81.42
<S> if so , i will give you a letter of introduction to him . oh , father , i exclaimed , you are very good . but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have reason to repent my recommendation . i extended my hand , and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate , but he stopped me .: 34.99
<S> in spite of this recommendation , which , owing to the noise , could scarcely have been heard , two or three musket shots resounded , succeeded by a terrible discharge .: 33.51
<S> he who was thus looking , without being heard or seen , probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerf s apartments .: 59.05
<S> an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation .: 28.78
<S> i will not , continued he , after a moment s silence , conceal from you , that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged , yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities . at this almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale .: 79.99
<S> sir , said the cardinal , you have heard me ?: 11.87
<S> you may behave politely to the bearer , who is a count and a grandee of spain !: 55.11
<S> come , he said , it is only a veiled lady , some foreign princess , perhaps the mother of cavalcanti .: 50.70
<S> to attain such a point , the blood must be heated to thirty six degrees , the pulse be , at least , at ninety , and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit .: 125.92
<S> and have you any recollection of your country ? when i shut my eyes and think , i seem to see it all again .: 32.10
<S> milady . oh , yes ! said porthos ; true , i had forgotten it ! athos looked at him intently .: 23.52
<S> he went direct to the bedford tavern , and the host , who recognized him , was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising company .: 33.53
<S> all at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand .: 57.05
<S> farther on , a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of st. jean , where state criminals were buried .: 78.79
<S> come , first of all , said athos to d artagnan , my friend , that i may shake hands with you you , our rescuer you , the true hero of us all . athos is right you have my adoration , said aramis , in his turn pressing his hand .: 42.20
<S> what is it ? asked villefort , rushing from his room .: 14.61
<S> the mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament , though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe .: 77.08
<S> at vincennes , tis true , one lives faster my lord , replied la ramee , my lord or dies sooner , for it comes to the same thing . la ramee was going out .: 56.49
<S> then he had a moment s hesitation .: 14.79
<S> when i go back to france i must suggest some such convenient course to cardinal mazarin and the coadjutor .: 87.69
<S> de villefort , the king s attorney ?: 22.99
<S> no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected , and had consequently sent intruders out of the way .: 67.66
<S> everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen ; but both of them had spoken so low that everybody , out of respect , withdrew several steps , so that nobody had heard anything .: 66.25
<S> it is well for albert he is not in the army , said morrel .: 24.01
<S> come , your excellency , the count added , turning to franz , here is luigi vampa , who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed . franz approached , the chief advancing several steps to meet him .: 41.24
<S> edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength ; the flag stone yielded , and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto .: 105.33
<S> twisted his mustache proudly , placing his hand upon his hip .: 50.81
<S> porthos , impatient at his continued losses , kept up a vigorous play with his knee .: 92.72
<S> i have lost even the knife that saved me .: 41.69
<S> i wish my life to be free and open .: 34.05
<S> one morning my father sent for us ; my mother had been crying all the night , and was very wretched ; we found the pasha calm , but paler than usual .: 66.87
<S> gondy raised his hand and demanded silence .: 77.57
<S> well , now that everything is decided , cried porthos , rubbing his hands , suppose we think of dinner !: 39.79
<S> during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt , and secured his trousers round his waist ; his feet were naked , so he had no shoes and stockings to take off ; after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips , and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea , swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound ; he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake .: 41.77
<S> it is not your fault , my good ali , said the count in the arabic language , and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing , either in voice or face it is not your fault .: 42.66
<S> each examined his arms , and put them in order .: 57.05
<S> what ! exclaimed the queen , when the last of them had quitted the apartment , you would yield to these limbs of the law these advocates ? to promote your majesty s welfare , madame , replied mazarin , fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen , there is no sacrifice that i would not make . anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her .: 41.22
<S> you here ? said cha teau renaud , passing his arms through the young captain s ; are you a friend of villefort s ?: 29.43
<S> d artagnan recognized the cardinal .: 15.11
<S> bonacieux , d artagnan turned toward her ; the poor woman reclined where she had been left , half fainting upon an armchair .: 43.68
<S> go , edward , and see . because they are looking for her where she is not to be found . and where are they looking for her ? with grandpapa noirtier . and do you think she is not there ? no , no , no , no , no , she is not there , replied edward , singing his words .: 28.06
<S> during this time porthos played close .: 58.98
<S> fight on all occasions .: 102.87
<S> it is he , said she .: 9.78
<S> stay , since we have finished dinner , i will show it to you , and then we will take coffee in the garden .: 28.48
<S> and as for your poor arm , what difference will that make ?: 122.91
<S> you have lived three years in paris ?: 25.47
<S> i have pursued it for six years only . and previously , where were you ? in the bastile . and before you went to the bastile ? i will tell you , my lord , on the day when you are willing to hear my confession . good !: 31.66
<S> smuggling is a profitable trade , when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed ; as for myself , brought up in the mountains , i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom house officers , as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry , and an inquiry always looks back into the past .: 136.50
<S> is your name bonacieux ? said he .: 23.36
<S> my lord , said athos , we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused , in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill , in so much pain . one must , replied monsieur de bouillon , sacrifice one s comfort to the public good ; but i confess to you i am now almost exhausted .: 62.00
<S> what are my servants ?: 30.64
<S> i wish you to do so , said he .: 9.58
<S> really , m. de blacas , i must change your armorial bearings ; i will give you an eagle with outstretched wings , holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape , and bearing this device tenax . 0133m sire , i listen , said de blacas , biting his nails with impatience .: 78.85
<S> he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment .: 70.90
<S> has the ministry resigned ? no , my dear fellow , returned the young man , seating himself on the divan ; reassure yourself ; we are tottering always , but we never fall , and i begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility , and then the affairs of the peninsula will completely consolidate us . ah , true ; you drive don carlos out of spain . no , no , my dear fellow , do not confound our plans .: 48.72
<S> we are here to guard the gate , and no one whom we do not know shall pass . what is to be done ? said porthos .: 26.24
<S> do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted ? asked the abbe .: 22.08
<S> coquenard , in that tone which says , take my advice , don t touch them . devil take me if i taste one of them ! murmured porthos to himself , and then said aloud , thank you , my cousin , i am no longer hungry . there was silence .: 40.82
<S> to morrow night we shall rescue you . how can that be ? cried the king , whose face was lighted up , in spite of himself , by a flash of joy .: 24.17
<S> grimaud , in a swoon , was tied securely to a horse .: 46.21
<S> life is the greatest treasure , and speaking candidly , ours hangs by a thread . what do you say to this , du vallon ? i , said porthos , i am entirely of d artagnan s opinion ; this is a beastly country , this england . you are quite decided , then , to leave it ? asked athos of d artagnan .: 37.19
<S> god has sent you to me to console , at one and the same time , the man who could not be a father , and the prisoner who could not get free . and faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man , who threw himself upon his neck and wept .: 43.78
<S> ah , monseigneur ! continued bonacieux , throwing himself at his eminence s feet , ah , how truly you are the cardinal , the great cardinal , the man of genius whom all the world reveres ! the cardinal , however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so vulgar a being as bonacieux , did not the less enjoy it for an instant ; then , almost immediately , as if a fresh thought has occurred , a smile played upon his lips , and he said , offering his hand to the mercer , rise , my friend , you are a worthy man . the cardinal has touched me with his hand !: 41.65
<S> at one moment , bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant light , which illumined the sea for the space of a league , they might each be seen , each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing the awe which , even in their hearts of bronze , they could not help experiencing .: 59.95
<S> redistribution is subject to the trademark license , especially commercial redistribution .: 22.74
<S> observe , this is one of her peculiarities , to get rid thus , after one fashion or another , of all the people who bother her .: 65.99
<S> does not your eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating him ? there will be , in all times and in all countries , particularly if religious divisions exist in those countries , fanatics who ask nothing better than to become martyrs .: 150.03
<S> in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord .: 18.81
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> i trust you have brought this rabble to reason . madame , replied the marechal , i have left three men on the pont neuf , four at the halle , six at the corner of the rue de l arbre sec and two at the door of your palace fifteen in all .: 42.83
<S> the count has only been two or three days in paris , but he already knows what a fashionable woman of the marais is , and if he does not , you will show him . ah , monsieur , returned julie , it is treason in my brother to bring you thus , but he never has any regard for his poor sister .: 45.12
<S> yes , sir . he said .: 8.83
<S> he was dressed in a blue frock coat , buttoned up to the chin , and wore at his button hole the rosette of an officer of the legion of honor .: 21.65
<S> at last there was waterloo , and morrel came no more ; he had done all that was in his power , and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly .: 39.34
<S> he decided , then , to tell all .: 30.51
<S> it can not be wondered at that his mind , generally so courageous , but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions , love and fear , was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts .: 75.29
<S> oh , my dear friend , if this be the case , if you can no longer weep , if your frozen heart be dead , if you put all your trust in god , then , maximilian , you are consoled do not complain . count , said morrel , in a firm and at the same time soft voice , listen to me , as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven , though he remains on earth ; i come to die in the arms of a friend .: 33.66
<S> besides , who knows whether , divided , we may not obtain a pardon you from the queen , we from mazarin which , were we all four together , would never be granted .: 83.75
<S> more than two thousand persons had assisted , as at a spectacle , in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friends an undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive .: 142.82
<S> what is the matter ?: 6.15
<S> he begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be possible to him .: 48.86
<S> the countess de winter chapter xxii .: 17.44
<S> m. de morcerf will accompany me . bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travelling carriage would arrive at six o clock .: 54.67
<S> oh , oh ! he at length muttered , do you see ? what ?: 26.45
<S> athos was looking on attentively , when some one touched him softly on the shoulder .: 43.32
<S> a friend , a wife , a daughter , have done us the honor to call us to their aid .: 35.78
<S> attracted by his prepossessing appearance , he renewed his offers of an engagement to dante s ; but dante s , who had his own projects , would not agree for a longer time than three months .: 38.10
<S> and since villefort , the friend of danglars , had acted in this way , no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with , or had lent himself to , any of andrea s intrigues .: 61.60
<S> what next ? asked albert .: 13.48
<S> and this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young d artagnan for so was the don quixote of this second rosinante named from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous appearance that such a steed gave him , good horseman as he was .: 103.42
<S> my dear sir , if a trifle like that could suffice me , i should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account .: 38.74
<S> by the side of andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his defence , and who had been appointed by the court , for andrea disdained to pay any attention to those details , to which he appeared to attach no importance .: 53.39
<S> the other bowed respectfully , and offered his arm to assist the count in descending .: 31.10
<S> they passed into the eating room a large dark room situated opposite the kitchen .: 41.10
<S> d artagnan took possession of his command .: 12.84
<S> not at all , my young man .: 22.81
<S> his excellency did not charge me to purchase this house .: 30.92
<S> i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square , and a depth of two feet .: 43.56
<S> on perceiving monte cristo , she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself , expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love .: 40.63
<S> he approached , paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet , and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat .: 58.37
<S> athos , though now cool and collected , put his hand to his belt , where his loaded pistols yet remained .: 69.20
<S> never ! i could not ! to me , to a brother ? said felton .: 42.90
<S> which i received this morning . d artagnan opened it , and as the day was beginning to decline , he approached the window to read it .: 27.14
<S> and now , my dear girl , said d artagnan , you know that it is not good for any of us to be here .: 14.32
<S> this movement revealed the spot where winter s body had fallen .: 75.44
<S> when crime has been committed , and god , doubtless in anger , turns away his face , it is for the physician to bring the culprit to justice . 40122m have mercy on my child , sir , murmured villefort .: 56.79
<S> all these proofs of an energetic resolution , which albert did not fear on his own account , alarmed him for his mother .: 39.85
<S> whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dante s , instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty .: 84.26
<S> you played very willingly with us without knowing our names , said athos , by the same token that you won our horses . that is true , but we then only risked our pistoles ; this time we risk our blood .: 69.49
<S> review your life , albert ; although it is only just beginning , did a lovely summer s day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career ?: 159.60
<S> who has consoled me in my sorrow but he ?: 104.49
<S> one was the notary s ; the other , that of franz and his friends .: 27.49
<S> yes , a telegraph .: 29.98
<S> he wished once again to press the count s hand , but his own was immovable .: 34.65
<S> follow us , planchet ; we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village . they traversed the width of the village , talking of indifferent things , then as they reached the last houses : go , then , dear friend , said aramis , follow your own career .: 31.17
<S> i will lay a wager that twas that saint christopher , porthos , who performed this feat !: 89.67
<S> here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you , said the sentinel .: 15.62
<S> instead of living the retired baker , you might live as a bankrupt , using his privileges ; that would be very good . but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs ? ah , caderousse , said andrea , how covetous you are !: 52.67
<S> you are dressed ; it is now my turn to dress myself . 20125m teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of san felice s daughter .: 49.43
<S> he might fail , but something must be left to chance .: 60.33
<S> as it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the carnival at rome , especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the piazza del popolo , or the campo vaccino , they wrote to signor pastrini , the proprietor of the ho tel de londres , piazza di spagna , to reserve comfortable apartments for them .: 48.93
<S> major bartolomeo cavalcanti .: 34.67
<S> you sent me a strange madman this morning !: 72.43
<S> at length i felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely , and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insect actors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string . 30191m and are you going there ? i am . what telegraph do you intend visiting ?: 91.99
<S> i was not rich ; my life was in constant danger ; i could not seek them , to my great regret . the president frowned imperceptibly .: 35.73
<S> the second night the door opened ; i was lying on the floor , for my strength began to abandon me .: 27.75
<S> athos rose , walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step , embraced him tenderly , and as he burst into violent sobs , he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice , friend , be a man !: 38.83
<S> this cavalier is my attendant . would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him yours ? demanded the host .: 64.10
<S> but you , my dear athos you , who so generously distributed the englishman s pistoles , which were our legitimate property what do you mean to do ? i am satisfied with having killed that fellow , my boy , seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an englishman ; but if i had pocketed his pistoles , they would have weighed me down like a remorse . go to , my dear athos ; you have truly inconceivable ideas . let it pass .: 72.30
<S> milady was habitually pale ; her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time .: 64.78
<S> he was induced to undertake this journey , of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to andrea either , by the arrival of bertuccio from normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop .: 69.97
<S> in a few minutes laporte came into the room .: 12.05
<S> these notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect , in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal army .: 87.54
<S> in fact , said the cardinal , placing his hand upon a bundle of papers , i have here a whole pile which concerns you .: 21.09
<S> fix your own hour for tomorrow , and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs . at ten o clock then , if you please ; i should like it early , as i am going into the country tomorrow . very well , at ten o clock ; you are still at the ho tel des princes ? yes . the following morning , with the banker s usual punctuality , the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young man s hands , as he was on the point of starting , after having left two hundred francs for caderousse .: 26.20
<S> the ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man .: 204.95
<S> my father and m. danglars served together in spain , my father in the army and m. danglars in the commissariat department .: 44.59
<S> the queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised for in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by laporte .: 42.14
<S> andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion , who smiled complacently , as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle .: 78.95
<S> but wait a minute . anne of austria ran to her jewel case .: 46.25
<S> then i must wait ? asked the young man .: 14.58
<S> having bowed to the two ladies , he extended his hand to debray .: 32.24
<S> she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic .: 41.29
<S> oh , do not deny it !: 16.56
<S> the quick eye of monte cristo however , marked his coming ; and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips .: 54.14
<S> now , on such a day i can neither eat flesh nor see it eaten .: 85.74
<S> i may acknowledge this to a daughter whom i know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference , and not to impute it to me as a crime . this is not to the purpose , said euge nie ; let us speak candidly , sir ; i admire candor . oh , said danglars , i can , when circumstances render it desirable , adopt your system , although it may not be my general practice .: 53.76
<S> these two words greatly amused the men to whom they were addressed .: 42.30
<S> for i am sure the count is his father .: 30.24
<S> my child , my darling edward ; speak to your mother open your dear eyes and look on me once again !: 90.97
<S> by the light of one of these torches d artagnan perceived men in uniform .: 42.27
<S> as for fernand himself , he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned ; unable to rest , he was among the first to quit the table , and , as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds , he continued , in utter silence , to pace the farther end of the salon .: 70.38
<S> the ravisher stopped suddenly , his knees bent under him , and he fell with teresa in his arms .: 43.66
<S> i have only kept this secret so long from you , continued faria , that i might test your character , and then surprise you .: 67.08
<S> firstly , i wish to communicate ; secondly , to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last time .: 73.64
<S> well , then , you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel , and make no attempt to follow this man tonight .: 21.89
<S> either i misunderstand you or you are very shameless ! you only speak thus because you are overheard , coolly replied milady ; and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against me . my jailers and my hangmen !: 91.53
<S> i see it in the depths of the inner cavern .: 26.09
<S> an hour after they stepped into their calash , both dressed in feminine attire .: 78.27
<S> but to return to our subject . well , then , you wish to know if i am of mazarin s party ?: 27.33
<S> every evening he shuts himself in there .: 89.31
<S> count , count ! said he .: 13.01
<S> in an instant d artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter , in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were , up to the present moment absolutely the same , and that consequently he could not undertake , without committing suicide , to kill the comte de wardes .: 49.10
<S> he was going to throw the crawfish out also , when grimaud snatched it from his hands .: 35.38
<S> above this floor was a large atelier , which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitions a pandemonium , in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre eminence .: 104.11
<S> i am a tolerable chemist , and prepare my pills myself . this is a magnificent emerald , and the largest i have ever seen , said cha teau renaud , although my mother has some remarkable family jewels . i had three similar ones , returned monte cristo .: 46.25
<S> his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled .: 67.85
<S> remember , also , villefort , that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty , and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past , as i do and here she extended to him her hand as i now do at your entreaty .: 77.90
<S> i had fixed the embarkation for the twenty fourth ; but i have reflected that the more promptly the affair takes place the more sure it will be .: 90.05
<S> time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses .: 193.66
<S> come , come , said the sailor , i have a better opinion than you of women in general , and of merce de s in particular ; and i am certain that , captain or not , she will remain ever faithful to me . so much the better so much the better , said caderousse .: 28.22
<S> he recognized the influence of merce de s , and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless .: 38.85
<S> the vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor , but jumping into a small skiff , desired to be pulled alongside the pharaon , which he reached as she rounded into la re serve basin .: 92.19
<S> i come to entreat you , sir , continued madame de villefort , as the only one who has the right of doing so , inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction , i come to entreat you to restore , not your love , for that she has always possessed , but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter . there was a doubtful expression in noirtier s eyes ; he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding , and he could not succeed in doing so .: 43.11
<S> the felucca went on , the boat continued stationary , rocked only by the swashing waves .: 83.86
<S> the above mentioned purchase was made on his highness s account , whose mandate i had , for the sum of four hundred thousand francs .: 74.69
<S> listen to me , rather than add to my destruction , rather than add to my ignominy ! if you have merited this shame , madame , if you have incurred this ignominy , you must submit to it as an offering to god . what do you say ?: 45.13
<S> felton , let me die ! well , then , we will live and die together ! cried he , pressing his lips to those of the prisoner .: 21.75
<S> it must , however , be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over kitty was to try and find out what had become of mme .: 57.01
<S> i am endeavoring , he thought , to make this man happy ; i look upon this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil i have wrought .: 76.44
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter , i philosophically closed my eyes ; but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin i will not be the foundation of another man s fortune .: 57.81
<S> franz continued : the president then sought to make him speak more explicitly , but m. de quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him .: 45.27
<S> the fate , replied he , smiling , of those who buried alaric , and were interred with the corpse . yet , had he come , thought dante s , he would have found the treasure , and borgia , he who compared italy to an artichoke , which he could devour leaf by leaf , knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock .: 92.43
<S> i learn all in the silence of my apartments , for instance , i see all the newspapers , every periodical , as well as every new piece of music ; and by thus watching the course of the life of others , i learned what had transpired this morning in the house of peers , and what was to take place this evening ; then i wrote . 40204m then , remarked the president , the count of monte cristo knows nothing of your present proceedings ? he is quite unaware of them , and i have but one fear , which is that he should disapprove of what i have done .: 47.28
<S> not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos ; and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain .: 47.40
<S> my friends will be there , i hope ; that is to say , you are invited , m. danglars , and you , caderousse . and fernand , said caderousse with a chuckle ; fernand , too , is invited ! my wife s brother is my brother , said edmond ; and we , merce de s and i , should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time . fernand opened his mouth to reply , but his voice died on his lips , and he could not utter a word .: 30.46
<S> then i must make a journey to see my family , in the lower part of brittany , to obtain the sum necessary for my departure . porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice .: 71.03
<S> the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do .: 36.79
<S> should anyone else interrogate you , say to him what you have said to me , but do not breathe a word of this letter . i promise . it was villefort who seemed to entreat , and the prisoner who reassured him .: 44.65
<S> proceed , sire , i beg .: 29.11
<S> ah , you frighten me .: 13.29
<S> tis then all settled .: 116.25
<S> may i ask what you were doing there ? my father , who is a merchant , placed me with his correspondent , who in turn sent his son to join our house in london . were you pleased with paris , sir ? yes , but you are much in want of a revolution like our own not against your king , who is a mere child , but against that lazar of an italian , the queen s favorite . ah !: 50.14
<S> who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work ? i tore up several of my shirts , and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed , during my three years imprisonment at fenestrelle ; and when i was removed to the cha teau d if , i managed to bring the ravellings with me , so that i have been able to finish my work here . and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed ? oh , no , for when i had taken out the thread i required , i hemmed the edges over again . with what ? with this needle , said the abbe , as , opening his ragged vestments , he showed dante s a long , sharp fish bone , with a small perforated eye for the thread , a small portion of which still remained in it .: 53.97
<S> ah , good morning , my dear count , said he .: 11.41
<S> by my soul , said aramis , she is charming .: 25.51
<S> besides , although the ballet was danced , the evening had scarcely begun .: 48.56
<S> there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars , for there , before my eyes , beneath my feet , all around me , i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth . after making the tour of the garden a second time , the count re entered his carriage , while bertuccio , who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master s features , took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word .: 41.80
<S> continue to be the good , sweet girl you are at present , and i have great hopes that heaven will reward you by giving you emmanuel for a husband . julie uttered a faint cry , blushed like a rose , and leaned against the baluster .: 63.06
<S> the siege of la rochelle chapter xlii .: 15.89
<S> cavalcanti is going to marry mademoiselle danglars ? asked beauchamp .: 14.42
<S> no , said she , i do not remember it just at this moment ; but if it should occur to me presently , i will tell you . albert was on the point of pronouncing his father s name , when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach ; the young man recollected his promise , and was silent .: 22.56
<S> although my name , or rather that of my brother , would be mixed up with the affair , i will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of you . milady made no reply , but became as pale as a corpse .: 33.93
<S> ah , i recollect , you asked for a place at my window ; you shall have it ; but let us first sit down to table , for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready . as he spoke , a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment , saying : al suo commodo ! the two young men arose and entered the breakfast room .: 42.89
<S> in fifteen or twenty days i shall set out for la rochelle with the army ; but on the eve of my departure a vessel which i shall see depart will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the south .: 46.22
<S> i said all that a man in such a state could say ; but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on , and perfectly harmless . next day next day , sir , you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing , yet you said nothing , though you were present when dante s was arrested . yes , sir , i was there , and very anxious to speak ; but danglars restrained me .: 58.84
<S> what do you want , sir ? asked the driver .: 8.01
<S> adieu , till we meet again !: 65.44
<S> yes , yes , father , tell me where it is , and he opened two or three cupboards .: 25.33
<S> the door was wide open , a hackney coach was standing in the middle of the yard a strange sight before so noble a mansion ; the count looked at it with terror , but without daring to inquire its meaning , he rushed towards his apartment .: 43.83
<S> do you mean is he a good comrade ?: 67.07
<S> on tuesday , all those who through want of money , time , or enthusiasm , have not been to see the carnival before , mingle in the gayety , and contribute to the noise and excitement .: 87.92
<S> you might excite a little curiosity , but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark . i agree with you , monsieur , said the young man , turning pale , and , in spite of himself , trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion , such consequences would be extremely unpleasant . nevertheless , you must not exaggerate the evil , said monte cristo , for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another .: 45.00
<S> at the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping ; their legs began to tremble , and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters .: 39.41
<S> well ? asked the duke when they were alone .: 22.39
<S> they had not seen him for two days .: 17.70
<S> but the kings of modern times , restrained by the limits of mere probability , have neither courage nor desire .: 81.26
<S> occasionally he shuddered ; he thought of the moment when , from the top of that wall , he should protect the descent of his dear valentine , pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand .: 63.19
<S> aha ! what ? blood ! at this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered .: 43.29
<S> he therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the dauphin d or .: 101.36
<S> i could not have killed her by the same blow , i should have fled from my country . dear albert , said beauchamp .: 27.89
<S> aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash .: 90.92
<S> tell the comte de la fere to come to me , said madame de chevreuse , i want to speak to him . and i , said the coadjutor , want it to be thought that i do not speak to him .: 13.59
<S> these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation .: 124.86
<S> i have an inventive mind ; before that is expired some idea will occur to me .: 76.34
<S> d artagnan and planchet mounted , and took the road to st. germain .: 11.77
<S> one of your guards , my prince ; a man of talent and merit , whom you will like , as i and monsieur de chavigny do , i am sure . why does he take my comb ? why do you take my lord s comb ? asked la ramee .: 33.11
<S> you look dull ; are you , after all , unconsciously in love with mademoiselle euge nie ? i am not aware of it , said albert , smiling sorrowfully .: 22.62
<S> my name is ah !: 26.25
<S> when were you here ? i was brought up here . truly ? it is worth something , you see , to have been brought up somewhere . you will wait for me , then ? let me reflect a little !: 38.86
<S> i was arrested and became a prisoner because , under the arbor of la re serve , the day before i was to marry you , a man named danglars wrote this letter , which the fisherman fernand himself posted . monte cristo went to a secretaire , opened a drawer by a spring , from which he took a paper which had lost its original color , and the ink of which had become of a rusty hue this he placed in the hands of merce de s .: 40.58
<S> bring me a carafe of water , said the abbe .: 18.74
<S> do you remember , aramis , that it was here he received that famous bullet wound ? by my faith , twould be excusable in him to tremble , replied aramis , for even i feel a shudder at the recollection ; hold , just above that tree is the little spot where i thought i was killed . it was soon time for grimaud to recall the past .: 80.90
<S> alas , her emotions were wholly personal : she was thinking only of villefort s departure .: 90.25
<S> it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing .: 79.73
<S> these two gentlemen shall decide between us ; but , first , i will state the case to them .: 40.71
<S> now , these reflections had led him further than he intended , and the day was beginning to decline when , by the last ray of the setting sun , he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge .: 49.69
<S> the matter enters completely into the duties of the post . let him be sent for instantly . he is most likely at my ho tel .: 62.44
<S> you have not by chance married a protestant for a third husband , have you ? explain yourself , my lord , replied the prisoner , with majesty ; for though i hear your words , i declare i do not understand them . then you have no religion at all ; i like that best , replied lord de winter , laughing .: 38.53
<S> tell me how , tre ville you know how i delight in accounts of war and fighting . and louis xiii .: 68.72
<S> and me , too ! said porthos .: 13.29
<S> how convenient that there s a bench here .: 96.93
<S> and alexander vi .: 30.76
<S> when this crisis was past , when milady appeared to have resumed her self possession , which she had never lost ; when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently , he said , ah , now !: 59.16
<S> oh , i will be a match for you ! murmured milady , between her teeth ; be assured of that , you poor spoiled monk , you poor converted soldier , who has cut his uniform out of a monk s frock ! by the way , resumed de winter , stopping at the threshold of the door , you must not , milady , let this check take away your appetite .: 49.77
<S> but talking of heat , is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment ? yes ; let me have a bottle of your best wine , and then , with your permission , we will resume our conversation from where we left off . as you please , sir , said caderousse , who , anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession , hastily raised a trap door in the floor of the apartment they were in , which served both as parlor and kitchen .: 50.90
<S> in an instant dante s plan was formed .: 28.07
<S> i wish to see everything . if your majesty wishes to look out well , then , look ! replied d artagnan .: 22.53
<S> there , he said , is our road . the deuce !: 26.86
<S> there is not one of those women , egyptian , turkish , or greek , whom here you call good women , who do not know how , by means of chemistry , to stupefy a doctor , and in psychology to amaze a confessor . really , said madame de villefort , whose eyes sparkled with strange fire at this conversation .: 42.26
<S> he will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity , which he will convert into prosperity .: 149.60
<S> they saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it passed .: 44.07
<S> they were only fit for a young man . i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me , said monte cristo ; but this morning i purchased a very excellent pair of carriage horses , and i do not think they were dear .: 46.96
<S> on the other hand , as the two friends approached to enter , they showed them every kind of civility , thinking them deserters from the royal party and wishing to bind them to their own .: 50.64
<S> they both went into the house ; the drawing room was lighted up they went in there .: 37.73
<S> i hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend ; for you are the only young man to whom i have hitherto spoken as i have done to you . tre ville said to himself : if the cardinal has set this young fox upon me , he will certainly not have failed he , who knows how bitterly i execrate him to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at him .: 55.18
<S> in the meantime , grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master , with the musketoon on his shoulder , and his head shaking .: 27.77
<S> by an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given , d artagnan put his horse into a gallop , and in a few strides overtook the carriage ; but the window was hermetically closed , the vision had disappeared .: 35.79
<S> the truth was , it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m. danglars and his architect , who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day .: 71.09
<S> interested man ! cried she , smiling .: 68.15
<S> the first feeling that pervaded paris on hearing of the flight to saint germain , was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves alone .: 83.49
<S> what do you mean by that ?: 11.25
<S> ah , i have come now to what is most difficult . speak , speak !: 34.17
<S> m. coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things .: 80.74
<S> i have proposed to you to marry , not for your sake , for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor , and will now be satisfied , i hope ; but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible , on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into . euge nie became uneasy .: 42.00
<S> but , monsieur louvieres , are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me ? you have been preparing long enough , my lord , for it to be welcome to you now . never mind , said the coadjutor ; you must be well aware that this requires reflection . and how many hours of reflection do you ask ? twelve hours , sir ; is it too long ? it is now noon ; at midnight i will be at your house . if i should not be in , wait for me . good !: 39.71
<S> that milady s son has left england , that he is in france , on his road to paris , if he be not here already . the devil he is ! said porthos .: 31.04
<S> intact , my dear friend ; besides the harness of your bucephalus and mine . but what is the use of harnesses without horses ? i have an idea about them . athos , you make me shudder . listen to me .: 38.32
<S> a thousand pardons , gentlemen ; but no doubt this man brings me the news i expected . and rising also , he went off at a quick pace .: 50.60
<S> he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat , and he redoubled his exertions , increasing rapidly his distance from the cha teau , but exhausting his strength .: 85.60
<S> i have warned m. danglars of it till i am tired , but he is fascinated with his luccanese .: 42.41
<S> if an individual project gutenberg electronic work is derived from texts not protected by u.s. copyright law does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder , the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees or charges .: 12.65
<S> hereafter , being able to ask for me at all hours , and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities , you will probably obtain that which you desire . that is to say , replied d artagnan , that you will wait until i have proved myself worthy of it .: 28.50
<S> i wish to thank them all at once .: 25.18
<S> it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life .: 32.07
<S> the bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain .: 33.30
<S> however , promise me one thing . what is it ? promise me , i say . i will do anything you desire , except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is .: 49.35
<S> milady appeared to have entirely recovered .: 51.25
<S> yes , said she , it is madame danglars and her daughter , who have come to call on us .: 17.56
<S> he turned toward the wounded man , who had watched with intense anxiety all the various expressions of his countenance , and holding out his arm to him , said , come , i will not abandon you thus .: 23.22
<S> we do what we can ! and she rushed out of the room .: 19.00
<S> now , said he , the sacrifice is consummated !: 18.85
<S> aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds , which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls .: 33.68
<S> at verberie , raoul desired olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding them ; he had been observed to pass only three quarters of an hour previously , but he was well mounted , as the tavern keeper had already said , and rode at a rapid pace .: 50.02
<S> it is with valets as with wives , they must be placed at once upon the footing in which you wish them to remain .: 78.17
<S> felton darted into the palace .: 27.10
<S> he believed , having triumphed over me in my sleep , that all was completed .: 89.33
<S> have you not seen m. de saint me ran , madame de saint me ran , barrois , all fall ?: 16.80
<S> ah , there you are , my good d arminges ; i have given you a great fright , have i not ?: 29.32
<S> morrel looked around uneasily .: 48.08
<S> i was so situated as to hear and see everything , he answered .: 43.67
<S> oh , said morrel , i know not , indeed , if i may reveal this secret to mortal ears , but fatality impels me , necessity constrains me , count morrel hesitated .: 60.78
<S> the guide held the door open .: 37.09
<S> stop ! said the englishman , i have the key of that door ; and he opened the door , with a trembling hand , into the second compartment , where mousqueton and blaisois were preparing supper .: 28.25
<S> let monsieur grimaud go in , monsieur mouston . i could go in as well as grimaud , said mousqueton , a little piqued .: 45.39
<S> should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the abbe busoni , send for me , if i am still on earth , and i will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity . bertuccio bowed respectfully , and turned away , sighing heavily .: 91.44
<S> number 34 and number 27 dante s passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense .: 285.99
<S> now i repeat , my father is named m. de villefort , and i am ready to prove it . there was an energy , a conviction , and a sincerity in the manner of the young man , which silenced the tumult .: 25.77
<S> sire , it is something more opaque than the fog . indeed ! said winter , it appears to me like a bar of red color . it is the enemy , who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us ! exclaimed athos .: 42.46
<S> i receive him among the number of my friends .: 34.35
<S> these were the ancestors of charles , standing back dimly in their tarnished frames .: 118.87
<S> well , then , how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information ? you think , resumed mazarin , that rochefort he was cardinal richelieu s creature , my lord .: 41.41
<S> the felucca is waiting for us , you know ; let us leave to night , we have nothing more to do here . you are in a hurry , sir count , said d artagnan .: 21.54
<S> your d artagnan .: 89.58
<S> tell me , continued winter , always possessed by the same idea , is there not a tradition in france that henry iv. , the evening before the day he was assassinated , when he was playing at chess with m. de bassompiere , saw clots of blood upon the chessboard ? yes , said athos , and the marechal has often told me so himself . then it was so , murmured winter , and the next day henry iv .: 52.35
<S> d artagnan examined her with a rapid glance .: 15.18
<S> but after his bath ? asked morcerf .: 50.37
<S> colonel , colonel , cried mordaunt , you are betrayed .: 38.19
<S> it could no longer be doubted ; the family name was fully given .: 47.71
<S> if the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem .: 56.20
<S> take my arm , and let us go . d artagnan offered his arm to mme .: 12.81
<S> these young fellows can none of them drink , said athos , looking at him with pity , and yet this is one of the best ! chapter xxviii .: 43.49
<S> from whom ? asked the gascon .: 15.73
<S> oh , my friends , said d artagnan , you come once more to save my life , not only mine but that of these gentlemen .: 25.01
<S> you wish to make me believe something too dreadful .: 39.21
<S> queens are the weakest of their sex , when it comes to such things as these . and m. de beaufort is he still in prison ? yes .: 55.73
<S> the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall , and contained upwards of two thousand volumes ; one division was entirely devoted to novels , and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding .: 59.76
<S> very well , cried d artagnan , at last , furious , very well , since you wish it , let us leave our bones in this beggarly land , where it is always cold , where fine weather is a fog , fog is rain , and rain a deluge ; where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese ; in truth , whether we die here or elsewhere matters little , since we must die . only reflect , my good fellow , said athos , it is but dying rather sooner . pooh !: 63.54
<S> i have but one promise and but one heart to give ; that promise is pledged to you , that heart is also yours .: 85.43
<S> of course we do , replied albert .: 28.32
<S> but proceed , i beg of you .: 15.93
<S> who will support them ? a shudder ran through the young man s frame .: 32.61
<S> i heard it from m. debray , who was present at the explanation . valentine also knew the truth , but she did not answer .: 31.83
<S> is monsieur your cousin ?: 48.14
<S> then , in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs , whither had come so many courtiers , the scene of so much flattering homage , alone with a despairing servant , whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own , the king at last yielded to sorrow , and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness , those shadows , and that wintry cold .: 96.56
<S> he shouted again .: 38.68
<S> presently they heard milady retire to her room .: 83.96
<S> what !: 14.83
<S> fernand , you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of god !: 54.12
<S> years of suffering , in my opinion , count double , and i have suffered for twenty years . ah , yes , i understand , said mazarin ; want of fortune , perhaps .: 35.40
<S> as we have said , he perfectly understood the old man s vocabulary , and if he did not use it more often , it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing .: 43.84
<S> i do not know , for i have never had it , madame . have you any friends ? i had three , two of whom have left paris , to go i know not where .: 33.96
<S> down with mazarin ! that s nothing new ; no , we ve been used to those acclamations for some time . and you sing chorus , replied guitant , laughing .: 87.40
<S> the famous secretaire is in the dressing room . is there a window in the dressing room ? two , one here and one there . andrea sketched two windows in the room , which formed an angle on the plan , and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom .: 64.14
<S> you told me , my dear valentine , that you were engaged to m. d e pinay , and that your father was resolved upon completing the match , and that from his will there was no appeal , as m. de villefort was never known to change a determination once formed .: 34.76
<S> monsieur the comte de la fere , whose family is allied to the montmorency and the rohan , is easily the equal of monsieur de mazarin . no matter , said d artagnan , in his most wheedling tone .: 22.05
<S> nobody but ourselves , replied caderousse ; the fact is , we do not lodge travellers indeed , our tavern is so near the town , that nobody would think of stopping here . then i am afraid i shall very much inconvenience you . inconvenience us ?: 95.82
<S> after breakfast , the abbess came to pay her a visit .: 43.44
<S> to meddle in politics , he exclaimed , in a languid voice , leaning back in his easy chair .: 35.12
<S> in that case , gentlemen , said the footman , on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope , in that case it is another thing , and i think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment .: 32.04
<S> adieu , madame , replied the king s attorney , as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door .: 22.69
<S> he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening .: 59.50
<S> the three friends ordered breakfast , and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed .: 31.78
<S> everyone must live . certainly ; go on . i loved my brother tenderly , as i told your excellency , and i resolved not to send the money , but to take it to him myself .: 39.26
<S> by day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel ; at night , in addition to complines and matins , they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells .: 60.35
<S> at that moment patrick entered the room , crying , a letter from france , my lord . from france ! cried buckingham , forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came .: 58.27
<S> will that do ? my dear athos , said aramis , you speak like nestor , who was , as everyone knows , the wisest among the greeks . well , then , said athos , it is agreed .: 29.40
<S> no , emmanuel , i am but a man , and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious . and pressing his lips on the hand of julie , who rushed into his arms , he extended his other hand to emmanuel ; then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness , he made a sign to maximilian , who followed him passively , with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him .: 43.28
<S> this drunken caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence . drunk , if you like ; so much the worse for those who fear wine , for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts ; and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time : tous les me chants sont buveurs d eau ; c est bien prouve par le de luge . 1 you said , sir , you would like to help me , but yes ; but i added , to help you it would be sufficient that dante s did not marry her you love ; and the marriage may easily be thwarted , methinks , and yet dante s need not die . death alone can separate them , remarked fernand .: 106.14
<S> the young man pressed valentine s hand to his lips , and then left the house by a back staircase .: 17.94
<S> and what have i to do with your ill humor ? said the baroness , irritated at the impassibility of her husband ; do these things concern me ?: 22.85
<S> besides , we are men ; and everything considered , it is our lot to risk our lives ; but she , asked he , in an undertone .: 41.10
<S> on reaching the palace , d artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay .: 22.64
<S> you are ambitious it is natural ; you are a man of genius and you know your worth .: 49.52
<S> the count de guiche was awakened at five o clock in the morning by raoul , who came to wish him good day .: 25.95
<S> the prisoner himself is named edmond dante s , mate on board the three master the pharaon , trading in cotton with alexandria and smyrna , and belonging to morrel son , of marseilles . before he entered the merchant service , had he ever served in the marines ? oh , no , monsieur , he is very young . how old ? nineteen or twenty at the most . at this moment , and as villefort had arrived at the corner of the rue des conseils , a man , who seemed to have been waiting for him , approached ; it was m. morrel .: 41.92
<S> then the count knelt down by the side of the bed , which death had converted into an altar .: 35.43
<S> aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that d artagnan and porthos might enter .: 37.08
<S> bonacieux , shrugging her shoulders .: 19.77
<S> did you observe that man s eyes while he was speaking to us ? no . but have you ever watched him carefully ? doubtless he is capricious , but that is all ; one thing alone struck me , of all the exquisite things he placed before us , he touched nothing .: 60.49
<S> i must not be cast down by the discovery that i have been deceived .: 31.58
<S> alas , my dear mother , some have suffered so much , and yet live , and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made them on the fragments of all the hope which god had given them !: 40.18
<S> you know about it . was i not your second ? cried d artagnan .: 21.21
<S> then , with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged , and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture , he approached anne of austria , from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage .: 57.28
<S> d artagnan put the gold in his hat , and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with porthos , each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen louis .: 44.87
<S> as on the evening before , the soldier stopped his march to listen to her .: 38.81
<S> yes , my lord , said the young man , with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein .: 18.28
<S> it was then that he told me two cavaliers of the parisian army were seeking me and named the comte de la fere . what !: 37.41
<S> but i am grateful , i swear to you . but what does this note contain ? milady will tell you . ah , you do not love me ! cried kitty , and i am very wretched . to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women .: 43.53
<S> others besides you have undergone such , monsieur athos , and have replied thereto . thus i have told your eminence that you had but to question us , and we are ready to reply . what was that letter you were about to read , monsieur aramis , and which you so promptly concealed ? a woman s letter , monseigneur . ah , yes , i see , said the cardinal ; we must be discreet with this sort of letters ; but nevertheless , we may show them to a confessor , and you know i have taken orders . monseigneur , said athos , with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply , the letter is a woman s letter , but it is neither signed marion de lorme , nor madame d aiguillon . the cardinal became as pale as death ; lightning darted from his eyes .: 54.19
<S> a similar signal replied to him ; and five minutes after , a boat appeared , rowed by four men .: 51.89
<S> he kept on his way at the same rate , heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road .: 58.84
<S> he would take advantage of the first moment of surprise , shame , and terror , to triumph over her .: 41.73
<S> it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency , to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto , since all trace of him seemed entirely lost ; or of my sister , since she was dead . and in what light did you view the occurrence ? inquired monte cristo .: 57.08
<S> i have arrived from cadiz this morning .: 52.95
<S> do you remember me ? said he to the host , who advanced to greet him .: 14.70
<S> stir but a step , said they , and you are a dead man . why should you threaten me with death , cried i , when i have already declared my innocence ? tush , tush , cried the men ; keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at ni mes .: 53.42
<S> be easy , monsieur , said planchet ; you do not know me yet .: 15.94
<S> where is the key you speak of ? here it is . ah , my lord !: 15.12
<S> laporte , give the light to monsieur the chevalier de coislin . the queen touched with her lips the white , smooth brow the royal child presented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette .: 75.51
<S> you are certainly treating your cousin very handsomely ! the poor fowl was thin , and covered with one of those thick , bristly skins through which the teeth can not penetrate with all their efforts .: 72.92
<S> well , then , only fulfil your promise of rescuing peppino , and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion , but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another . have a care how far you pledge yourself , my good friend , for i may remind you of your promise at some , perhaps , not very distant period , when i , in my turn , may require your aid and influence . let that day come sooner or later , your excellency will find me what i have found you in this my heavy trouble ; and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing , you may regard it as done , for done it shall be , on the word and faith of hush ! interrupted the stranger ; i hear a noise . tis some travellers , who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight . twere better we should not be seen together ; those guides are nothing but spies , and might possibly recognize you ; and , however i may be honored by your friendship , my worthy friend , if once the extent of our intimacy were known , i am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby . well , then , if you obtain the reprieve ? the middle window at the cafe rospoli will be hung with white damask , bearing a red cross . and if you fail ? then all three windows will have yellow draperies . and then ? and then , my good fellow , use your daggers in any way you please , and i further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess . we understand each other perfectly , then .: 93.55
<S> no , returned monte cristo i only guessed .: 24.62
<S> you know that you are , madame , said villefort , whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance .: 26.38
<S> about half a mile from this , on the same road , there is an inn , and about a mile further on , after leaving the inn , you will reach the village of greney .: 63.66
<S> he saw nothing , he had no knife or sharp instrument , the window grating was of iron , but he had too often assured himself of its solidity .: 73.74
<S> besides , the eyes of the gascons have , as it is asserted , like those of cats , the faculty of seeing in the dark .: 46.48
<S> here was the officer d artagnan was seeking .: 30.81
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> he then seemed more easy .: 47.68
<S> he will not desert , monsieur the cardinal , be assured of that ; i will answer for him . no , he will not desert , said the king ; he can always be found , as tre ville says .: 24.90
<S> our wine ! said athos , astonished .: 24.30
<S> the son of marie michon !: 23.06
<S> but on my soul , it looks so .: 60.05
<S> yes , doctor . is this the same lemonade of which you partook ? i believe so . what did it taste like ? it had a bitter taste . the doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand , put his lips to it , and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine , he spat the liquor into the fireplace .: 53.60
<S> monsieur , my majordomo , will there be a pie ? i should think so , indeed almost as high as a tower . you told him it was for me ? yes , and he said he would do his best to please your highness . good ! exclaimed the duke , rubbing his hands .: 33.53
<S> the affair at armentieres ? asked he again .: 45.26
<S> but as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out , all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded simultaneously .: 110.76
<S> i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle , which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely .: 46.25
<S> i bitterly reproach myself , i assure you . well , what does it signify , valentine , so long as i am satisfied , and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society , or two words from your lips ?: 55.75
<S> i really don t know what hotel it is ; all i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there nonsense ! exclaimed guitant , with a burst of laughter ; those men must be poets . come , guitant , speak , if you please , respectfully of these gentlemen , said mazarin ; don t you know that i was in my youth a poet ?: 50.44
<S> he did not even know i existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united .: 49.99
<S> as d artagnan had no time to lose , on account of the audience of the king , which was fixed for midday , he cast his eyes around , and seeing that the street was empty , said to his adversary , my faith !: 24.73
<S> i am suffering i can not see .: 29.02
<S> we set out last evening and here we are . here you are . his eminence had something to communicate to her majesty , something secret and private a mission that could be confided only to a sure man and so has sent me to saint germain .: 70.53
<S> i will not detain you , monsieur , continued the countess ; i would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate . my dear count , said albert , i will endeavor to return your politeness at rome , and place my coupe at your disposal until your own be ready . a thousand thanks for your kindness , viscount , returned the count of monte cristo but i suppose that m. bertuccio has suitably employed the four hours and a half i have given him , and that i shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door . albert was used to the count s manner of proceeding ; he knew that , like nero , he was in search of the impossible , and nothing astonished him , but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the count s orders had been executed , he accompanied him to the door of the house .: 32.47
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> he knew all objection would be useless , and instantly determined how to act .: 54.92
<S> pardieu , gentlemen , said he .: 13.55
<S> but , contrary to all expectation , when the 31st of august came , the house opened as usual , and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter , examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny , and , from first to last , paid all with the usual precision .: 75.01
<S> oh , monsieur chevalier , do you love that woman still ? no , no ; it is one of my friends who loves her monsieur athos , this gentleman here . i ? cried athos , with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an adder .: 29.83
<S> i will assist your memory , madame , continued the count ; the day had been burning hot ; you were waiting for horses , which were delayed in consequence of the festival .: 43.94
<S> thanks , madame ! said porthos , but i don t like to abuse your kindness ; besides , i must think of my outfit ! that s true , said the procurator s wife , groaning , that unfortunate outfit ! alas , yes , said porthos , it is so . but of what , then , does the equipment of your company consist , monsieur porthos ? oh , of many things ! said porthos .: 27.67
<S> that person is here , madame , said the officer , leaving the entrance open , and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect .: 24.36
<S> tis more than possible , answered the comte de la fere .: 16.68
<S> that is lucky , said blaisois .: 15.48
<S> show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court , and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux . the waiter had no suspicions ; andrea spoke with perfect composure , he had a cigar in his mouth , and his hands in the pocket of his top coat ; his clothes were fashionably made , his chin smooth , his boots irreproachable ; he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late , that was all .: 63.21
<S> it seems to me , however , said mazarin , the safest method . yes , for you , my lord , but not for the queen ; you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking . nevertheless or find some one else , continued d artagnan , turning his back .: 31.14
<S> ah ! he said , it is sad , i know well , to be forced to yield thus ; but , pshaw !: 30.12
<S> and he is very rich . i am not so sure of that . and yet you said he had money . fifty thousand livres a mere trifle . he is well educated . hem , said monte cristo in his turn .: 34.73
<S> sleep as soundly as you can tonight , and tomorrow , if you can , we will take our departure together . till tomorrow , then , said aramis ; for iron nerved as you are , you must need repose . the next morning , when d artagnan entered aramis s chamber , he found him at the window .: 37.52
<S> come , then , come , then ! cried milady , trying to drag the young woman along by the arm .: 15.19
<S> he had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise ; every one , therefore , believed him to be dead , especially those to whom his death would give promotion .: 49.75
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> suddenly , he felt an arm thrown around his body , and a well known voice behind him exclaimed , father dear father ! the old man uttered a cry , and turned round ; then , seeing his son , he fell into his arms , pale and trembling .: 30.90
<S> i am in the hands of my enemies , continued she , with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the puritans .: 24.33
<S> bravo ! he said ; besides , we shall be there at the time of the flight .: 14.62
<S> yes , my pocket has a hole in it . oh , yes , monsieur raoul ! said mousqueton , the letter was very consoling .: 31.37
<S> i like a favorable reception ; it expands the countenance , and those around me do not then appear so ugly .: 89.49
<S> athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will .: 56.62
<S> while waiting his assistance i trust to your word ; you have said that my son should live , have you not ? yes , madame , he shall live , said monte cristo , surprised that without more emotion merce de s had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her .: 47.17
<S> to love you cry , fie !: 67.65
<S> i feel , if this continues , said mme .: 35.63
<S> why is he not here that i may tell him so ? sir , replied monte cristo coldly , i did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs .: 25.59
<S> it is impossible , said the procureur .: 7.53
<S> is that all you want ? yes . valentine rang the bell , and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m. noirtier s room .: 21.51
<S> the curtain was drawn , and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open , and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man .: 41.13
<S> constance , constance ! cried d artagnan .: 20.24
<S> the name of father is sacred in two senses ; he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey .: 60.64
<S> explain , my child , he said , explain , my child , he said , explain where did you find this purse ? in a house in the alle es de meilhan , no .: 30.19
<S> he felt convinced of his identity , but he did not venture to address him . an englishman , said monte cristo , who grew uneasy at the attention with which julie looked at him .: 32.77
<S> made tre ville the captain of his musketeers , who were to louis xiii .: 44.99
<S> monsieur porthos !: 19.03
<S> the moccoletto is like life : man has found but one means of transmitting it , and that one comes from god .: 87.13
<S> now , said valentine , motioning to morrel to sit down near her grandfather , while she took her seat on his footstool , now let us talk about our own affairs .: 29.38
<S> by kitty s chamber he could gain that of her mistress .: 51.86
<S> now , as i dislike him , and hope his railway , his electric telegraph , or his search for baths , will ruin him , i am watching for his discomfiture , which must soon take place . what was the cause of your quarrel ? when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends . why do you not seek revenge ? i have already fought three duels with him , said the englishman , the first with the pistol , the second with the sword , and the third with the sabre . and what was the result of those duels ? the first time , he broke my arm ; the second , he wounded me in the breast ; and the third time , made this large wound . the englishman turned down his shirt collar , and showed a scar , whose redness proved it to be a recent one .: 49.86
<S> but d artagnan , still keeping on the defensive , drew near to kitty s door .: 20.96
<S> look , added he .: 25.19
<S> woe to you , m. de villefort , if you do not strike first ! this is what i would say had she only killed two persons but she has seen three deaths , has contemplated three murdered persons , has knelt by three corpses !: 70.90
<S> poverty overtook you .: 199.54
<S> a little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream , ready to embark .: 31.22
<S> what do you want , m. bertuccio ? said he .: 7.06
<S> she passed her finger slowly down the columns , and when she came to the word will , m. noirtier s eye bade her stop .: 62.42
<S> he perceived cha teau renaud and debray , who had just gained the good graces of a sergeant at arms , and who had persuaded the latter to let them stand before , instead of behind him , as they ought to have done .: 34.79
<S> when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the ante chamber .: 23.84
<S> yes , in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious minded companion would have taken weeks to effect .: 71.94
<S> as he was about to pass , the wind blew out porthos s long cloak , and d artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it .: 26.15
<S> when he saw his employer , the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed , drew on one side into the corner of the landing place , passed his quid from one cheek to the other , stared stupidly with his great eyes , and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return .: 72.68
<S> do you know , my dear villefort , cried the comte de salvieux , that is exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries , when questioned by his majesty s principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de conde ; and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles .: 43.59
<S> who would ever have thought it ? d artagnan only sighed .: 37.11
<S> the two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the right hand crypt belonging to the saint me ran family .: 79.80
<S> in the name of heaven , my lord ! cried mme .: 7.81
<S> yes , continued athos , four times only ; once at the house of monsieur cre quy ; another time at my own house in the country , in my cha teau at when i had a cha teau ; a third time at monsieur de tre ville s where it surprised us all ; and the fourth time at a cabaret , where it fell to my lot , and where i lost a hundred louis and a supper on it . then monsieur takes his horse back again , said the englishman .: 59.37
<S> the young officer , however , remained mute and motionless ; his look alone had spoken .: 26.43
<S> all at once the noise of a door , turning on its hinges , made me start .: 31.60
<S> i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the pharaon , and look carefully to the unloading of her freight .: 47.51
<S> milady , however , saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much , and kept at it ; only she now let her conversation drift toward the cardinal .: 68.62
<S> there he found madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening , but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good burgundy .: 68.70
<S> five months after he had been separated from his son , and almost at the hour of his arrest , he breathed his last in merce de s arms .: 38.42
<S> i think , on the contrary , that it is a charming night , replied the countess , and those who are here will complain of but one thing , that of its too rapid flight . i am not speaking , said the duke with a smile , of the persons who are here ; the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you , and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely ; i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome . ah , asked the countess , who is out in the streets of rome at this hour , unless it be to go to a ball ? our friend , albert de morcerf , countess , whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o clock this evening , said franz , and whom i have not seen since . and don t you know where he is ? not at all . is he armed ? he is in masquerade . you should not have allowed him to go , said the duke to franz ; you , who know rome better than he does . you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi , who gained the prize in the race today , replied franz ; and then moreover , what could happen to him ? who can tell ?: 49.72
<S> you like m. maximilian morrel , do you not , grandpapa ? asked valentine .: 17.84
<S> comte de wardes not a word about the sapphire .: 55.46
<S> if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous , there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew .: 76.88
<S> yes , my lord , my mother , replied the young man , advancing into the room until he was face to face with lord de winter , and crossing his arms .: 20.59
<S> the writing of madame de chevreuse ! said milady to herself .: 20.38
<S> de wardes ; i know it , cried d artagnan .: 13.95
<S> anne of austria opened the door to him herself .: 17.30
<S> it is humiliating , said he , thus to receive money given grudgingly , an uncertain supply which may soon fail .: 102.74
<S> d artagnan therefore followed mme .: 27.83
<S> i went on first , fortunately .: 33.90
<S> he took them with him , without encouraging them or promising them anything , and without concealing from them that their luck , and even his own , depended upon the cast of the dice .: 73.02
<S> be assured , gentlemen , we shall do you honor in our dying .: 33.26
<S> do you expect news from him ? i expect himself . himself ?: 70.87
<S> i heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted charles was killed , said cromwell , staring very fixedly at mordaunt .: 61.66
<S> valentine we may easily conceive where morrel s appointment was .: 145.93
<S> had i been as great a friend of jonah as i am of d artagnan i should have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself ; and you would have done the same , aramis . certainly but you make me out better than i am , dear count .: 48.36
<S> it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker .: 64.97
<S> they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired .: 38.94
<S> wait . what are you going to do ? asked aramis .: 9.80
<S> i saw you were unhappy , and your unhappiness interested me ; that s all ; but since you believe i act for my own account , adieu , my dear friend , get out of the affair as best you may ; and danglars rose as if he meant to depart .: 44.15
<S> well , i vow i felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said , why do you ask me that ? and looked so strangely at me . then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels ? faith , yes , almost , said raoul .: 60.85
<S> i hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated .: 70.83
<S> let me fight like a woman , then ; my strength is in my weakness . then , as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance , so mobile and so expressive , she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger , which convulsed her features , to that of the most sweet , most affectionate , and most seducing smile .: 74.52
<S> you guess aright , my friend ; this youth is an orphan , deserted by his mother , who left him in the house of a poor country priest .: 44.35
<S> peppino at the same time that the steamer disappeared behind cape morgiou , a man travelling post on the road from florence to rome had just passed the little town of aquapendente .: 67.37
<S> imprudent , thrice imprudent ! no , monsieur , be satisfied ; nobody saw her , replied d artagnan , and he related to m. de tre ville how the affair came to pass .: 46.02
<S> m. de tre ville , who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection , never ceased recommending him to the king .: 36.40
<S> he escapes us . so much the better , muttered athos .: 24.03
<S> the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands .: 10.63
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> and now that you have obtained what you want , go , said she , monsieur de gondy . whenever her majesty has need of me , replied the coadjutor , bowing , her majesty knows i am at her command . ah , cursed priest ! cried anne , when he had retired , stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door , one day i will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me to day . mazarin wished to approach her .: 46.79
<S> what are you doing here ? he asked in a lofty tone , as that of one accustomed to command .: 28.16
<S> he saw the deputation from the parisians enter it ; they were coming to assign the definitive place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen .: 60.95
<S> i have no greater regard for the bastille than you .: 39.63
<S> but lord de winter might suspect him ; felton himself might now be watched !: 80.07
<S> i should have been pleased to see her , for i like her very much . and i hate her , said cha teau renaud .: 14.11
<S> do you take me for half a woman ?: 29.86
<S> take something . mme .: 62.66
<S> believe me , madame , i had entirely forgotten it . but it is not so easy to forget , monsieur , that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend , madame de villefort , which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me . 30101m this time , at least , i do not deserve your thanks .: 41.06
<S> in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand .: 31.71
<S> did you not see that at that name the young man stopped ? more reason , then , when he spoke to you , for sending him about his business . a quarrel ? asked athos .: 35.57
<S> standing on the prow was a tall man , of a dark complexion , who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone , which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan .: 35.49
<S> no door gave entrance to the room .: 65.68
<S> the past chapter 114 .: 25.89
<S> you believe , and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the world with his heresies and debaucheries to that infamous sardanapalus whom the blind call the duke of buckingham , and whom believers name antichrist ! i deliver you up to buckingham ?: 120.98
<S> but we have not as yet declared war ; perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions , therefore a solemn conference is indispensable . for my own part , i demand it , said aramis .: 58.78
<S> it was like having a spy in the enemy s camp .: 37.23
<S> i could drink four more such bottles ; they are no bigger than cologne flasks .: 144.70
<S> now , said tre ville , lowering his voice , and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone , now let us talk about yourself , my young friend ; for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king , the triumph of the queen , and the humiliation of his eminence .: 24.09
<S> i did not even draw my sword , but i took him who offended me round the body , and threw him out of the window .: 30.16
<S> the lackeys followed their masters , and the chamber was left solitary , with its broken window , its open door , and its smoky lamp burning sadly on the table .: 57.66
<S> d artagnan trembled .: 10.57
<S> it is my marriage you mean , is it not , dear grandpapa ? yes , yes , yes , signed the paralytic , casting on valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning .: 33.09
<S> come , ease me of my anxiety , or else frighten me at once . lucien , a great event has happened ! said the lady , glancing inquiringly at lucien , m .: 66.15
<S> returned home with athos , aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview ; but d artagnan confined himself to telling them that m. de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign , and that he had refused .: 40.53
<S> all gazed at him searchingly .: 79.63
<S> he wants to be sure that i go away , said d artagnan to himself .: 15.08
<S> courage ! cried raoul , courage ! too late ! murmured the young man , too late ! the water closed above his head and stifled his voice .: 36.90
<S> if you do , you know that my hand stretches far , and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from me . no signature .: 60.52
<S> the apartment of m. bonacieux , then , became a mousetrap ; and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal s people .: 54.13
<S> read the address . monsieur el comte de wardes . the remembrance of the scene at st. germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous gascon .: 47.98
<S> the first thing that met his eye was the meridian , drawn by the abbe on the wall , by which he calculated the time ; then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died .: 41.70
<S> did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces it ? no , madame , no ; the scaffold awaits the poisoner , whoever she may be , unless , as i just said , the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison . madame de villefort uttered a wild cry , and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features .: 56.51
<S> on arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door : madame , he said , i hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders , when you learn that the gentlemen i have come to announce are the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay . on hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy , which the two gentlemen heard .: 22.93
<S> i left five hundred with assunta , my sister in law , and with the other five hundred i set off for ni mes .: 36.14
<S> monte cristo smiled .: 10.44
<S> when are you to be married ? i will tell you all , said valentine ; from you i have nothing to conceal .: 21.76
<S> more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking , the only tools for which had been a chisel , a knife , and a wooden lever ; faria still continuing to instruct dante s by conversing with him , sometimes in one language , sometimes in another ; at others , relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory .: 71.88
<S> porthos s chamber is , you say , on the first story , number one ? yes , monsieur , the handsomest in the inn a chamber that i could have let ten times over . bah !: 67.93
<S> and yet it is very hard , added she , that a man upon whose affection i thought i might depend , treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies . that is because your fancies go too far , replied the triumphant bonacieux , and i mistrust them . well , i will give it up , then , said the young woman , sighing .: 46.15
<S> why , said she , you could plant one of the chestnut trees in the tuileries inside !: 57.61
<S> because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute ; whereas the stranger , on the contrary , in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his back .: 54.83
<S> barrois , his features convulsed , his eyes suffused with blood , and his head thrown back , was lying at full length , beating the floor with his hands , while his legs had become so stiff , that they looked as if they would break rather than bend .: 58.67
<S> bonacieux was standing at the door , and looked at d artagnan hatefully .: 16.85
<S> i vow i should consider it a profanation . pledge it , then ; you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on it .: 61.07
<S> you have water woods flowers there ? she sighed again and leaned her charming head , gracefully reclined , on her hand , still beautiful in form and color .: 148.08
<S> i saw , amid the shadows , the table sink through the floor ; a quarter of an hour later it reappeared , bearing my supper .: 48.11
<S> the king has nothing like it . no , answered porthos , i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal , monsieur de mazarin .: 35.57
<S> he is walking about and thinking , thought d artagnan ; but of what ?: 42.45
<S> ah heavens , if it were that !: 54.18
<S> she was struck , no doubt , with a superstitious idea ; she conceived that heaven denied its aid , and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen , her head drooping and her hands clasped .: 41.57
<S> the chief took the paper , unfolded it , and , raising his hand , heaven be praised , and his holiness also , said he in a loud voice ; here is a pardon for one of the prisoners ! a pardon ! cried the people with one voice ; a pardon ! at this cry andrea raised his head .: 29.92
<S> the valet re entered .: 19.59
<S> then , casting a glance on the handsome young man , who was scarcely twenty five years of age , and whom he was leaving in his gore , deprived of sense and perhaps dead , he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist .: 39.88
<S> arrived at this last hue , it changed no more .: 104.00
<S> don t be afraid , said he , smiling .: 8.47
<S> her cap was embroidered with pearls , the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds , her girdle was of turkey silk , with large embroidered flowers , her bodice and skirt were of cashmere , her apron of indian muslin , and the buttons of her corset were of jewels .: 45.03
<S> nevertheless , to d artagnan s great astonishment , the pretty kitty defended herself resolutely .: 70.49
<S> his wife , on the contrary , whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle , was pale , meagre , and sickly looking .: 49.75
<S> there are only a dozen men at the most . that would be nothing for us four ; it is too much for us two .: 30.73
<S> great people only thank you for doing the impossible ; what s possible , they say , they can effect themselves , and they are right .: 96.19
<S> go , then , my friends , said the former , sighing .: 15.24
<S> she had raised her veil , and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son .: 40.97
<S> they made him enter this carriage , the officer placed himself by his side , the door was locked , and they were left in a rolling prison .: 31.91
<S> d avrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead , and the abbe promised to devote his prayers to valentine and his attentions to noirtier .: 41.10
<S> we need not add that the goldsmith , o reilly , and his assistant , were prohibited from going out under any pretext .: 67.46
<S> no , no , be easy on that score .: 13.45
<S> have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path ? never , answered de guiche .: 44.56
<S> we have been in this place nearly eighty three hours . hem ! muttered porthos , with a kind of pretense of answering .: 30.10
<S> in an instant his sword glittered in his hand , and he sprang upon his adversary , whom , thanks to his great youthfulness , he hoped to intimidate .: 24.60
<S> he opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish .: 49.75
<S> he is here , and here , said she , touching her eyes and her heart .: 19.18
<S> scarcely had it reached them , ere the boy , though still pale as marble , opened his eyes , and eagerly gazed around him .: 34.71
<S> yes , monseigneur , but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things ; and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue !: 54.61
<S> two windows only of the pavilion faced the street ; three other windows looked into the court , and two at the back into the garden .: 63.22
<S> bicarat and porthos had just made counterhits .: 85.23
<S> but listen !: 33.03
<S> we shall meet again , master d artagnan , continued the leader , raising his voice .: 16.69
<S> the next two days passed in much the same way .: 36.23
<S> and the troop continued their route .: 27.74
<S> reflect : promise to be silent , and riches , consideration , even honor , shall surround you ; threaten to speak , and i will condemn you to infamy . you ? cried i .: 91.54
<S> come , sir , he said , lend me twenty francs ; you will soon be paid ; you run no risks with me .: 33.11
<S> just think .: 199.99
<S> toward two o clock in the morning somebody endeavored to open the door ; but as planchet awoke in an instant and cried , who goes there ? somebody replied that he was mistaken , and went away .: 36.10
<S> he commanded with it ; it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed .: 67.43
<S> d artagnan had not failed in his career , but circumstances had been adverse to him .: 26.11
<S> sir , he said , you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime . say absurd , since it has become useless .: 42.41
<S> well , monsieur , i am at your service . if what you say be true , replied the count , smiling , perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family ? certainly , i will do so , said the young man , with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention .: 21.39
<S> i have an infernal spirit .: 34.10
<S> now then , what do you say to that ? alas !: 14.95
<S> suddenly an idea flashed across his mind .: 72.13
<S> the marshal raised his hand in token of assent .: 13.75
<S> of course , we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old ; and it was of this man that i intended to ask shelter . what was his name ? inquired the count , who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccio s story .: 37.86
<S> teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her , and pressed closely against her guide , not uttering a syllable ; but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance , she endeavored to repress her emotion .: 65.58
<S> everything was as athos had foreseen .: 57.15
<S> scratches himself ? inquired the duke , what does your majesty mean ? yes , indeed , my dear duke .: 28.71
<S> juxon consented the more readily to take him with him , as he would require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to communicate .: 84.12
<S> almost before the key had turned in the lock , and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse , dante s , whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him , hurried back to the abbe s chamber , and raising the stone by pressing his head against it , was soon beside the sick man s couch .: 62.70
<S> only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel . well , perhaps .: 67.32
<S> try to stand upright , and let the lovers make love without interruption .: 89.24
<S> at last the heavy machine , which was called a chariot in those days , came out , rumbling against the gates , and de winter , still on horseback , bent again to the door to converse with her majesty .: 51.88
<S> i can not answer for the queen .: 14.21
<S> but , sir , once more i beg pardon ; perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here . and he glanced timidly at the count s blue coat .: 54.06
<S> that reply led to several questions about the king s capture , and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely .: 168.43
<S> the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states .: 25.52
<S> as to porthos , all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table .: 40.09
<S> the prisoner followed his guide , who led him into a room almost under ground , whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears ; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly , and showed dante s the features of his conductor , an under jailer , ill clothed , and of sullen appearance .: 105.47
<S> i have been looking for him , but without success . he will be here tonight . in what part of the house ? in the baroness s box , i believe . that charming young woman with her is her daughter ? yes . i congratulate you . morcerf smiled .: 32.24
<S> in addition to this , d artagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart : endure nothing from anyone but the king , the cardinal , and monsieur de tre ville . he flew , then , rather than walked , toward the convent of the carmes de chausse s , or rather deschaux , as it was called at that period , a sort of building without a window , surrounded by barren fields an accessory to the preaux clercs , and which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had no time to lose .: 52.04
<S> on the evening of the day after the arrest of poor bonacieux , as athos had just left d artagnan to report at m. de tre ville s , as nine o clock had just struck , and as planchet , who had not yet made the bed , was beginning his task , a knocking was heard at the street door .: 25.15
<S> is it possible that rochefort has become a better man than i am ? he said to himself .: 22.03
<S> you can not guess , said he , what there is in that small vase , can you ? no , i really can not . well , then , that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter . but , replied franz , this ambrosia , no doubt , in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name ; in vulgar phrase , what may you term this composition , for which , to tell the truth , i do not feel any particular desire ? ah , thus it is that our material origin is revealed , cried sinbad ; we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing , without regarding it , or if we do see and regard it , yet without recognizing it .: 85.77
<S> a little before they came to fromelles the storm burst .: 112.62
<S> i wish to consult you about some thing . do so . do you think it is time for us to enter the service ? but are you not still in the service you , d artagnan ? i mean active service .: 37.75
<S> all the bodily fatigue of the day , all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on , disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep , when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber .: 53.18
<S> at least , delay the trial till the next assizes ; we shall then have six months before us . no , madame , said villefort ; instructions have been given .: 47.04
<S> what time is it , then ? eh !: 21.08
<S> everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder .: 84.92
<S> we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips .: 24.39
<S> you are deceived , monsieur ; i know her very well . ah , said mme .: 16.90
<S> the duchess was the first to speak .: 17.00
<S> tell them this , athos , resumed d artagnan ; thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the lord . athos repeated d artagnan s words .: 97.99
<S> signed abbe busoni . it is the same . what do you mean ? said the major .: 20.15
<S> her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death .: 41.35
<S> what ! cried porthos , are we all going away , then ?: 22.24
<S> the boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung over the water at that moment .: 56.87
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> i think him capable of everything . well , with the five minutes grace , we have only ten left . i will profit by them to tell you something about my guest . i beg pardon , interrupted beauchamp ; are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us ? yes , and for a most curious one . go on , then , for i see i shall not get to the chamber this morning , and i must make up for it . i was at rome during the last carnival . we know that , said beauchamp .: 41.24
<S> you were at the festival of your marriage ? said the deputy , shuddering in spite of himself .: 24.53
<S> madame , replied valentine , he has not even breakfasted .: 24.45
<S> are you then pressed for this money ? yes ; for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow . tomorrow ?: 55.54
<S> but at the very moment when d artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it , m. de tre ville was highly astonished to see his prote ge make a sudden spring , become crimson with passion , and rush from the cabinet crying , s blood , he shall not escape me this time ! and who ? asked m. de tre ville .: 41.94
<S> in the first place he himself furbished a sword , which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath ; he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt .: 61.27
<S> and why were you alone ? 40231m because you had been arrested , edmond , and were a prisoner . and why was i arrested ?: 44.89
<S> no . my faith , said d artagnan .: 10.72
<S> here are some lozenges which i have made up on purpose ; they are compounded doubly strong . monte cristo opened the tortoise shell box , which the lady presented to him , and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition .: 72.64
<S> upon my word , child ! exclaimed the angry marquise , your folly exceeds all bounds .: 39.28
<S> if you wish to see me the king s attorney , you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician . at this moment , and as though the utterance of villefort s wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment , a servant entered the room , and whispered a few words in his ear .: 37.60
<S> my dear , said villefort , in answer to his wife , you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family , nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod .: 40.40
<S> a benefit reproached is an offense committed . the devil ! said d artagnan , you are insupportable .: 39.82
<S> this is one of those attempts that happen every day . are you sure that we are not its objects ? we ?: 50.13
<S> d artagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern , put his head in at the half opened door , and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed : good , he said .: 40.97
<S> no , monsieur , it is not aramis ; and by your exclamation i perceive you have mistaken me for another , and pardon you . you pardon me ? cried d artagnan .: 26.07
<S> but it seems to me , said monte cristo , and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say , that if m. noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested , he can not have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward . true , said madame de villefort , with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe ; is it not unjust shamefully unjust ?: 27.59
<S> once thus ensnared , unless the protecting hand of god snatch him thence , all is over , and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction .: 125.64
<S> baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance .: 39.95
<S> but , doctor , you see me already so grieved how can i introduce into my house so much scandal , after so much sorrow ?: 65.29
<S> this second attack was much more violent than the first , and he had slipped from the couch to the ground , where he was writhing in agony .: 27.17
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> nevertheless , bonacieux manifested real joy , and advanced toward his wife with open arms .: 74.88
<S> be so good as to show us the way and we will follow you . mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses .: 49.89
<S> at the moment when the hand of the massive time piece , representing endymion asleep , pointed to nine on its golden face , and the hammer , the faithful type of mechanical thought , struck nine times , the name of the count of monte cristo resounded in its turn , and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door .: 60.12
<S> well , you , said porthos , what then ? i can not wait . oh !: 20.42
<S> what is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously .: 158.06
<S> the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing ; at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door , convinced they were about to liberate him , but the sound died away , and dante s sank again into his seat .: 36.90
<S> the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .: 46.63
<S> twice you have pronounced that word ! certainly .: 122.27
<S> a small white cloud , which had attracted dante s attention , crowned the summit of the bastion of the cha teau d if .: 28.26
<S> in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls . you are very happy , exclaimed athos , laughing , in spite of himself , at the sally of the irresistible gascon ; for you see the bright side of everything . what would you have ? said d artagnan .: 38.07
<S> what have you done with monsieur de bruy ?: 15.03
<S> bonacieux , and that he should find her next day at the louvre ; sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another , who , in a jealous fit , had surprised her and carried her off .: 45.25
<S> how inscrutable are the ways of providence for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated , and raise up him who was so abased ? dante s whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others .: 153.15
<S> no !: 15.96
<S> at the hour appointed , lord de winter and the four friends repaired to the convent ; the bells tolled , the chapel was open , the grating of the choir was closed .: 28.52
<S> d artagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without dying .: 78.18
<S> and a little bit of a thief . oh , sir !: 42.52
<S> i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear . monsieur does me wrong , said planchet ; i thought he had seen me at work . yes , but i thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first time . monsieur shall see that upon occasion i have some left ; only i beg monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long . do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening ? i hope so , monsieur . well , then , i count on you . at the appointed hour i shall be ready ; only i believed that monsieur had but one horse in the guard stables . perhaps there is but one at this moment ; but by this evening there will be four . it appears that our journey was a remounting journey , then ? exactly so , said d artagnan ; and nodding to planchet , he went out .: 62.23
<S> the bell summoned him to his seat , and he entered the orchestra with cha teau renaud and beauchamp .: 23.25
<S> porthos looked at d artagnan , quite amazed at the resources with which his companion s gascon sharpness continually supplied him .: 63.36
<S> yet he did not return home .: 18.21
<S> i will be an abbe if it suits me .: 32.03
<S> athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice , then the tall man made a sign to the musketeer that he might come in .: 20.84
<S> why did he kill himself instead of you ?: 41.32
<S> i will go down . then he descended , a smile on his lips , and murmuring that last word of human philosophy , perhaps ! but instead of the darkness , and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find , dante s saw a dim and bluish light , which , as well as the air , entered , not merely by the aperture he had just formed , but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without , and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks , and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks .: 51.02
<S> julie , emmanuel , and some of the servants , ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of maximilian .: 60.92
<S> what say you to that ? i say that she was my mother . she caused the unfortunate duke of buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was , ere that , honest , good and pure .: 50.18
<S> the usher returned and made a sign to d artagnan to follow him .: 11.62
<S> andrea cavalcanti , or rather m. benedetto , is nothing more nor less than an assassin ! sir , i do not deny the justice of your correction , but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man , the more deeply will you strike our family .: 63.99
<S> it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight , for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury .: 61.23
<S> you put back the boards , sweep the floor , go out at the door , and run as i told you . oh , monsieur !: 27.52
<S> is she your daughter ? no , mademoiselle , said monte cristo , astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question .: 25.91
<S> the steps were crowded with masks , who strove to snatch each other s torches .: 47.65
<S> m. de tre ville was not at his ho tel .: 7.04
<S> they reached the rue st. honore , and in the place du palais cardinal they found the twelve invited musketeers , walking about in expectation of their comrades .: 53.48
<S> the confusion of his mind , the terror which spurred him on , the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him , and the hooting of the people who , notwithstanding the early hour , were going to their work , only made him precipitate his course .: 52.30
<S> the joy of the king was lively .: 23.22
<S> thanks , d artagnan , thanks ! cried aramis , almost in a state of delirium .: 16.15
<S> the boat moved off toward the left hand shore of the lys , bearing the guilty woman and the executioner ; all the others remained on the right hand bank , where they fell on their knees .: 69.09
<S> bonacieux , which had reminded him of that which he had dragged from under the feet of aramis .: 48.01
<S> luckily the man i had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak , so i took advantage of his silence to walk off . have you seen d artagnan ? we got separated in the crowd and i could not find him again . oh ! said athos , satirically , i saw him .: 50.80
<S> the hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when i shall think myself sinking into the abyss .: 101.96
<S> and by what gate did they go out ? by the saint maur gate . if you are deceiving me , rascal , you will be hanged to morrow . and if you catch up with them you won t come back to hang me , murmured the sergeant .: 54.08
<S> the commissary , who had till this time held his head down over his papers , looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with .: 43.34
<S> let us go immediately . they sent for a cabriolet .: 27.21
<S> so much the better for me , sir , if you speak to me , as you say , with frankness for then you will do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions ; but if you have entertained any doubt , as naturally you may , i feel that i am ruining myself by speaking the truth .: 32.44
<S> i was tutor to his nephews , who are dead ; and when he was alone in the world , i tried by absolute devotion to his will , to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness .: 40.06
<S> however , when morrel went down to his dinner , he appeared very calm .: 33.22
<S> how was it that a presentiment did not warn merce de s that her lover was within three hundred yards of her ?: 39.91
<S> edmond felt that the moment had arrived , summoned up all his courage , held his breath , and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins .: 35.68
<S> oh , the devil !: 11.33
<S> the sergeant had not the courage to reply ; he showed him the open door , the empty room .: 30.64
<S> beauchamp , my good fellow , you know i am starving , said debray : do not set him off on some long story . well , i do not prevent your sitting down to table , replied beauchamp , cha teau renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast . gentlemen , said morcerf , it is only a quarter past ten , and i expect someone else . ah , true , a diplomatist ! observed debray .: 38.11
<S> yes , replied the old man .: 5.16
<S> i will not abandon buckingham thus .: 53.93
<S> once only had villefort seen his father ; it was the day after that upon which bertuccio had paid his second visit to benedetto , when the latter was to learn his father s name .: 46.49
<S> beyond that hedge , that garden , and that cottage , a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity where paris slept a vast void from which glittered a few luminous points , the funeral stars of that hell !: 145.81
<S> adieu , my lord , murmured my mother , determining quietly to await the approach of death .: 40.41
<S> if a repast were on foot , athos presided over it better than any other , placing every guest exactly in the rank which his ancestors had earned for him or that he had made for himself .: 107.06
<S> is it you , indeed ?: 15.10
<S> there is nothing more easy , said mousqueton , with a modest air .: 15.64
<S> suddenly the door opened , an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered , followed by two guards , to whom the king waved an imperious gesture .: 51.66
<S> whither art thou going , grimaud ? to join the vicomte de bragelonne in flanders , your honor . they were taking the road toward paris , when groans , which seemed to proceed from a ditch , attracted their attention .: 60.52
<S> the fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds ; but at length d artagnan dropped his sword , which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick .: 43.63
<S> the young man sprang to the entrance , darted through it , carefully drawing the stone over the opening , and hurried to his cell .: 29.12
<S> charles shuddered .: 49.64
<S> if you are outside the united states , check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading , copying , displaying , performing , distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg work .: 14.66
<S> he married a woman who keeps a confectioner s shop in the rue des lombards , for he s a lad who was always fond of sweetmeats ; he s now a citizen of paris .: 48.81
<S> yes , replied morcerf , but that will plunge my mother into positive grief . then do not marry her , said the count .: 48.84
<S> by the lord , my good host !: 61.47
<S> on perceiving the count he rose quickly .: 24.76
<S> we are not come here , sir , to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness , or false professions of friendship , said albert , but to demand an explanation . the young man s trembling voice was scarcely audible .: 45.38
<S> the queen , as he went on , looked at him with increasing astonishment .: 10.82
<S> danglars thought for ten minutes about his wife in paris ; another ten minutes about his daughter travelling with mademoiselle d armilly ; the same period was given to his creditors , and the manner in which he intended spending their money ; and then , having no subject left for contemplation , he shut his eyes , and fell asleep .: 54.20
<S> d artagnan entered after the cardinal , and behind d artagnan the door was guarded .: 26.21
<S> there is a wise latin proverb that is very much in point . cedant arma tog , said villefort with a bow .: 80.78
<S> villefort looked at valentine as they said this .: 47.09
<S> good heavens !: 14.43
<S> but i , as you see , am nailed to my bed ah !: 38.27
<S> and she went out , but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult emmanuel .: 26.94
<S> project gutenberg is a registered trademark .: 9.94
<S> i had been told , but would not credit it , that the grecian slave i have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of ali pasha . it is true , nevertheless . then , said morrel , i understand it all , and this scene was premeditated . how so ? yes .: 37.28
<S> but still , if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars , said the count , you must allow that he has a fine name ? so he has ; but i like mine as well . certainly ; your name is popular , and does honor to the title they have adorned it with ; but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice , too firmly rooted to be exterminated , a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years . and for this very reason , said danglars with a smile , which he tried to make sardonic , i prefer m. andrea cavalcanti to m. albert de morcerf . still , i should not think the morcerfs would yield to the cavalcanti ? the morcerfs ! stay , my dear count , said danglars ; you are a man of the world , are you not ? i think so . and you understand heraldry ? a little . well , look at my coat of arms , it is worth more than morcerf s. why so ? because , though i am not a baron by birth , my real name is , at least , danglars . well , what then ? while his name is not morcerf . how ? not morcerf ? not the least in the world . go on . i have been made a baron , so that i actually am one ; he made himself a count , so that he is not one at all . impossible ! listen my dear count ; m. de morcerf has been my friend , or rather my acquaintance , during the last thirty years .: 46.80
<S> at sight of the mustaches and the naked sword , the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a man .: 46.09
<S> they explained what had occurred that evening .: 59.17
<S> if i were a man , that would barely be possible ; but what can a woman do ?: 45.61
<S> i am the viscount de bragelonne and he is called grimaud . at this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk from the other , the latter dismounting from his mule and desiring that it should be taken to the stables without being unharnessed .: 31.58
<S> he dreaded not so much the revelation , for he could reply to or deny its truth ; he cared little for that mene , mene , tekel upharsin , which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall ; but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them .: 85.51
<S> let us consider first the ancient rights .: 77.92
<S> there was one lying on the table ; he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient , who , in the midst of his convulsions , was making vain attempts to vomit ; but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them .: 36.08
<S> listen attentively . alas , stammered villefort , i do not lose a single word . m .: 26.85
<S> do you think you can behead me with a single blow ? asked the king .: 15.83
<S> come , come , do not look so astonished , or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature . dante s pressed the gendarme s hand as though he would crush it .: 45.19
<S> it is to throw ourselves into the wolf s jaws , said aramis .: 23.07
<S> we have had orders , answered the man , to help you in taking care of your prisoners . there could be no fault to find with this arrangement ; on the contrary , it seemed to be a delicate attention , to be gratefully received ; d artagnan , therefore , thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to general cromwell s health .: 51.08
<S> the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously , whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man , whose worn , hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past .: 77.72
<S> does the cardinal refuse to receive the king ?: 40.48
<S> one minute that knife , one minute , a single minute , and i will restore it to you through the grating of the door .: 36.80
<S> i have dreamed that the unlucky englishman was dead .: 38.65
<S> you , aramis , know anne of austria better than i do .: 36.17
<S> but what s that to us ?: 28.19
<S> informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the king s countenance , m. de tre ville felt himself something like samson before the philistines .: 46.60
<S> on rising , he went to his window , which opened on a terrace , having the sea in front , and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest .: 41.81
<S> are they paid ? yes , to night . let them be off and return to their own country , there to hide their shame , if its hills are high enough ; i have nothing more to do with them nor they with me .: 58.56
<S> i see them about twenty paces behind my lord .: 31.26
<S> an excellent idea .: 45.77
<S> d artagnan , meantime , pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression .: 42.41
<S> oh , yes , replied the count ; understand me , i would fight a duel for a trifle , for an insult , for a blow ; and the more so that , thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises , and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired , i should be almost certain to kill my man .: 47.47
<S> oh ! he murmured , as he left the threshold of the palace : ungrateful court !: 38.44
<S> de winter remembered the monster that milady had been ; he rose , dignified and calm , restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man .: 35.55
<S> he made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes .: 30.40
<S> the count , however , has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest , with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time , will bring them back to as fine , that is as terrifying , a condition as they were in yesterday .: 66.73
<S> the sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on the lowest step ; and just below this lamp there was laid , wrapped in a flowing mantle of violet velvet , worked with fleurs de lis of gold , a catafalque resting on trestles of oak .: 80.59
<S> monsieur de tre ville is ill , so my company can t do without me ; there !: 59.54
<S> he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme .: 34.38
<S> i shall want you this evening , he said return in two hours . my lord , said d artagnan , i have an appointment in two hours which i can not miss . do not be uneasy , said mazarin ; it is the same . good ! thought d artagnan ; i fancied it was so . return , then , at five o clock and bring that worthy monsieur du vallon with you .: 25.83
<S> but stop !: 52.37
<S> he would have spoken , but his voice failed him .: 16.29
<S> are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain ?: 60.52
<S> and what brought you here ? i came to thank god for my happy deliverance , said rochefort .: 48.84
<S> then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven , as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath .: 45.42
<S> oh , their heads are soon cut off , said danglars .: 31.13
<S> d artagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said , shaking his head : see , dear friend , what it is to belong to the army .: 26.36
<S> they were waiting at the entrance of the rue sainte catharine , and their horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade .: 22.14
<S> he had just expired , with clenched hands , his mouth in a spasm of agony , and his hair on end in the sweat of death .: 33.44
<S> well , come ; set to . ah , sir , you are going to save my life a second time ! cried planchet .: 28.06
<S> the judge we remember that the abbe busoni remained alone with noirtier in the chamber of death , and that the old man and the priest were the sole guardians of the young girl s body .: 40.68
<S> just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road .: 151.72
<S> i left it when i was but five years old , replied hayde e .: 21.78
<S> bon jour , messieurs ! said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by d artagnan and porthos .: 26.78
<S> now , chevalier , he added , turning to aramis , let us go .: 11.24
<S> his majesty has so good a heart that he can not understand hatred ; is so loyal that he does not suspect treason !: 86.75
<S> i have said what i have said . and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation , replied d artagnan , in a low voice , i beg you to follow me . and when ? asked the guardsman , with the same jeering air .: 25.17
<S> believe me , we have passed the time of success in intrigue , and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting paris , where there will always be two queens as long as you are there . oh , cried the duchess , i can not make war alone , but i can avenge myself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favorite on the honor of a duchess , i will avenge myself . madame , replied athos , do not injure the vicomte de bragelonne do not ruin his prospects .: 42.10
<S> she passed the night thus .: 45.37
<S> monte cristo on the contrary , preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor , aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure , and thus possessed the advantage .: 57.65
<S> planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway , while grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable , undertaking that by five o clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready .: 43.28
<S> monte cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies .: 36.64
<S> is he then advancing on paris ? the minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal .: 67.40
<S> a peer of france ? ah , said andrea , who knows ? major cavalcanti is already one , perhaps ; but then , hereditary rank is abolished . no politics , caderousse .: 93.37
<S> so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts , and as d artagnan stood firm , it was his adversary who made the retreating step ; but d artagnan seized the moment at which , in this movement , the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line .: 51.13
<S> to present our respects to the cardinal . porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first , took his beaver and followed d artagnan .: 48.77
<S> the first he comes to !: 78.32
<S> the two musketeers met at the gate .: 14.59
<S> you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have . the abbe smiled .: 37.95
<S> yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy ; he does know how to destroy , and that is half the battle . so , added madame de villefort , constantly returning to her object , the poisons of the borgias , the medicis , the rene es , the ruggieris , and later , probably , that of baron de trenck , whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romance were objects of art , madame , and nothing more , replied the count .: 82.69
<S> the presence of my daughter and myself in france is already irksome to him ; much more so would be that of the king .: 41.47
<S> the prince ! exclaimed at the same moment athos and aramis , unmasking as they addressed the duc de beaufort , whilst d artagnan and porthos stepped backward .: 31.66
<S> here is the paper ; do you know the writing ? as he spoke , villefort drew the letter from his pocket , and presented it to dante s .: 14.81
<S> joy , joy the sum is large ! five or six millions , is it not ? yes , you know the amount . on the receipt of the count of monte cristo ? why , how came you to be so well acquainted with all this ? i told you we were informed beforehand . then why do you apply to me ? that i may be sure i have the right man . yes , it is indeed he .: 37.33
<S> stop !: 27.26
<S> yes , without the saddle . you will observe , gentlemen , said athos , that porthos has made the best bargain of any of us . and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined , to the astonishment of poor porthos ; but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity , he shared it vociferously according to his custom .: 51.19
<S> he is a priest , learned in cases of conscience , and we will tell him ours . it was then agreed that they were to go first to monsieur de bouillon , as his house came first ; but first of all athos begged that he might go to the hotel du grand charlemagne , to see raoul .: 43.55
<S> now , said felton , we are safe . milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted .: 20.05
<S> but before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament , since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him .: 108.55
<S> let me know what crime i have committed .: 30.02
<S> i don t very well know .: 26.19
<S> my english horse , which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust , has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the earth .: 48.66
<S> very well , my dear sir , you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman . but the king where is the king ? exclaimed athos , anxiously .: 24.58
<S> the evidence will support it .: 73.37
<S> the countenances of all gave evidence of terror , for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his eminence , they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his heart .: 56.09
<S> five thousand francs per month !: 37.99
<S> morrel had to pay , within half an hour , 287,500 francs .: 63.09
<S> i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out . it would be very easy if you much wished it ? how so ? probably you have some correspondent in greece ? i should think so . at yanina ? everywhere . well , write to your correspondent in yanina , and ask him what part was played by a frenchman named fernand mondego in the catastrophe of ali tepelini . you are right , exclaimed danglars , rising quickly , i will write today . do so . i will . 30259m and if you should hear of anything very scandalous i will communicate it to you . you will oblige me . danglars rushed out of the room , and made but one leap into his coupe .: 49.55
<S> monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees , said i ; confess how you obtained this animal . benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said , and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity .: 107.01
<S> the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed , and declared that he was dead .: 27.60
<S> ah , assunta , cried i , you are an excellent woman , and heaven will bless you . this , said monte cristo , is less correct than your philosophy , it is only faith . alas , your excellency is right , replied bertuccio , and god made this infant the instrument of our punishment .: 33.04
<S> it is true she speculates with her own money , not mine ; nevertheless , you can understand that when 700,000 francs leave the wife s pocket , the husband always finds it out .: 87.96
<S> nay , said caderousse , one can t always work one is not a dog . so much the better for the dogs , said monte cristo .: 31.29
<S> the whole . but how , my god ? by a mode of proceeding known to myself , and by which i likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinal s police . and what did you understand by what we said ? a thousand things .: 58.34
<S> i will warn them . what the devil are you going to do ? cried d artagnan , you will be shot . but athos heeded not his advice .: 24.38
<S> he embraced juxon and pressed the hand of aramis .: 36.39
<S> ah , my young friend , added the curate , groaning , do not regret the devil , i implore you ! d artagnan felt himself bewildered .: 20.33
<S> there is your money , the same sum as that you have received already .: 50.28
<S> the riot becomes a revolution .: 66.92
<S> if it be so , we trust your eminence will deign to explain yourself , and we should then at least be acquainted with our real position . and if it were an interrogatory ! replied the cardinal .: 40.69
<S> oh , sir , reply , i entreat you is not the comte de la fere a noble whom i remember , handsome and brave , a musketeer under louis xiii. , who must be now about forty seven or forty eight years of age ? yes , sir , you are right in every particular ! and who served under an assumed name ? under the name of athos .: 45.84
<S> what is this ? asked merce de s .: 5.55
<S> before him , on the front seat , lay two pairs of pistols one in front of porthos and the other of d artagnan .: 48.86
<S> the smugglers dante s had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast .: 42.76
<S> thin and lanky . the executioner , said d artagnan and aramis at the same time .: 30.82
<S> de monte cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the champs e lyse es with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing room .: 32.65
<S> but during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from madame de montbazon , which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance , but in what way he knew not .: 51.86
<S> excellencies , said he , the coach is ready . well , then , said franz , let us to the colosseum . by the porta del popolo or by the streets , your excellencies ? by the streets , morbleu ! by the streets ! cried franz .: 27.19
<S> he was not long in making his toilet .: 30.74
<S> then he sent his card to signor pastrini , and asked for albert de morcerf .: 24.73
<S> come , d artagnan , said porthos , bid adieu to your sword and go with me to pierrefonds , to bracieux , or to du vallon .: 38.14
<S> in the midst of this chamber were four stones , which had formerly served as an altar , as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them .: 41.14
<S> a burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain ; and two or three heads , carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment , appeared through the openings of the tapestry .: 37.18
<S> then he placed a sentinel at each door , with an order to admit nobody upon any pretense but his valet de chambre , patrick .: 70.50
<S> are you sure that the other is dead ? the other ? said athos , in so stifled a voice that d artagnan scarcely heard him .: 20.49
<S> but i am not yet ready to receive it . very well .: 20.16
<S> he is he would have added edmond dante s , but the count seized his arm and prevented him .: 37.30
<S> by its side , on her knees , and with her head buried in the cushion of an easy chair , was valentine , trembling and sobbing , her hands extended above her head , clasped and stiff .: 41.21
<S> it wounded the pride of the parliament , which , supported by the citizens , replied by declaring that cardinal mazarin was the cause of all the discontent ; denounced him as the enemy both of the king and the state , and ordered him to retire from the court that same day and from france within a week afterward ; enjoining , in case of disobedience on his part , all the subjects of the king to pursue and take him .: 65.50
<S> athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone , drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time , broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right .: 42.92
<S> if i m not mistaken here s bazin .: 100.58
<S> my lord the cardinal ! mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew back , pushing his chair on the castors .: 42.99
<S> be easy , i am a gentleman .: 17.89
<S> he sat down by the side of the moat , buried his face in his hands and reflected .: 17.40
<S> if it were so with m. morrel unfortunately , replied the count , i am witness that m. morrel can not give up his horse , his honor being engaged in keeping it . how so ? he laid a wager he would tame me de ah in the space of six months .: 57.34
<S> but i was going to tell you that i met m. de morcerf the other day . well ? monsieur franz is his friend , you know . what then ? monsieur de morcerf has received a letter from franz , announcing his immediate return . valentine turned pale , and leaned her hand against the gate .: 28.05
<S> we four will go ; and i hope to god that with our four lackeys we may be in sufficient number . you terrify me , athos ! cried d artagnan .: 43.27
<S> and i say that murders are committed here , said morrel , whose voice , though lower in tone , lost none of its terrible distinctness : i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months .: 88.36
<S> felton , said milady , with a solemnity full of melancholy , imagine that your sister , the daughter of your father , speaks to you .: 27.23
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> and you ? oh , i dare not she forbade my sending for you ; and , as you say , i am myself agitated , feverish and out of sorts .: 46.85
<S> as for franz , he remained at florence , and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the cascine , and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the florentine nobility , he took a fancy into his head having already visited corsica , the cradle of bonaparte to visit elba , the waiting place of napoleon .: 55.29
<S> then , extending his hand , the old man said ; i thank you , my son ; and now leave me alone . yet replied carlini .: 32.50
<S> steps sounded in the chamber , and drew near .: 31.98
<S> they can take place at rueil .: 24.80
<S> then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard : gate ! cried she , with her finest contralto voice , and rapping at the window .: 59.32
<S> the figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attention .: 42.12
<S> m. de villefort was therefore obliged to request m. d avrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city , more especially a death under such suspicious circumstances .: 68.05
<S> she treats her children ill , but she always welcomes strangers . ah , father , said albert with a smile , it is evident you do not know the count of monte cristo ; he despises all honors , and contents himself with those written on his passport . that is the most just remark , replied the stranger , i ever heard made concerning myself . you have been free to choose your career , observed the count of morcerf , with a sigh ; and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers . precisely , monsieur , replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze .: 46.51
<S> i was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the borgias nor the family , but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the arabian nights , which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie .: 55.64
<S> and i for planchet , said d artagnan .: 17.41
<S> it was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder of the duke of buckingham ; it was you who had madame bonacieux carried off ; it was you who , in love with de wardes and thinking to pass the night with him , opened the door to monsieur d artagnan ; it was you who , believing that de wardes had deceived you , wished to have him killed by his rival ; it was you who , when this rival had discovered your infamous secret , wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins , whom you sent in pursuit of him ; it was you who , finding the balls had missed their mark , sent poisoned wine with a forged letter , to make your victim believe that the wine came from his friends .: 49.57
<S> three days afterward the four musketeers were in paris ; they had not exceeded their leave of absence , and that same evening they went to pay their customary visit to m. de tre ville .: 27.52
<S> i do not think so , added cha teau renaud , with the air of a man who knows the whole of the european nobility perfectly .: 17.77
<S> why , it is with him i am also going to fight , said porthos .: 20.54
<S> i gad !: 49.16
<S> they ask my age ; i tell it .: 63.34
<S> it is the hotel rambouillet , cried guitant .: 34.61
<S> danglars left last night ! left ? m .: 198.31
<S> the one seemed to be deprived of reason , yet he was meditating .: 50.08
<S> oh , now i may say so ! so much the better , replied monte cristo ; as that poor edmond will not have long to be loved by you .: 22.27
<S> oh , it must not be called suffering ; i feel a general uneasiness , that is all .: 30.51
<S> bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder .: 36.76
<S> i only ask a brokerage . of course , that is perfectly just , cried m. de boville .: 39.61
<S> she will repent , and no one will know that she has been guilty .: 36.52
<S> athos appeared .: 26.18
<S> it was not to meet me that he came , for he was ignorant of my journey .: 23.42
<S> napoleon would , doubtless , have deprived villefort of his office had it not been for noirtier , who was all powerful at court , and thus the girondin of 93 and the senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had been his protector .: 82.07
<S> come , there can not be too many . 40248m sir , said maximilian , you are not perhaps aware that i am m. de monte cristo s friend ? i was not sure , but i thought it might be so .: 25.01
<S> but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there ; she would see him the next day , and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate , she would , at least , obtain all the indulgence he could allow .: 35.74
<S> the coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his life .: 84.98
<S> after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step , so that the table alone separated them , the unknown took off his mask .: 56.66
<S> he therefore mounted his horse and disappeared .: 21.16
<S> madame , replied aramis , i must ask your pardon , but i know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of henry iv .: 29.35
<S> i was forced , then , to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning .: 37.53
<S> well , said the queen , it has been refused . the two friends exchanged a smile of contempt .: 15.09
<S> set out , therefore , in a week , with your suite , and go to the hotel de la chevrette , rue tiquetonne , and there await me . that s agreed , said porthos .: 20.83
<S> i leave you , therefore , as i took you , rich , but little respected .: 33.95
<S> this strange , unexpected , terrible accusation has disordered your reason .: 118.18
<S> several times lord de winter , porthos , or aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak ; but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed , without response .: 57.88
<S> why , replied dante s , i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words , which are rendered illegible by fire . yes , to you , my friend , who read them for the first time ; but not for me , who have grown pale over them by many nights study , and have reconstructed every phrase , completed every thought . and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning ? i am sure i have , and you shall judge for yourself ; but first listen to the history of this paper . silence ! exclaimed dante s .: 52.22
<S> since the death of madame de saint me ran , i have known that a poisoner lived in my house .: 19.93
<S> he took a pencil , tore a page from his tablets and wrote : my dear marshal , in an hour lens will be in the enemy s possession .: 41.92
<S> courage !: 29.40
<S> he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette .: 21.09
<S> if i may ask without indiscretion . near here , replied de comminges , smiling ; so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are . he is wandering about the environs of the castle , thought d artagnan .: 76.86
<S> now , for my part , i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece ; and hang me , if i can guess where you took your notions of the other world from .: 61.24
<S> every transport of a daughter finding a father , all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover , were felt by hayde e during the first moments of this meeting , which she had so eagerly expected .: 102.08
<S> but it was not you , i presume , who placed at my disposal 100,000 francs , which i spent in four or five months ; it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father ; it was not you who introduced me into the world , and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil , which i fancy i am eating at this moment , in company with the most distinguished people in paris amongst the rest with a certain procureur , whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate , for he would have been very useful to me just now ; it was not you , in fact , who bailed me for one or two millions , when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place .: 46.44
<S> you have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon , i hope , have news that will be agreeable to you . grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew , as was his custom on the entrance of his superior .: 51.23
<S> he was very taciturn , this worthy signor .: 58.55
<S> see , they are here . and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses , accompanied by two mounted gentlemen , arrived at the gate , which opened before them .: 38.22
<S> you here at this hour ? said she .: 18.89
<S> planchet , by way of dessert , would have liked to hear the conversation ; but the citizen declared to d artagnan that , what he had to say being important and confidential , he desired to be left alone with him .: 46.78
<S> i say that he is ill informed .: 24.88
<S> athos chose a black coat , which gave him the appearance of a respectable citizen .: 41.44
<S> i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven . then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged ? i do , indeed ; and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth , my father and merce de s. come , said the abbe , closing his hiding place , and pushing the bed back to its original situation , let me hear your story . dante s obeyed , and commenced what he called his history , but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india , and two or three voyages to the levant , until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise , with the death of captain leclere , and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal ; his interview with that personage , and his receiving , in place of the packet brought , a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtier his arrival at marseilles , and interview with his father his affection for merce de s , and their nuptual feast his arrest and subsequent examination , his temporary detention at the palais de justice , and his final imprisonment in the cha teau d if .: 61.62
<S> fresh sharpened by his victory , full of hopes of future favor , he was resolved not to recoil a step .: 103.64
<S> sometimes on a sunday , i take a ride in the fields and on the property of my neighbours , in order to pick up a nice little quarrel , which i am really in want of , but nothing happens .: 47.81
<S> alas , you , who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength , can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows , without being able to take any active part in them .: 49.18
<S> he would fain have gazed upon his gold , and yet he had not strength enough ; for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him , and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo , terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea fowls with his wild cries and gestures ; then he returned , and , still unable to believe the evidence of his senses , rushed into the grotto , and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels .: 50.11
<S> there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces .: 131.71
<S> milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips , but rage in her heart .: 26.19
<S> we must , therefore , watch and play a close game ; for , he added with a sigh , we two are equal , perhaps , to eight others ; but we are not equal to the four that you know of . that is true , said porthos , echoing d artagnan s sigh .: 36.02
<S> the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment , and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated .: 56.58
<S> he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs , that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy .: 78.33
<S> at four o clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the stables .: 16.57
<S> come , who is my father ? i came to tell you . ah , cried benedetto , his eyes sparkling with joy .: 17.76
<S> however , sire , if i might advise , your majesty will interrogate the person of whom i spoke to you , and i will urge your majesty to do him this honor . most willingly , duke ; under your auspices i will receive any person you please , but you must not expect me to be too confiding .: 51.71
<S> they understood , then , from the few words which escaped from d artagnan , what affair was in hand , and as they thought that overtaking his man , or losing sight of him , d artagnan would return to his rooms , they kept on their way .: 31.84
<S> then he arranged all his beautiful turkish arms , his fine english guns , his japanese china , his cups mounted in silver , his artistic bronzes by feuche res or barye ; examined the cupboards , and placed the key in each ; threw into a drawer of his secretaire , which he left open , all the pocket money he had about him , and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewel boxes ; then he made an exact inventory of everything , and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table , after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there .: 82.24
<S> i am condemned ; leave me to my death . my king , said aramis , they well may raise a scaffold , but they can not make an executioner . what do you mean ? asked the king .: 27.13
<S> no , was the old man s reply , i will not leave this house , for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world ; and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing , and what would he think if i did not wait here for him ? i heard all this from the window , for i was anxious that merce de s should persuade the old man to accompany her , for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment s repose . but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man ? asked the abbe .: 36.98
<S> under what circumstances did we meet ? he asked again .: 31.40
<S> but tell me now , count , exclaimed albert , delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo ; tell me truly whether you are in earnest , or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives , but which , like a house built on the sand , is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind ? i pledge you my honor , returned the count , that i mean to do as i have said ; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris . when do you propose going thither ? have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself ? certainly i have ; in a fortnight or three weeks time , that is to say , as fast as i can get there ! nay , said the count ; i will give you three months ere i join you ; you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties .: 53.46
<S> as soon as these studs shall be in your possession , inform me .: 41.55
<S> my father , who was such a brave soldier , whose career was so brilliant oh , well , he will add , we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf , who also bears the same christian name . i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation . and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses , do you ? yes . you do wrong . which means , i suppose , that you refuse the service which i asked of you ? you know my theory regarding duels ; i told you my opinion on that subject , if you remember , when we were at rome . nevertheless , my dear count , i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain . because , my dear fellow , you understand one must never be eccentric .: 57.78
<S> porthos agreed to the bargain ; the thing suited him wonderfully well .: 110.76
<S> is there a secret spring ? said valentine .: 29.23
<S> d artagnan rose , and taking a letter from his writing desk , presented it to raoul .: 22.30
<S> what are you looking at there ?: 23.05
<S> you will find your horses in bad condition , from the results of this accident ; they seem thoroughly stupefied , as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man .: 122.22
<S> gentlemen , your hands ; are we not pretty good christians ? egad ! said d artagnan , by heaven !: 31.53
<S> all this will not advance your outfit , said athos ; for if i am not mistaken , you have left the best of your apparel with milady , and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you .: 32.52
<S> d artagnan was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments .: 34.76
<S> where the devil shall i say that he is , so that he can not try to rejoin him ? thought d artagnan .: 22.78
<S> the comte de la fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you .: 14.15
<S> shivering for want of a fagot !: 129.72
<S> come , come ! said milady , lifting hers to her mouth , do as i do . but at the moment the glass touched her lips , her hand remained suspended ; she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop .: 39.84
<S> do you talk of a sacrifice ? i do . do you then suspect anyone ? i suspect no one ; death raps at your door it enters it goes , not blindfolded , but circumspectly , from room to room .: 121.33
<S> order out the carriage , he said , and remove the pistols which are in the holsters .: 41.40
<S> ah , he s quite another sort of person a formidable gentleman , indeed .: 77.34
<S> dante s himself only knew that which personally concerned him , for he never beheld again the five persons i have named to you , or heard mention of anyone of them . well , when dante s was arrested , monsieur morrel hastened to obtain the particulars , and they were very sad .: 69.21
<S> well , i have not intercepted your confidence , and yet i know all that as well as you , and i have no conscientious scruples .: 27.70
<S> he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out , saw the monk , and fell back upon the litter , his face illumined by joy .: 36.18
<S> you heard cavalcanti . that tells me their name , and nothing else . ah !: 65.41
<S> there now , shall we start ? when you like ; but have you no groom ? no ; that idiot bazin had the folly to make himself verger , as you know , and therefore can not leave notre dame .: 61.96
<S> does he still live ? inquired the innkeeper .: 34.71
<S> this was the gist of his strange story : the first barrel that grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struck it was empty .: 71.03
<S> monsieur de st. merri , you begin . my lord , i have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to you . who and what is this man ? a shopkeeper in the rue des lombards , who has great influence upon the commerce of his quarter . what is his name ? he is named planchet , who himself also caused a rising about six weeks ago ; but as he was searched for after this emeute he disappeared . and can you find him ? i hope so .: 48.03
<S> under the oldest and thickest of these trees , reclining on cushions , sat my father ; my mother was at his feet , and i , childlike , amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle , or with the diamond hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle .: 65.03
<S> no one will come , said she ; do not fear , there is our safeguard , pointing to the bed .: 26.28
<S> count , said emmanuel , when they were at the end of the place royale , put me down at my door , that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours . if it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph , said morrel , i would invite the count to our house ; besides that , he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort .: 41.21
<S> the concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the abbe faria had spread the riches of his mind .: 39.81
<S> this lad , for he was scarcely a man , simple , natural , eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for ; full of affection for everybody , because he was happy , and because happiness renders even the wicked good extended his affection even to his judge , spite of villefort s severe look and stern accent .: 124.18
<S> he wouldn t listen , put his foot on the spur to get down , the spur broke , he fell with a broken leg , and , instead of keeping quiet , took to crying out like a gallows bird .: 63.19
<S> how much did the jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it ? said athos .: 36.66
<S> planchet , the most intelligent of the four , was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired , and which was accompanied , as may be remembered , by rochefort s servant .: 50.59
<S> franz and albert were opposite the via delle muratte ; the coachman , without saying a word , drove up it , passed along the piazza di spagna and the rospoli palace and stopped at the door of the hotel .: 27.07
<S> aramis returned soon with a man from the hotel de rohan , who was saying to him : you swear , sir , that it is not so ? stop , and aramis gave him a louis d or .: 40.10
<S> the sentiments you air are certainly fine , so fine that they are superhuman . however that may be , d artagnan , replied athos , without falling into the snare which his gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love , however that may be , you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true ; but i am wrong to dispute with my master .: 56.09
<S> the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his ; and , in spite of his efforts to prevent it , the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last , vainly calling for his son .: 54.39
<S> the two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions .: 31.14
<S> sir , he said , there is one window of the convent lighted up . hem !: 30.35
<S> a nightly patrol .: 158.19
<S> as for villefort , instead of sending to paris , he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dante s , in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely , that is , a second restoration .: 62.27
<S> you may , therefore , comprehend , that being of no country , asking no protection from any government , acknowledging no man as my brother , not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful , or the obstacles which paralyze the weak , paralyzes or arrests me .: 110.84
<S> when i saw her weeping i began to cry too .: 70.42
<S> and what did he say , or rather do ? ali placed himself in the light , so that his master might see him distinctly , and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man , he closed his eyes , as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes . good ; he accepts , said monte cristo .: 41.21
<S> is it my fault if fortune , which has frowned on you , has been kind to me ? fortune has been kind to you , then ?: 47.25
<S> porthos bowed , as if in assent .: 35.12
<S> meantime d artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier , attacking him with his sword .: 26.58
<S> it would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which villefort left the palais .: 37.31
<S> now , athos ! said d artagnan , do you begin to believe that it s a ruined cause , and that what with your harrisons , joyces , bridges and cromwells , we shall never get the upper hand ? the king will be delivered at the tribunal , said athos ; the very silence of his supporters indicates that they are at work . d artagnan shrugged his shoulders .: 46.27
<S> this woman exercised over him an unaccountable power ; he hated and adored her at the same time .: 56.31
<S> you are right ; and upon my soul , i would give my life for a hair , said athos .: 23.04
<S> i suppose that is not all . to take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we can not wake up mazarin a little . a bad plan ; you ll be shut up again in the bastile . oh , as to that , i shall take care , i assure you .: 50.20
<S> how do you mean ? yes ; pray take a cigar , and cease to defend yourself , and to struggle to escape marrying mademoiselle danglars .: 31.32
<S> well , said he , extending his hand to monte cristo , i suppose you have come to sympathize with me , for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house .: 15.05
<S> i told you this , i am now grieved i have kept my word .: 25.34
<S> twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative , whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in england she was already married in france .: 79.61
<S> well , don t you intend to bring me another plate ? said dante s .: 14.26
<S> he stooped down , picked up the bag of money , and placed it between his teeth .: 27.41
<S> the coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the st. eustache church , watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling .: 73.39
<S> he had only been back an hour or two ; he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement , or else at least to the first relay .: 36.00
<S> i depend on you .: 31.14
<S> we take him to the other side of the french frontier , and offer him hospitality at bourges . at bourges ? yes , he has not much to complain of ; bourges is the capital of charles vii .: 46.82
<S> d artagnan was the first to recover from his surprise .: 15.09
<S> edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay ; the waves , dashing themselves against it , wetted him with their spray .: 63.73
<S> d artagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care , in parting . yes , count ; nor have i lost sight of him for a single instant since . then , said athos in a tone of delight , he is well ?: 32.15
<S> let us talk a little , said she .: 12.80
<S> sir ? my friend , my dear maximilian , do not make a hasty resolution , i entreat you . i make a hasty resolution ? said morrel , shrugging his shoulders ; is there anything extraordinary in a journey ? 50125m maximilian , said the count , let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed .: 39.92
<S> my dear dante s , said he , swear to perform what i am going to tell you , for it is a matter of the deepest importance . i swear , captain , replied i .: 18.40
<S> it formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife , and it is magnificent .: 80.72
<S> when i am dead , you will go and examine it . what ? said morrel , you dead ? yes ; must i not be prepared for everything , dear friend ?: 29.86
<S> all was over ; carriages , horses , guards , and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds , when all at once a voice well known to raoul was heard , and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air ; at the same time the crowd opened , upset , trodden down , and an officer of the musketeers , striking and cutting right and left , rushed up to raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall .: 48.08
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> well , sir , though honor is a fine thing , they are tired of fighting for it , and to night they have sold you for two hundred thousand pounds that is to say , for half what is owing them . impossible ! cried the king , the scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds !: 47.74
<S> do you intend to sit up for me ? no ; but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house , i am alarmed every time i hear a door open , particularly in the night .: 55.37
<S> albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair .: 41.85
<S> at the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people .: 44.70
<S> villefort , drawn by an irresistible attraction , like that of the bird to the serpent , walked towards the house .: 45.63
<S> she had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal , and relate everything to him ; but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the part of athos .: 35.88
<S> at the queen s last word , d artagnan had dragged porthos into the gallery .: 28.20
<S> vampa then removed the stone , and cucumetto came out .: 44.96
<S> but do you wish to marry andrea , my dear m. danglars , that you are asking so many questions ? ma foi , said danglars , it would not be a bad speculation , i fancy , and you know i am a speculator . you are not thinking of mademoiselle danglars , i hope ; you would not like poor andrea to have his throat cut by albert ? albert , repeated danglars , shrugging his shoulders ; ah , well ; he would care very little about it , i think . but he is betrothed to your daughter , i believe ? well , m. de morcerf and i have talked about this marriage , but madame de morcerf and albert you do not mean to say that it would not be a good match ? indeed , i imagine that mademoiselle danglars is as good as m. de morcerf . mademoiselle danglars fortune will be great , no doubt , especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes . oh , i do not mean her fortune only ; but tell me what ? why did you not invite m. and madame de morcerf to your dinner ? i did so , but he excused himself on account of madame de morcerf being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of sea air . yes , yes , said danglars , laughing , it would do her a great deal of good . why so ? because it is the air she always breathed in her youth . monte cristo took no notice of this ill natured remark .: 36.81
<S> now , said planchet , let us bind him to a tree . this being properly done , they drew the comte de wardes close to his servant ; and as night was approaching , and as the wounded man and the bound man were at some little distance within the wood , it was evident they were likely to remain there till the next day .: 47.99
<S> stop , said he , i have an idea . well , that s something , for i have not the shadow of one , said athos coolly ; but as to d artagnan , gentlemen , the idea of belonging to ours has driven him out of his senses .: 30.29
<S> he flattered himself he should be able to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric , which he might , if not killed upon the spot , relate to everybody a recital which , well managed , would cover porthos with ridicule .: 80.57
<S> give me drink , said he : i thirst i burn ! monte cristo gave him a glass of water .: 40.93
<S> d artagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies .: 33.82
<S> there , again , monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts .: 34.11
<S> well , said the president ; your name ? i can not tell you my name , since i do not know it ; but i know my father s , and can tell it to you . a painful giddiness overwhelmed villefort ; great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand .: 32.48
<S> he did so , and thus doubled his income .: 39.50
<S> at the end of a passage paved with bricks , was a little garden , bathed in sunshine , and rich in warmth and light .: 39.07
<S> no one answered to his first knocking .: 38.82
<S> at that moment a hand touched his shoulder .: 23.82
<S> when he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop .: 55.07
<S> i shall complain to m. de villefort of the impertinence of his servants . madame , this is precaution , not impertinence ; no one enters here without an order from m. d avrigny , or without speaking to the procureur . well , i have business with the procureur . is it pressing business ? you can imagine so , since i have not even brought my carriage out yet .: 57.51
<S> he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered , and said : you seem geographically engaged , sir ?: 47.43
<S> yes , sir , answered mousqueton ; but permit me to say i see nothing laughable in it .: 30.02
<S> let me see it , said milady .: 9.71
<S> you have seen your dream realized . i can still say it is a dream ; a retired baker , my poor benedetto , is rich he has an annuity . well , you have an annuity . i have ? 40134m yes , since i bring you your two hundred francs . caderousse shrugged his shoulders .: 43.79
<S> it is some superior officer making his night rounds , said athos .: 86.15
<S> excuse me , sirs , this is not a servant , but a friend .: 17.17
<S> you see , i have been a soldier ever since i attained manhood .: 52.10
<S> he was concealed in a thicket ; he saw my father bury something in the ground , and stabbed him ; then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground , and found me still living .: 73.92
<S> all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended .: 59.08
<S> porthos and aramis did the same .: 16.80
<S> the closet was empty .: 22.59
<S> and he is dead ? yes . well , sir , said d arminges , it is the common lot ; even an executioner is not exempted .: 33.68
<S> let us see what porthos has found for supper . and thanking the captain , he regained the state cabin , where his friends were .: 67.63
<S> there was no great cunning necessary .: 45.04
<S> ah , pardon !: 14.85
<S> but bazin , still the servant of a musketeer , when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks , seized a broomstick and began belaboring blaisois , saying : you have insulted the church , my friend , you have insulted the church ! at this moment aramis , aroused by this unusual disturbance , cautiously opened the door of his room ; and blaisois , looking reproachfully at the cerberus , drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to aramis .: 39.16
<S> yes , his mother . but does he know this secret , then ? i mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession . unhappy man ! cried grimaud , whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause ; unhappy man , you named no one , i hope ? i pronounced no name , for i knew none , except his mother s , as a young girl , and it was by this name that he recognized her , but he knows that his uncle was among her judges . thus speaking , he fell back exhausted .: 58.97
<S> let them wait for me at the pomme de pin .: 33.87
<S> allow me to observe , madame , said the count , with that kind tone he could assume so well , you are really very severe with that dear clever child . oh , sometimes severity is quite necessary , replied madame de villefort , with all a mother s real firmness .: 38.90
<S> the duke was at windsor hunting with the king .: 35.22
<S> immediately a brilliant light from the next room , or rather from the palace adjoining , shone upon the room in which he was gently gliding into his last sleep .: 60.44
<S> then he descended with cautious and slow step , for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality .: 97.20
<S> not i , unfortunately ! said porthos .: 24.43
<S> some madman or fool , bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can , actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost ; and the fact is , i have gained 16,000 francs by the sale of them .: 85.92
<S> we four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain .: 269.94
<S> we went by bologna , perugia , and rome . ah , yes true , mademoiselle , exclaimed monte cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought .: 43.24
<S> who could have said so the evening before ?: 45.28
<S> but as for me , i have been a coward ; i have denied god and he has abandoned me . 50213m merce de s burst into tears ; her woman s heart was breaking under its load of memories .: 40.46
<S> or rather , to observe the chronological order , i and d artagnan , replied athos .: 41.23
<S> if victorious , i shall continue the struggle ; if beaten , i am lost .: 65.61
<S> i accept it , said she ; he has a right to pay the dowry , which i shall take with me to some convent ! putting the letter in her bosom , she took her son s arm , and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs .: 46.04
<S> it was still about a quarter full , as we before stated .: 55.25
<S> how i have suffered ! said milady , in that harmonious voice which , like that of the ancient enchantresses , charmed all whom she wished to destroy .: 45.37
<S> so you suppose i have need of an escort ?: 33.92
<S> no , sir , but i am severely . what can we do ? said d artagnan ; we must return to paris . i will take care of mousqueton , said grimaud ; and he gave his arm to his old comrade , whose eyes were full of tears , nor could grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again .: 25.87
<S> they are good soldiers , fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful of . oh ! cried athos .: 130.70
<S> you don t know them .: 16.45
<S> your friend , albert de morcerf .: 31.01
<S> did your excellency desire to see me ? inquired he .: 17.62
<S> now , of two hundred and fifty one members who composed the parliament , there were one hundred and ninety one who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon .: 70.66
<S> anyone else would have hastened to receive him ; but villefort was a man of ability , and he knew this would be a sign of weakness .: 34.40
<S> the aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter , but by waiting , he could still cling to hope , and retard the certainty of deception .: 65.36
<S> now go , returned franz , or i shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore , who is mine also ; he is an old friend of mine , who has plundered me pretty well already , and , in the hope of making more out of me , he will take a less price than the one i offer you ; you will lose the preference , and that will be your fault . do not give yourselves the trouble , excellency , returned signor pastrini , with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat ; i will do all i can , and i hope you will be satisfied . and now we understand each other . when do you wish the carriage to be here ? in an hour . in an hour it will be at the door . an hour after the vehicle was at the door ; it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion , but , in spite of its humble exterior , the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival .: 39.49
<S> monte cristo descended into the courtyard , walked all over the house , without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure , until he entered his bedroom , situated on the opposite side to the closed room ; then he approached a little piece of furniture , made of rosewood , which he had noticed at a previous visit .: 36.27
<S> it is , then , interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it , particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence .: 69.98
<S> the event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his ideas .: 56.62
<S> the lackeys were brought by the cries she made .: 49.69
<S> what do you think of the plan , gentlemen ? admirable ! replied the young men in chorus .: 15.83
<S> time passed on , and the two young people had agreed to be married when vampa should be twenty and teresa nineteen years of age .: 43.87
<S> not at all .: 22.18
<S> i should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this time . upon my soul , these women would puzzle the very devil to read them aright .: 113.65
<S> and this gentleman , being disengaged , takes to the service willingly ? he asked .: 67.74
<S> then he is not dead ? 30213m no ; you see plainly he is not dead .: 33.73
<S> this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner ; but dante s feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention .: 42.23
<S> my mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved .: 66.79
<S> comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen s carriage .: 24.39
<S> and you have come here with that purpose ? grimaud repeated the sign .: 28.82
<S> one moment , my lord , whispered athos , and he said something in a low voice .: 22.07
<S> athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte .: 34.85
<S> poor edward is as much m. noirtier s grandchild as valentine , and yet , if she had not been going to marry m. franz , m. noirtier would have left her all his money ; and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather , she will still be three times richer than he . the count listened and said no more .: 42.71
<S> it is his voice ! all still remained silent , the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared , endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness .: 39.34
<S> villefort s conduct , therefore , upon reflection , appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage .: 66.37
<S> at the end of an hour she was completely out of sight ; at least , it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was .: 21.22
<S> you agree that the foundation , the trademark owner , and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual , direct , indirect , consequential , punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage .: 14.90
<S> they took the bridge .: 35.75
<S> in the first instance to marseilles , madame . to marseilles ! exclaimed the young couple .: 30.21
<S> but our troop horses ? said aramis .: 77.77
<S> oh , not a word , said she in a concentrated voice , not a word of all that i have said to you to this man , or i am lost , and it would be you you then as the steps drew near , she became silent for fear of being heard , applying , with a gesture of infinite terror , her beautiful hand to felton s mouth .: 38.47
<S> do you , perchance , think i set any great store by life ? there is something horribly mysterious under all this , athos ; this woman is one of the cardinal s spies , i am sure of that . in that case , take care !: 45.42
<S> then the soldier , gagged and bound , was placed upon the hearth , the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends .: 31.72
<S> morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air , and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there .: 66.22
<S> lack a day !: 218.08
<S> the king ?: 42.58
<S> you have not guessed rightly .: 26.14
<S> the beggar the evening passed on ; madame de villefort expressed a desire to return to paris , which madame danglars had not dared to do , notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced .: 43.78
<S> oh , mon dieu !: 6.78
<S> the duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier , so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive .: 48.13
<S> stand on one side , d artagnan , stand on one side , cried athos .: 20.31
<S> mazarin is almost king , answered athos ; madame henrietta is almost no longer queen . if you would condescend to be clever , athos , observed aramis , i really do think you would be wittier than poor monsieur de voiture . athos smiled .: 59.61
<S> my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations , for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left , in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side , while it left me unharmed . dear maximilian , why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety ?: 89.28
<S> danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage .: 33.78
<S> there only his memory returned to him .: 45.43
<S> proof of this crime will be found on arresting him , for the letter will be found upon him , or at his father s , or in his cabin on board the pharaon . very good , resumed danglars ; now your revenge looks like common sense , for in no way can it revert to yourself , and the matter will thus work its own way ; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing , and write upon it , to the king s attorney , and that s all settled . and danglars wrote the address as he spoke .: 60.91
<S> no ; he warms me with his rays , and it is by his light that i see you nothing more .: 51.11
<S> section 3 .: 18.45
<S> yes , that is true , said she , and i will confess to your majesty that my husband your husband has none .: 21.14
<S> the breeze had been so light all night , they had made but little progress .: 71.41
<S> and what did he say to you ? asked me questions about the vessel , the time she left marseilles , the course she had taken , and what was her cargo .: 53.11
<S> albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller , but , to his great surprise , the latter , without seeking for the signatures , many of which , indeed , were only initials , named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him , but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him .: 58.73
<S> monsieur porthos , what do you say to that ? i say it is easy enough , answered porthos .: 15.75
<S> the suicide chapter 93 .: 35.66
<S> monsieur baptistin especially ; i could never get such a man as that .: 60.91
<S> he was therefore instantly recompensed , either for his address or for his sensibility , whichever it might be termed .: 71.78
<S> milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom ; she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair , and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty .: 28.90
<S> the doctors are embalming the corpse , and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted chapel . mockery , muttered athos , savagely ; royal honors to one whom they have murdered ! well , cheer up ! said a loud voice from the staircase , which porthos had just mounted .: 84.30
<S> they are .: 40.89
<S> one thing alone frightened her ; that was the remembrance of her husband , the comte de la fe re , whom she had believed dead , or at least expatriated , and whom she found again in athos the best friend of d artagnan .: 37.51
<S> you wished it to be preceded by all these titles . it is quite wonderful , mr. president , how entirely you have read my thoughts , said benedetto , in his softest voice and most polite manner .: 47.63
<S> the baron took the young officer by the arm , and turned his head over his shoulder , so as not to lose sight of milady till he was gone out .: 24.10
<S> and in justice to villefort , it must be understood that m. noirtier , who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject , had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort , so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel , or the baron d e pinay , as he was alternately styled , according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name , or by the title which had been conferred on him , fell the victim of assassination , and not that he was killed fairly in a duel .: 52.34
<S> my son ! exclaimed athos , pressing him in his arms .: 14.81
<S> i have just had the pleasure , replied the count ; but i have not seen your father . see , he is down there , talking politics with that little group of great geniuses . indeed ? said monte cristo ; and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent .: 47.48
<S> then she cried , ahem ! under cover of the mea culpa , striking her breast so vigorously that everybody , even the lady with the red cushion , turned round toward her .: 117.46
<S> he wished to articulate a last farewell , but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat , like a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre .: 35.33
<S> i will break every bone in your body ! cried the duke .: 26.57
<S> a few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law .: 36.70
<S> and you responded to his bidding , you imprudent man ? well , i can t say i had much choice of going or not going , for i was taken to him between two guards .: 67.61
<S> you see , said lord de winter , presenting d artagnan to his sister , a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands , and who has not abused his advantage , although we have been twice enemies , although it was i who insulted him , and although i am an englishman .: 28.20
<S> i see no one and yet the ladder didn t come down of itself . no , it is bazin . ah !: 56.78
<S> the king , seeing that he did not reply , repeated his question .: 16.79
<S> not a sound was heard in the castle , except of a footstep up and down , in the chamber above as he supposed , the bedroom of athos .: 69.00
<S> are you sure ? that she is called so ?: 42.81
<S> bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of st. paul or of the place de gre ve ; it was at the traitor s cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end !: 98.26
<S> bravo , bravi , brava ! the banker was enthusiastic in his applause .: 52.85
<S> a light cloud passed over the count s face .: 17.77
<S> the president read : mr .: 46.36
<S> the young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed , and a smile of pride passed over his lips .: 24.43
<S> my mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which i could not rouse myself .: 52.31
<S> it is his way , and you must take him as you find him . at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act .: 30.04
<S> look at the comte de la fere , a type of nobility , a flower of chivalry .: 16.18
<S> she is a remarkable woman , and i only regret that there does not exist another like her , about twenty years younger ; in that case , i assure you , there would very soon be a countess and viscountess of morcerf .: 45.69
<S> oh , my brain whirls ; i no longer understand anything .: 44.67
<S> the baroness then thought of m. de villefort .: 14.08
<S> how i worked , how i hoped , how i struck every piece of turf , thinking to find some resistance to my spade !: 119.71
<S> his complexion was pale , not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty , but of a bilious , yellow hue ; his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head , and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression .: 75.96
<S> during all this time a sentinel , who had been relieved at eight o clock , had been watching his door .: 27.40
<S> ah ! said d artagnan to himself , can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds ?: 12.42
<S> where are we going ? asked he , by a gesture .: 14.30
<S> but this last circumstance was not striking , as the queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept much .: 84.56
<S> he is a proud soul he is a man by himself !: 52.74
<S> this man evidently possesses the power of influencing events , both as regards men and things .: 109.61
<S> i dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you ? d artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said , i ask alms of no man . oh , that s very well , young man , continued m. de tre ville , that s all very well .: 27.42
<S> pardon me , monsieur , said d artagnan , who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back m. de tre ville s clock three quarters of an hour , but i thought , as it was yet only twenty five minutes past nine , it was not too late to wait upon you . twenty five minutes past nine ! cried m. de tre ville , looking at the clock ; why , that s impossible ! look , rather , monsieur , said d artagnan , the clock shows it . that s true , said m. de tre ville ; i believed it later .: 22.31
<S> the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path ; and then some fine morning he will arrest d artagnan , and for fear he should feel lonely , he will send us to keep him company in the bastille . go to !: 52.42
<S> i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me ; i can believe that , had you been madame de chevreuse , poor buckingham might have hoped .: 46.44
<S> you can not mean that ! ah , my dear monsieur bonacieux , you are generous in this matter .: 28.35
<S> you are ungrateful , d artagnan , said athos ; yes , ungrateful to providence , to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner .: 36.01
<S> messieurs musketeers , i will not have this haunting of bad places , this quarreling in the streets , this swordplay at the crossways ; and above all , i will not have occasion given for the cardinal s guards , who are brave , quiet , skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested , and who , besides , never allow themselves to be arrested , to laugh at you !: 58.85
<S> not crush that accursed race ? murmured he ; abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment ?: 188.46
<S> gentlemen , thus d artagnan addressed the four musketeers , i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner , and since there are no locks to the carriage , i shall sit beside him .: 69.75
<S> at length a hand and an arm , surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness , glided through the tapestry .: 67.04
<S> because i am too young to die ! the woman you poisoned at be thune was still younger than you , madame , and yet she is dead , said d artagnan .: 42.77
<S> the notary ! she exclaimed , let him come in . the notary , who was at the door , immediately entered .: 21.69
<S> yes , yes , continued m. de tre ville , growing warmer as he spoke , and his majesty was right ; for , upon my honor , it is true that the musketeers make but a miserable figure at court .: 33.29
<S> yes , it was so , my lord , it was so in the left side , and with a knife .: 25.37
<S> the unfortunate barrois has been poisoned , said d avrigny , and i will maintain this assertion before god and man . villefort said nothing , but he clasped his hands , opened his haggard eyes , and , overcome with his emotion , sank into a chair .: 42.52
<S> is that your name , monsieur ? my very own .: 53.55
<S> retire , valentine , said she ; you are really suffering , and these ladies will excuse you ; drink a glass of pure water , it will restore you . valentine kissed euge nie , bowed to madame danglars , who had already risen to take her leave , and went out .: 32.43
<S> she has never been so kind before .: 49.90
<S> to men who had risked their lives for him , and besides had done him a great service ? a great service what was that ? why , it seems that i crushed for him a parliament councillor . what !: 69.21
<S> my dear count , if you tell me many more marvellous things , i warn you i shall not believe them . i countenance nothing that is marvellous , m. albert .: 37.48
<S> oh , i confess it is all the same to me . oh , you need not avow this religious indifference , my lord ; your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for it . what , you talk of debaucheries , madame messalina , lady macbeth !: 70.10
<S> there must be plenty left , replied d artagnan .: 22.02
<S> morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him .: 85.62
<S> stand here , don t stir , turn your back to the road and wait for me . having thus spoken , d artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village .: 60.50
<S> i took the mule and the horse for what he owed us ; he assured me that they were two noble steeds . well , madame , said porthos , if he owed you more than five crowns , your horsedealer is a thief . there is no harm in trying to buy things cheap , monsieur porthos , said the procurator s wife , seeking to excuse herself .: 40.00
<S> i dragged myself as far as the yard .: 33.61
<S> at twelve this man was replaced by another functionary , and danglars , wishing to catch sight of his new guardian , approached the door again .: 53.37
<S> the latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets , when , headed by the coadjutor , appeared the prince de conti the brother of the prince de conde and the duc de longueville , his brother in law .: 27.69
<S> at eleven o clock albert had not come back .: 15.04
<S> i have , however , already told you , sir , i was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter . yes ; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed , said villefort .: 17.67
<S> if when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits you , the captain will have you thrown into the sea .: 51.53
<S> and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de cha teau renaud , leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf .: 33.19
<S> only imagine what happiness that would afford me .: 131.71
<S> porthos comprehended that this chest , although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams , must be the blessed coffer , and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the dream .: 63.27
<S> well , has anybody come out ? no , but somebody has gone in . a man or a woman ? a man . ah !: 38.28
<S> then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms .: 29.70
<S> besides which , the musketeer , after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him , broached the matter first .: 65.98
<S> although almost engaged to the leaders of the fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a stepping stone .: 107.13
<S> notwithstanding all the pains he took , d artagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three new made friends .: 79.04
<S> i am a faithful subject of the king , madame , and all that his majesty commands i shall do . well , it is true ! said anne of austria ; and the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully .: 26.20
<S> therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened , and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans . sir , said the count , the world , unjust as it is , will be pleased with your resolution ; your friends will be proud of you , and m. d e pinay , even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry , which he will not do , would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty . at the conclusion of these words , the count rose to depart .: 46.00
<S> shall further inquiries be made ?: 311.46
<S> pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight , and follow me . but i can not leave paris just now without knowing aramis stopped .: 43.36
<S> eh !: 18.68
<S> the citizen followed him .: 30.01
<S> poor woman , poor woman , what have they done with you ? you have promised to be secret , my good monsieur ? said the old man .: 32.38
<S> he recounted , with circumstantial exactitude , all the particulars of the supper , the hashish , the statues , the dream , and how , at his awakening , there remained no proof or trace of all these events , save the small yacht , seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio .: 74.25
<S> i trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations , but a foreign lord has arrived from england and waits in the parlor , demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty . oh , a letter !: 57.94
<S> the instant debray had touched the ground , he was at the carriage door .: 43.55
<S> you have a charming young person with you tonight , count , said euge nie .: 17.91
<S> and whom i advised you to strangle , porthos , said aramis .: 26.89
<S> as to d artagnan , he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black .: 19.20
<S> here , monsieur mazarin is everything . does he desire to play the part in france that cromwell plays in england ? oh , no !: 52.50
<S> i understand , answered porthos , i understand you perfectly , on my honor ; two hundred louis , each of us , would be making a pretty thing of it ; but what will people say ? let them say what they will ; besides , how will they know that we are doing it ? but who will distribute these things ? asked porthos .: 37.88
<S> the comte de toiras retired into the citadel st. martin with his garrison , and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of la pre e .: 60.40
<S> d artagnan observed , on the bench nearest to the pillar against which porthos leaned , a sort of ripe beauty , rather yellow and rather dry , but erect and haughty under her black hood .: 96.61
<S> go . morrel looked towards noirtier for permission to retire .: 59.45
<S> she began counting them , remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart ; and still she doubted , the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death .: 73.69
<S> i have , replied d artagnan , pulling out his treasure from his pocket , and placing it on the table .: 14.31
<S> but you only asked 100,000 francs for a fowl ! we have a fixed price for all our provisions .: 90.27
<S> oh , yes , it is she ! a voice of strange sweetness ? how do you know it ? the executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk , who became livid .: 27.31
<S> a rich englishman , continued the abbe , who had been his companion in misfortune , but had been released from prison during the second restoration , was possessed of a diamond of immense value ; this jewel he bestowed on dante s upon himself quitting the prison , as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dante s had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement .: 76.89
<S> it was a coupe of koller s building , and with horses and harness for which drake had , to the knowledge of all the lions of paris , refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas .: 57.21
<S> count , said he , you have offered us places in your carriage , and at your windows in the rospoli palace .: 21.01
<S> dante s struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe , which entered someway between the interstices .: 50.13
<S> that will be sufficient . you think so ? certainly . very well , then . if they should hear of the separation ah , yes ; what could i say ? that an unfaithful tutor , bought over by the enemies of your family by the corsinari ? precisely .: 53.00
<S> what s the matter at the cha teau d if ? said the captain .: 10.56
<S> it s a piece of good fortune sent from heaven , said athos , evidently much relieved .: 43.56

<S> my dear m. debray , said the banker , do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars , for you can hear them as well tomorrow ; but i claim tonight and will devote it , if you will allow me , to talk over some serious matters with my wife . this time the blow was so well aimed , and hit so directly , that lucien and the baroness were staggered , and they interrogated each other with their eyes , as if to seek help against this aggression , but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed , and the husband was victorious .: 64.92
<S> i , my lord , said the latter , i know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of revolt .: 31.08
<S> raoul sprang from his horse , to which he left the charge of its own preservation , and in three or four strokes was at the gentleman s side ; he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water ; the animal began to breathe again and , as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid , redoubled his efforts .: 44.28
<S> the silence , however , could not last forever .: 34.78
<S> she inquired if the baron was still at the castle .: 44.98

<S> i am enormously anxious to finish my night at the duke of bracciano s. they found the carriage where they had left it .: 42.43
<S> madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house ; the continual silence of the spot oppressed her ; still , seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings , she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone , which , contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes , seemed like moonlight on a statue , yielding light without warmth .: 90.23
<S> but , hush , here comes somebody . tis caderousse , who has heard of your arrival , and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return . ah , lips that say one thing , while the heart thinks another , murmured edmond .: 81.92

<S> i fear an attack myself , after all these disasters . oh , man ! murmured d avrigny , the most selfish of all animals , the most personal of all creatures , who believes the earth turns , the sun shines , and death strikes for him alone , an ant cursing god from the top of a blade of grass !: 116.81
<S> god forbid that the queen should suffer the least inconvenience or uneasiness on my account !: 57.97
<S> no cardinal ! said d artagnan , but only his lantern ; where the devil , then , is he ? exploring , however , one of the side wings of the gallery , after making a sign to porthos to explore the other , he saw , all at once , at his left , a tub containing an orange tree , which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture .: 47.33
<S> if you deprive me of that , take away my life also . we are forbidden to shed your blood . and by whom are you forbidden ? by him we obey . you do , then , obey someone ? yes , a chief . i thought you said you were the chief ? so i am of these men ; but there is another over me . and did your superior order you to treat me in this way ? yes . but my purse will be exhausted . probably . come , said danglars , will you take a million ? no . two millions ? three ? four ?: 54.42

<S> this frequently happened .: 81.27
<S> your arrival here , without waiting my visit at your house today , looks well , sir , said albert .: 47.45
<S> he was a man between thirty nine and forty years of age , of medium height but a very well proportioned figure ; with an intellectual and animated physiognomy ; his beard black , and his hair turning gray , as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad , more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion .: 97.02

<S> you will hear again from me . come , come , thought d artagnan , emerging from behind the curtain , decidedly monsieur planchet is no fool ; it is evident he has been brought up in a good school . the different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another , without uttering a single word ; the queen standing near the door , d artagnan half out of his hiding place , the king raised on his elbow , ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude , but instead of approaching , the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away .: 49.37

<S> aramis saluted , then turning toward athos : i don t care to camp on the place royale with all these people , he said .: 42.58

<S> now , sir , you have but to say the word , and i will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms . the blow had struck home , and danglars was entirely vanquished ; with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count , who held them carelessly between finger and thumb , and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures , with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting , had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker .: 67.17
<S> i have told you that i was traveling on an important mission .: 21.16
<S> faria saw this .: 85.14

<S> through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers , and guessed the subject of their parley .: 36.89

<S> i left him about five minutes ago , and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries . but to do this he must have spoken ? he has done better than that he has made himself understood . how was such a thing possible ? by the help of his eyes , which are still full of life , and , as you perceive , possess the power of inflicting mortal injury . my dear , said madame de villefort , who had just entered the room , perhaps you exaggerate the evil . good morning , madame , said the count , bowing .: 42.86
<S> the men are all infamous , and i am happy to be able now to do more than detest them i despise them . what shall we do ? asked louise .: 38.03

<S> my dear friend , general cromwell has sent monsieur mordaunt to fetch me .: 36.48

<S> he is alone , said grimaud .: 13.19

<S> in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that , do you remember the road to crevecoeur , mousqueton ? ah , sir !: 53.18

<S> it is the work of another age , constructed by the genii of earth and water . how so ? at what period can that have been ? i do not know ; i have only heard that an emperor of china had an oven built expressly , and that in this oven twelve jars like this were successively baked .: 72.50
<S> she therefore took leave of the abbess , and went to bed , softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of kitty had naturally brought to her thoughts .: 38.68

<S> and he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass .: 35.25
<S> morrel , you are going to destroy yourself ! indeed , count , said morrel , shuddering ; what has put this into your head ? i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself , continued the count , and here is proof of what i say ; and , approaching the desk , he removed the sheet of paper which morrel had placed over the letter he had begun , and took the latter in his hands .: 28.95

<S> i know an inn , little frequented , but of which the host is entirely devoted to me .: 47.87
<S> endeavor , then , to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of rome , florence , milan , and madrid ; it may be useful to you one of these days , whether you remain here or return to the east . the young girl raised her tearful eyes towards monte cristo as she said with touching earnestness , whether we return to the east , you mean to say , my lord , do you not ? my child , returned monte cristo you know full well that whenever we part , it will be no fault or wish of mine ; the tree forsakes not the flower the flower falls from the tree . my lord , replied hayde e , i never will leave you , for i am sure i could not exist without you . my poor girl , in ten years i shall be old , and you will be still young . my father had a long white beard , but i loved him ; he was sixty years old , but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths i saw . then tell me , hayde e , do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life ? shall i see you ? every day . then what do you fear , my lord ? you might find it dull . no , my lord .: 47.31
<S> her brother ? replied athos .: 26.04

<S> this was fulfilling the intentions of monsieur porthos , who had desired us to be so careful of this letter , was it not ? nearly so . well , monsieur , do you know who this great lady is ? no ; i have heard porthos speak of her , that s all . do you know who this pretended duchess is ?: 38.21
<S> the heart of the best woman is pitiless toward the sorrows of a rival .: 55.75
<S> now , thinking that her host was a priest , that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age , among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed , if she could win that of having damned an abbe . count , said the duchess , upon my word , you frighten me . alas ! continued athos , the poor abbe was not a st. ambroise , and i repeat , marie michon was an adorable creature . monsieur ! cried the duchess , seizing athos s hands , tell me this moment how you know all these details , or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you . athos laughed .: 56.09
<S> he walked six or seven times round the place royale , turning at every ten steps to look at the light in milady s apartment , which was to be seen through the blinds .: 39.19
<S> they descended to the first floor ; albert led his guest into the salon .: 45.04
<S> la jeune ame lie was first at the rendezvous .: 26.27
<S> undoubtedly , madame , said d artagnan , taking the document and bowing , this is a noble reward ; but everything in the world is unstable , and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow . what more do you want ? asked the queen , coloring , as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own .: 39.83
<S> d artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal ; this was his second interview with richelieu , and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last .: 41.49
<S> do not refuse this little service .: 46.25
<S> he took cucumetto one side , while the young girl , seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest , made a veil of her picturesque head dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits .: 34.12
<S> in my turn i uttered a cry , but a cry of joy .: 16.94
<S> then , compelled to quit rome , he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish , scarcely noticed in history .: 133.27
<S> now , said d artagnan , you wouldn t be sorry to understand the plot , would you , porthos ? well , no , not very . well , then , we shall go down into the court . yes . we shall take the place of those two fellows . well ? we will walk back and forth . that s a good idea , for it isn t warm . in a moment the valet de chambre will call the guard , as he did yesterday and the day before . and we shall answer ? no , on the contrary , we shall not answer . as you please ; i don t insist on answering . we will not answer , then ; we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his eminence . where shall we escort him ? where he is going to visit athos .: 33.06
<S> having accomplished these three social duties , monte cristo stopped , looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class , which seems to say , i have done my duty , now let others do theirs . andrea , who was in an adjoining room , had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of monte cristo , and now came forward to pay his respects to the count .: 41.09
<S> the count of monte cristo acts dishonorably to m. de morcerf , and is justified by his son !: 25.42
<S> the devil !: 10.10
<S> the cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissary for he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman , sometimes a serpent , sometimes a lion .: 58.55
<S> ah , monsieur , said planchet , i saw one fall at each of his two shots , and he appeared to me , through the glass door , to be fighting with his sword with the others . brave athos ! murmured d artagnan , and to think that we are compelled to leave him ; maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence .: 39.23
<S> all the nobility of rome will be present , and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society , she must go there . whether she goes there or not , my opinion is still the same , returned albert .: 52.75
<S> the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the cha teau d if ; dante s , nevertheless , determined to make for them .: 22.03
<S> a boat ! two ! three ! murmured my , father ; four ! he then arose , seizing his arms and priming his pistols .: 74.10
<S> everything was conducted in the usual manner .: 37.16
<S> why is she not come ? asked the prince in a low voice , addressing his brother .: 22.61
<S> when this formality was ended , as her duties called her to chapel , she left the two young women alone .: 57.90
<S> directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily , and , like a poor silly thing , i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name , that i was not surprised to see my father start , and almost tremble ; but i even thought though that surely must have been a mistake that m. danglars trembled too . morrel , morrel , cried my father , stop a bit ; then knitting his brows into a deep frown , he added , surely this can not be one of the morrel family who lived at marseilles , and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartism i mean about the year 1815. yes , replied m. danglars , i believe he is the son of the old shipowner . indeed , answered maximilian ; and what did your father say then , valentine ? oh , such a dreadful thing , that i don t dare to tell you . always tell me everything , said maximilian with a smile .: 59.00
<S> without doubt , she murmured .: 22.95
<S> the nubian smiled assentingly to his master s words , then , kneeling on one knee , respectfully kissed the hand of the count .: 37.38
<S> i beg you will remove your bandage . it may be supposed , then , franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission , but took off the handkerchief , and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty eight to forty years of age , dressed in a tunisian costume , that is to say , a red cap with a long blue silk tassel , a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold , pantaloons of deep red , large and full gaiters of the same color , embroidered with gold like the vest , and yellow slippers ; he had a splendid cashmere round his waist , and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle .: 45.06
<S> four young men of the richest and noblest families of rome accompanied them with that italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the world .: 51.02
<S> he then turned to the left , down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends , but as he opened the door he paused , as if in thought .: 24.86
<S> a tent was erected for them near that of the marshal .: 79.56
<S> have you , then , power against death ?: 45.38
<S> sir , resumed villefort , we are thinking of marrying valentine . had the old man s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there .: 78.46
<S> mazarin , who was sitting at a table folding up papers , as if he had only been a secretary of state , looked up .: 43.52
<S> an officer , as he spoke , entered the apartment .: 19.62
<S> well , this is what you have to say , said d artagnan : my lord , your sister in law is an infamous woman , who wished to have you killed that she might inherit your wealth ; but she could not marry your brother , being already married in france , and having been d artagnan stopped , as if seeking for the word , and looked at athos .: 28.88
<S> you see , i , who never did a bad action but that i have told you of am in destitution , with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes , and i unable to do anything in the world for her ; i shall die of hunger , as old dante s did , while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth . how is that ? because their deeds have brought them good fortune , while honest men have been reduced to misery . what has become of danglars , the instigator , and therefore the most guilty ? what has become of him ?: 66.23
<S> who ? asked his eminence .: 23.25
<S> the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene .: 76.52
<S> the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes , but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin , and their red caps , which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal ?: 60.71
<S> what !: 14.83
<S> i was hidden behind that door , he said , which leads into the next house , which i have rented . valentine turned her eyes away , and , with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear , exclaimed : sir , i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion , and that what you call protection is more like an insult . valentine , he answered , during my long watch over you , all i have observed has been what people visited you , what nourishment was prepared , and what beverage was served ; then , when the latter appeared dangerous to me , i entered , as i have now done , and substituted , in the place of the poison , a healthful draught ; which , instead of producing the death intended , caused life to circulate in your veins . poison death ! exclaimed valentine , half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination ; what are you saying , sir ? 50071m hush , my child , said monte cristo , again placing his finger upon her lips , i did say poison and death .: 57.73
<S> the same day he told his wife , emmanuel , and his daughter all that had occurred ; and a ray of hope , if not of tranquillity , returned to the family .: 37.40
<S> well , then , speak ! that which i have to say of her can only be heard by yourself , my lord ! leave us , patrick , said buckingham ; but remain within sound of the bell .: 39.14
<S> now , said monte cristo , that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement , prepare yourself , my dear m. cavalcanti , to meet your lost andrea . saying which monte cristo bowed , and disappeared behind the tapestry , leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count .: 60.97
<S> bazin was making , with his spare little short arms , ridiculous gestures .: 148.87
<S> total . . . . 114 frs .: 1176.56
<S> the island was deserted , and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance ; afar off , a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean .: 41.74
<S> as a friend , and only as a friend , at this moment .: 28.62
<S> you will not believe in him , who requires but a prayer , a word , a tear , and he will forgive ?: 50.42
<S> at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and d artagnan turned to him .: 21.66
<S> terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry .: 38.37
<S> you are inclining toward false doctrines , my young friend ; you will be lost . you will be lost , said the curate , shaking his head sorrowfully .: 27.07
<S> he found his carriage at the door , and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp , who was in his office .: 30.25
<S> baron danglars . follow me , said the man .: 27.19
<S> porthos , who could never see anything that was not self evident , talked to him as usual .: 54.79
<S> felton gently repulsed milady , and she sank into a chair .: 31.25
<S> lucien had found time , preparatory to the count s arrival , to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars .: 53.97
<S> the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation .: 8.83
<S> we have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friend s chateau and there we have come to an understanding .: 71.22
<S> the citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime . and you do you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois ? yes , they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body . how miserable not to be free ! don t be downcast .: 41.28
<S> you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg works .: 21.56
<S> can it be otherwise ?: 43.12
<S> aramis rushed to the hotel de ville , where madame de longueville was sojourning .: 22.45
<S> have you the wick ? asked the one who carried the lantern .: 31.93
<S> in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it .: 51.77
<S> the hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier , wrapped in a brown cloak , with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes .: 26.05
<S> i shall see you through the window as you mount your horse ; i shall follow you with my eyes as long as you are in sight ; then i shall place myself at the cardinal s door a door with glass windows .: 41.26
<S> certainly ; his panegyric has been uttered . they parted , laughing , she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest , he looking after her with eyes of love .: 85.49
<S> i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar , but he is sincere , and as rich as a gold mine , consequently , he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him , and i have promised to adhere to his instructions .: 58.13
<S> oh , bid him enter ! and the queen advanced to meet the messenger , whose hand she seized affectionately , whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her , contained in a case of gold .: 54.45
<S> i assure you , cried danglars , with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man , i solemnly declare to you , that i should never have thought of writing to yanina , did i know anything of ali pasha s misfortunes . who , then , urged you to write ?: 50.32
<S> good day , dear d artagnan , said aramis ; believe me , i am glad to see you . so am i delighted to see you , said d artagnan , although i am not yet sure that it is aramis i am speaking to . to himself , my friend , to himself !: 21.46
<S> for more than a month past , the mischievous child , who knew not what to wish for , had taken it into his head to have a monkey .: 50.75
<S> i have told you of her attempts to propitiate m. de villefort , her devotion to the elder dante s .: 27.98
<S> i have only to say , after the little that i have seen and heard , that i think even better of you than i have been told . raoul bowed .: 31.65
<S> precisely , madame , replied monte cristo ; but i perceive i have not much to teach you .: 22.03
<S> but , my dear count , has m. danglars any reason ? ah !: 26.05
<S> the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise , and , moreover , returned look for look , not even taking his eyes off him .: 65.45
<S> he saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to him .: 60.47
<S> they immediately all three halted , closed in , and waited , occupying the middle of the road .: 49.32
<S> in the first place , count , this youth is our prisoner ; you seem to forget that .: 34.72
<S> he saw that these tracks tended toward the wall ; on the other side he found similar tracks , then footprints of horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of enghien .: 62.54
<S> i have come , therefore , express from rome , to ask you for information . sir , replied the mayor .: 25.36
<S> and you , porthos ? i agree to it , too , said porthos , if d artagnan approves of it .: 24.44
<S> m. de tre ville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news .: 29.20
<S> i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you , there is another , perhaps , still greater . can it be possible ? murmured villefort , clasping his hands .: 37.67
<S> tis not for me , a private individual , to disunite a queen from her kingdom .: 54.17
<S> oh ! cried porthos , do you think so ? you are exaggerating , athos ; we are not so far gone as that , replied the lieutenant .: 22.34
<S> their vows were sacred and irrevocable .: 79.81
<S> standing well at court , whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch , whether the government was doctrinaire liberal , or conservative ; looked upon by all as a man of talent , since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded ; hated by many , but warmly supported by others , without being really liked by anybody , m. de villefort held a high position in the magistracy , and maintained his eminence like a harlay or a mole .: 130.31
<S> well , said he , do you still doubt ? oh , murmured the young girl .: 12.84
<S> and i , who have sworn to take him dead or alive , i am dishonored and by you ! kill me ! replied athos , uncovering his breast , if your honor requires my death . oh !: 47.95
<S> come , said d artagnan , after a conference of five minutes duration , let us begin our journey . where are we to go ? asked porthos .: 15.43
<S> useless to look ; everything will come to us when wanted .: 141.38
<S> i have brought away ten or twelve wounded .: 64.78
<S> alas , yes ! said caderousse very uneasily .: 19.26
<S> the trial at eight o clock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamp s door .: 16.07
<S> it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy , they would like him all the better for it ; but that athos , on the contrary , would despise him .: 35.84
<S> as soon as lord de winter saw buckingham was dead , he ran to felton , whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace .: 32.29
<S> let us go to monsieur de beaufort . the two friends went to the hotel de vendome .: 8.77
<S> ah ! said porthos , opening his eyes at that last word .: 17.88
<S> she did not please ; she intoxicated .: 59.66
<S> an old man , decorated with the cross of saint louis , now rose and proposed the health of king louis xviii .: 47.08
<S> he wore a mask . but you , aramis , who were close to him ? i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask . then it must be a man of a certain age . oh ! said d artagnan , that matters little .: 40.18
<S> you said , only imagine , and then paused .: 75.91
<S> around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped ; his energetic mind slumbered , as the body does after extreme fatigue .: 128.71
<S> listen , he said ; at the end of yonder corridor is a door , of which i have the key , it leads into the park .: 23.27
<S> this way !: 50.69
<S> in one hand she held her handkerchief , with which she appeared to be wiping her face , and in the other a bottle of english smelling salts .: 31.73
<S> no , said villefort ; only return again at eleven o clock ; at twelve the the oh , heavens , my poor , poor child ! and the procureur again becoming a man , lifted up his eyes and groaned .: 43.31
<S> i am going to fire ! gentlemen , exclaimed d artagnan , whom reflection never abandoned , gentlemen , think of what you are about .: 43.58
<S> he is a cardinal likewise .: 28.75
<S> you would follow the escort ? exclaimed porthos , in dismay .: 49.88
<S> he saw as though in a mist , a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery .: 48.51
<S> you , who speak english like john bull himself , are master tom lowe , we , your three companions .: 221.24
<S> porthos wept ; aramis pointed toward heaven ; athos made the sign of the cross .: 65.83
<S> do you think he died a natural death ? a sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of noirtier .: 45.81
<S> he was quite alone ; on one side was the vast wilderness of the saint lazare , on the other , paris enshrouded in darkness .: 58.08
<S> my ship is ready , and had you not come i must have set off without you , for general cromwell expects my return impatiently . so ! thought the lieutenant , tis to general cromwell that our dispatches are addressed . have you no letter for him ? asked the young man .: 45.87
<S> m. danglars no longer had a daughter .: 39.05
<S> it is i who cherish no resentment . porthos didn t understand any too clearly ; but then we know that understanding was not his strong point .: 105.09
<S> porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel .: 28.75
<S> with forty five thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years , and comfortably for four ; but before six months you with your music , and i with my voice we shall double our capital .: 99.61
<S> you see , m. morrel , said he , we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape boyador , sailing with a fair breeze , south south west after a week s calm , when captain gaumard comes up to me i was at the helm i should tell you and says , penelon , what do you think of those clouds coming up over there ? i was just then looking at them myself .: 86.01
<S> you understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named , he would not only lose his bet , but people would say he was afraid ; and a brave captain of spahis can not risk this , even to gratify a pretty woman , which is , in my opinion , one of the most sacred obligations in the world . you see my position , madame , said morrel , bestowing a grateful smile on monte cristo .: 43.44
<S> above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving ; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way , and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea bird .: 112.45
<S> yes , my lord , it is i. i have the honor to present to you monsieur du vallon , that excellent friend of mine , in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly . and d artagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos , who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking .: 40.72
<S> he was wrong to leave it there , but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him .: 26.87
<S> cloud sounded half past ten .: 70.43
<S> lord de winter placed him in the hands of the guards , who led him , while awaiting further orders , to a little terrace commanding the sea ; and then the baron hastened to the duke s chamber .: 32.29
<S> i knew the horse he rode ; it belonged to the butcher , who lets it out now and then to m. bazin .: 64.25
<S> aha ! cried d artagnan , they re coming toward us . so much the worse for them , said porthos .: 16.87
<S> am i to put this construction on your visit ? yes , if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny . wait a moment no threats , if you please , m. fernand mondego , vicomte de morcerf ; i never allow them from my enemies , and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends .: 61.69
<S> why should you meddle with what does not concern you ? the two men turned quickly , and saw the sickly countenance of la carconte peering between the baluster rails ; attracted by the sound of voices , she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs , and , seated on the lower step , head on knees , she had listened to the foregoing conversation .: 55.86
<S> madame danglars who , although past the first bloom of youth , was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano , a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work , while lucien debray , standing before a small work table , was turning over the pages of an album .: 96.99
<S> and besides , he said , going out of this chamber isn t all . dear friend , said porthos , you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to day than you were yesterday .: 25.24
<S> are you too proud to accept it , young gentleman ? no , sir , said d artagnan ; and i will guard it so carefully that i will be sworn it shall arrive at its address , and woe be to him who shall attempt to take it from me ! m. de tre ville smiled at this flourish ; and leaving his young man compatriot in the embrasure of the window , where they had talked together , he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised letter of recommendation .: 43.89
<S> athos !: 29.01
<S> one of them was made of debray , cha teau renaud , and beauchamp .: 21.60
<S> all four came up together .: 56.64
<S> is there any difficulty in the way ? no . replied the captain , but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port . what do you mean ? monte cristo although uninhabited , yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica , sardinia , and africa , and if it becomes known that we have been there , we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to leghorn . the deuce !: 53.19
<S> but , oh , how i passed that time !: 52.10
<S> he would not , however , yield immediately to the young man s request , but made a few conscientious objections .: 34.16
<S> mazarin , thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen , motioned them to follow him .: 50.51
<S> living , my best friends would avoid my house ; dead , all marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home .: 107.70
<S> it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to fall at every instant .: 46.60
<S> she therefore contented herself with saying that m. noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit , the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer .: 73.22
<S> he ran along the high road , took the path he had before taken , and reaching the ferry , interrogated the boatman .: 47.69
<S> he fixed his eyes on that window he distinguished a shadow in the darkness ; then one of the panes became quite opaque , as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside , then the square cracked without falling .: 49.29
<S> count , count , added she , you know that i wait for you . at this appeal d artagnan drew kitty quietly away , and slipped into the chamber .: 27.92
<S> the lackeys were sent to their several posts , except that grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway .: 52.59
<S> come in , cried athos .: 14.75
<S> and pray upon what shall i make my campaign ; upon grimaud ? i have brought you another , said d artagnan .: 52.90
<S> live , then , and be happy , beloved children of my heart , and never forget that until the day when god shall deign to reveal the future to man , all human wisdom is summed up in these two words , wait and hope . your friend , edmond dante s , count of monte cristo . 50282m during the perusal of this letter , which informed valentine for the first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother , she became pale , a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom , and tears , not the less painful because they were silent , ran down her cheeks ; her happiness cost her very dear .: 53.21
<S> come , come , said d artagnan , more reason why we should start on our journey .: 17.52
<S> do you think , then , that any harm can have happened to him ? asked aramis .: 11.25
<S> but he must be disturbed , cried the host ; here are two english gentlemen just arrived . well ? well , the english like good wine , as you may know , monsieur ; these have asked for the best .: 50.12
<S> oh , added a third voice , the shrouds of the cha teau d if are not dear ! 0257m perhaps , said one of the previous speakers , as he was a churchman , they may go to some expense in his behalf . they may give him the honors of the sack . edmond did not lose a word , but comprehended very little of what was said .: 41.97
<S> yes , i wish to speak to him . valentine durst not oppose her grandmother s wish , the cause of which she did not know , and an instant afterwards villefort entered .: 28.63
<S> well , what shall you do with this money , count ?: 18.52
<S> that deposit may be at any moment withdrawn , and if i had employed it for another purpose , i should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy .: 60.71
<S> merce de s , although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied , lost in the sphere she had now chosen , like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness , appeared like a queen , fallen from her palace to a hovel , and who , reduced to strict necessity , could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table , nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed .: 80.74
<S> ah , if i knew !: 22.88
<S> blaisois was in a state of great excitement ; he was in ecstasies .: 23.57
<S> are you hungry ? humiliating as such a confession is , i am .: 56.93
<S> come in , said louis xviii. , with repressed smile , come in , baron , and tell the duke all you know the latest news of m. de bonaparte ; do not conceal anything , however serious , let us see , the island of elba is a volcano , and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling war bella , horrida bella . m. dandre leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two hands , and said : has your majesty perused yesterday s report ? yes , yes ; but tell the duke himself , who can not find anything , what the report contains give him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in his islet . monsieur , said the baron to the duke , all the servants of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the island of elba .: 64.68
<S> but what cared i for delays or difficulties , valentine , as long as you confessed that you loved me , and took pity on me ?: 59.11
<S> i concluded that , by some singular chance , the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself ; but , as i entered my apartments , i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider .: 67.30
<S> the only question was , had she ten or twelve ?: 121.45
<S> oh , as to his name , i know nothing about it ; but if i were ever to meet him , i should recognize him in an instant , i will answer for it , were he among a thousand persons . the face of the commissary grew still darker .: 32.79
<S> it is not of my wife , i hope ! on the contrary , it is of her .: 19.12
<S> as you say , mazarin is a knave .: 28.51
<S> as to the poisoner , they had heard no tidings of her whatever , only that she must have made her escape through the garden , on the sand of which her footsteps could be traced , and the door of which had been found shut .: 37.42
<S> the absolution .: 89.05
<S> until now , it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining room , or under a long tent erected on the lawn , but the beautiful blue sky , studded with stars , had settled the question in favor of the lawn .: 61.26
<S> be satisfied , replied felton ; he will not sail . milady started with joy .: 24.11
<S> as he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this individual .: 31.06
<S> meantime , between charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead .: 86.39
<S> marechal de la meilleraie returning without a hat fontrailles with his arm in a sling wounded guards horses bleeding ; eh , then , what are the sentinels about ?: 200.14
<S> that voice also was known to grimaud .: 70.76
<S> he returned thus , formidable and implacable , advancing with his arms crossed on his breast , towards the general , who could not understand why he had disappeared , but who on seeing him again , and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him , drew back , and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand .: 57.57
<S> keep quiet while my master is being arrested !: 191.69
<S> d artagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk , for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform .: 79.06
<S> ah , said he , involuntarily following noirtier s eyes , which were fixed on madame de villefort , who repeated : this poor child would be better in bed .: 31.65
<S> oh , heaven forbid !: 23.32
<S> he opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth , to inhale better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him , and ended by a burst of laughter , so violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague .: 78.53
<S> we are going according to all probability to la rochelle , and once gone she will follow you to the end of the world , athos , if she recognizes you .: 35.20
<S> well , that is all that i wanted , and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are , said he , extending his hand to monte cristo .: 19.26
<S> that is what i want . come , if you will only put this scheme into execution , and be steady , nothing could be better . do you think so , m. bossuet ?: 40.65
<S> people might employ themselves in a family affair before all the world .: 84.23
<S> there , you see it will not take long . yes ; but do this , and you will have nectarines and all the rest . the shot told ; red with fever , while the large drops fell from his brow , the man executed , one after the other , the three signs given by the count , in spite of the frightful contortions of the right hand correspondent , who , not understanding the change , began to think the gardener had gone mad .: 47.44
<S> thank you , monseigneur , he said , drawing back ; i am paid . the duke went from one surprise to another .: 40.05
<S> he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know , and who had no reason to be devoted to him ; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt , and who had often examined his weapons , which were very beautiful , if not with envy , at least with curiosity .: 33.36
<S> mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and , with his hat in hand , prepared to pass by the two friends , motioning to the four men to follow him .: 21.63
<S> monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission , but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it ; and i made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness . thanks , my captain ! replied d artagnan , who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant general .: 38.40
<S> our game is beaten up .: 75.56
<S> d artagnan started .: 13.41
<S> morbleu ! my part is taken !: 61.57
<S> the tree was easy to climb .: 47.17
<S> yes , your excellency ; he came from marseilles , where he had been deputy procureur .: 25.27
<S> take them away , juxon ; their tears will deprive me of the courage to die . juxon led them away , and this time the doors were left open .: 66.52
<S> i hear , said aramis , but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain . i know not who can have uttered the cry , said the king , but the noise is easily understood .: 35.83
<S> ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room .: 50.99
<S> live the cardinal ! resounded on every side , and the drums were beaten in all directions .: 48.59
<S> let the queen remain in perfect security ; let her be ignorant that we know her secret .: 71.64
<S> i was wrong then , no , i said what you say there is a crisis at hand .: 50.55
<S> cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly ; but this mattered little to him now rita had been his ; and as for the money , three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it .: 78.39
<S> his fearless deportment , his words , so firm , yet dignified , the shades which by one word he had evoked , recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance , youth , beauty , the eclat of love at twenty years of age , the bloody death of buckingham , the only man whom she had ever really loved , and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of richelieu and the king .: 65.89
<S> to have to make a false excuse to porthos !: 71.17
<S> my faith , said d artagnan , it appears that i was more drunk than you , since i remember nothing of the kind . athos did not trust this reply , and he resumed ; you can not have failed to remark , my dear friend , that everyone has his particular kind of drunkenness , sad or gay .: 32.06
<S> but peppino did not answer .: 17.15
<S> is he at home ? yes , monsieur , said mousqueton , but in a very ill humor .: 15.65
<S> in contrast with the old man , who is dragging his way to the tomb , are two children just entering into life valentine , the daughter by my first wife mademoiselle rene e de saint me ran and edward , the boy whose life you have this day saved . and what is your deduction from this compensation , sir ? inquired monte cristo .: 63.99
<S> on the doorsteps d avrigny met the cousin whom villefort had mentioned , a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupied one of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others .: 83.01
<S> this smile appeared to d artagnan to be of bad augury .: 33.22
<S> you have a longboat ? that in which we came . it appeared light and well constructed . quite a canoe . fasten it to the poop with a rope ; put the oars into it , so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the cord .: 96.08
<S> my dear d herblay ! who can say whether d artagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal ?: 32.98
<S> the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men . what are your commands , lieutenant ? take the detachment and conduct him to his place . but you will be left alone ? certainly .: 38.36
<S> adieu , madame . in saying these words d artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved .: 35.17
<S> and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry , except as a last resort ? i promise on my honor . then , said the abbe , we may hope to put our design into execution . and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work ? at least a year . and shall we begin at once ? at once . we have lost a year to no purpose ! cried dante s .: 47.54
<S> i have the honor to inform your majesty , continued m. de tre ville , in the same tone , that a party of procureurs , commissaries , and men of the police very estimable people , but very inveterate , as it appears , against the uniform have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house , to lead away through the open street , and throw into fort l eve que , all upon an order which they have refused to show me , one of my , or rather your musketeers , sire , of irreproachable conduct , of an almost illustrious reputation , and whom your majesty knows favorably , monsieur athos . athos , said the king , mechanically ; yes , certainly i know that name . let your majesty remember , said tre ville , that monsieur athos is the musketeer who , in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with , had the misfortune to wound monsieur de cahusac so seriously .: 54.74
<S> he then arose .: 14.59
<S> it was easy to do so , and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea , everything favored my project .: 55.99
<S> my lord , added henrietta , with a melancholy smile , it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the louvre without money , without linen , almost without bread , and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire . horrible ! cried de winter ; the daughter of henry iv. , and the wife of king charles !: 64.96
<S> he was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith entered .: 46.30
<S> some further discovery will be made , which will bring this dreadful tragedy to a close .: 101.22
<S> but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed .: 33.96
<S> what has he to say ? inquired the young man who was in command in the chief s absence .: 21.46
<S> you know or you don t know , that that is what we ask of you . oh !: 28.33
<S> the beggar of st. eustache .: 30.69
<S> he had apparently given previous orders , for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coach house ready for him .: 62.04
<S> almost mad with grief , and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more , and be certain of the misfortune he feared , morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees , and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower garden , when the sound of a voice , still at some distance , but which was borne upon the wind , reached him .: 63.56
<S> tis true that he came the next morning to my house , thinking that he had to do with an abbe like all other abbe s. and what was the end of the affair ? we met in the place royale egad !: 48.93
<S> in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar , replied the staunch puritan .: 42.29
<S> at this , the delight of the mother was almost frantic .: 33.65
<S> for the moment she wished nothing better .: 49.93
<S> scarcely had a few seconds elapsed , ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight .: 35.91
<S> he fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink .: 46.20
<S> you know the calamity that has happened to us , do you not ? i know nothing . said m. d avrigny .: 14.63
<S> you would have been summoned to the gate ; you would have believed yourself about to meet friends ; you would have been abducted , and conducted back to paris . oh , my god !: 30.74
<S> ah , i shall know how to make you leave your home ! replied albert , clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove , which monte cristo did not lose sight of .: 33.91
<S> everything was in the same state .: 18.06
<S> what are you going to do this evening ? we intend to visit the abbe scarron , for whom i have a letter of introduction and at whose house i expect to meet some of my friends . tis well ; i will go there also , for a few minutes , said the duchess ; do not quit his salon until you have seen me . athos bowed and prepared to leave .: 35.26
<S> could you allow me a few words in private . what did i tell you ? said the governor .: 21.14
<S> thinking that i might wish to settle in france , he left me at his departure , together with the papers establishing my identity , a letter promising , if he approved of my choice , 150,000 livres per annum from the day i was married .: 71.15
<S> the abbe took it , and in return gave caderousse the diamond .: 80.39
<S> albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button hole , but he kept the faded one in his hand ; and when he again met the calash , he raised it to his lips , an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it , but her joyous companions also .: 65.25
<S> the tower of st. jacques de la boucherie .: 12.08
<S> god beholds your devotion and my martyrdom , and believe me , both will have their reward .: 94.79
<S> i was without a light in that room ; when the wind shook all the doors , behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed , i trembled .: 64.78
<S> the parliament !: 57.36
<S> skirmishing .: 209.72
<S> now , we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker , or our readers must have already perceived that d artagnan was not an ordinary man ; therefore , while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable , he did not make up his mind to die quietly , as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place .: 50.36
<S> aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol .: 30.00
<S> let us start , then ; we need no witnesses . very true , said monte cristo ; it is unnecessary , we know each other so well ! on the contrary , said the count , we know so little of each other . indeed ? said monte cristo , with the same indomitable coolness ; let us see .: 19.33
<S> but who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccoletto ? the gigantic bellows , the monstrous extinguishers , the superhuman fans .: 91.40
<S> he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence , since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor .: 60.74
<S> cocles opened the gate , and baptistin , springing from the box , inquired whether monsieur and madame herbault and monsieur maximilian morrel would see his excellency the count of monte cristo .: 52.57
<S> a bargain was therefore struck .: 73.07
<S> and i know i shall drown before reaching it , continued blaisois .: 52.37
<S> are you all here ? he asked .: 11.41
<S> the treasure i speak of really exists , and i offer to sign an agreement with you , in which i promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig ; and if i deceive you , bring me here again , i ask no more . the governor laughed .: 42.50
<S> there are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event ; it is to these powers we should rally . i am sorry for it , madame , but i acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom i have the honor to serve . you serve the cardinal ? yes , madame ; and as his servant , i will not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state , or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not french and who has a spanish heart .: 51.26
<S> look , you may see it from here at the foot of that little hill , that slated roof . very well , said the gentleman .: 39.71
<S> steel is for gentlemen . and seizing the butcher by the throat : porthos , said he , kill this fellow for me with a single blow . porthos raised his terrible fist , which whistled through the air like a sling , and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulter s skull and crushed it .: 81.65
<S> have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart ? yes , replied mme .: 23.62
<S> julie threw herself into the arms of the count ; emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel ; morrel again fell on his knees , and struck the ground with his forehead .: 37.74
<S> i hoped in silence .: 45.18
<S> when you are away , i no longer pray for myself , but for you . 30159m yes , since you have known me , said morrel , smiling ; but that can not apply to the time previous to our acquaintance , valentine . you are very provoking , and will not give me credit for anything ; but let me hear this second proof , which you yourself own to be absurd . well , look through this opening , and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here . ah !: 54.05
<S> the doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning , the subject has died of a tumor on the liver , or of typhoid fever ! but , remarked madame de villefort , all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident ; the vulture may not see the fowl , or may fall a hundred yards from the fish pond . ah , that is where the art comes in .: 81.65
<S> with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years . i only await one thing before following your advice ; that is , a minister who will hold office for six months .: 77.00
<S> have you brought your arms ? i ? what for ?: 46.28
<S> oh , yes , certainly , said the count ; uniform , cross , knee breeches . and how shall i be dressed ? demanded andrea .: 41.51
<S> ah , if i were but twenty years old ! yes , said athos , doubtless you would commit great follies !: 39.10
<S> why should not the king of france have the same chance as the emperor ? your eminence means , i presume , the knife stab in the rue de la feronnerie ? precisely , said the cardinal .: 51.64
<S> monsieur , continued she , turning to monte cristo , will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us ? believe me , madame , i feel most grateful for your kindness , but i got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning , and i am ignorant how i am installed in paris , which i scarcely know ; this is but a trifling inquietude , i know , but one that may be appreciated . we shall have the pleasure another time , said the countess ; you promise that ? monte cristo inclined himself without answering , but the gesture might pass for assent .: 34.46
<S> that is my answer . the answer was terrible .: 26.03
<S> in short , said d artagnan , this has been the will of god . it was not i who killed him , said athos in a soft , low tone , twas destiny . chapter lxiv .: 27.48
<S> art thou dangerously wounded , my dear mousqueton ? he said .: 42.29
<S> excuse curiosity , but i wish to be enlightened on the subject . because these prisoners , sir , are at my disposal and i choose to dispose of them as i like . allow me allow me , sir , said d artagnan , to observe you are in error .: 40.91
<S> in the long run , a man knows more about politics than a woman , particularly such as , like you , monsieur bonacieux , have conversed with the cardinal .: 51.21
<S> i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection , but there is a soul of iron in that delicate , fragile body .: 91.72
<S> where do you wish to be taken ? asked the president . anywhere out of your presence , replied m. d e pinay .: 21.54
<S> i hoped your house would have been some other one than this ; as if there was not another house at auteuil than that of the assassination ! what , what ! cried monte cristo , stopping suddenly , what words do you utter ?: 68.07
<S> then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it .: 77.28
<S> oh , said he , that is life to me ; more , more ! two drops more would kill you , replied the abbe .: 41.14
<S> coquenard filled her own plate , and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient clerks .: 127.16
<S> they saw no one , and the bastion seemed abandoned .: 37.19
<S> why do we love ?: 33.15
<S> no , said morrel ; i am not mistaken .: 9.92
<S> upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the duke s arms on it , and seemingly cooked to a turn , as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust .: 83.09
<S> around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette .: 160.28
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> she ran to the table , and seizing the knife which felton had laid down , exclaimed , and by what right will you prevent me from dying ? great god ! exclaimed felton , on seeing the knife glitter in her hand .: 41.91
<S> the innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty five years of age , tall , strong , and bony , a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes ; he had dark , sparkling , and deep set eyes , hooked nose , and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal ; his hair , like his beard , which he wore under his chin , was thick and curly , and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads .: 42.53
<S> the event was announced by the cessation of the firing .: 32.72
<S> such are for royalty , and we are simple commoners . speak not of crowns .: 166.22
<S> do you fancy because you have heard monsieur de tre ville speak to us a little cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us ?: 61.13
<S> leave the box , sir ! monte cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity .: 33.69
<S> oh , m. de villefort , i beseech your indulgence for him . villefort , as we have seen , belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles , morrel to the plebeian ; the first was a royalist , the other suspected of bonapartism .: 39.45
<S> what have i done , then ?: 10.06
<S> about this time , a band of brigands that had established itself in the lepini mountains began to be much spoken of .: 77.65
<S> outwardly and in the eyes of the world , i am surrounded by kindness and affection ; but the reverse is the case .: 39.34
<S> monte cristo quickly appreciated all that albert had collected here old cabinets , japanese porcelain , oriental stuffs , venetian glass , arms from all parts of the world everything was familiar to him ; and at the first glance he recognized their date , their country , and their origin .: 72.27
<S> at length she felt his heart beat , a faint breath played upon his lips , a slight shudder , announcing the return of life , passed through the young man s frame .: 32.86
<S> after walking for about ten minutes , during which danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide , he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds ; three men , standing silent , formed a triangle , of which he was the centre .: 34.42
<S> but m. de tre ville had always been so thoroughly his friend , had always been so devoted to the king and queen , and hated the cardinal so cordially , that the young man resolved to tell him everything .: 26.66
<S> no , madame , i will not thus waste your time .: 27.03
<S> well , on the day when your appointment as an officer of the legion of honor was announced in the papers , we were all sitting with my grandfather , m. noirtier ; m. danglars was there also you recollect m. danglars , do you not , maximilian , the banker , whose horses ran away with my stepmother and little brother , and very nearly killed them ?: 53.84
<S> here , laporte , said buckingham , these are the only tokens i ever received from her this silver casket and these two letters .: 69.78
<S> i will join you again at marseilles . well , be it so let us part , said merce de s , folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away , and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere .: 49.68
<S> but when the time came to pay for his rosemary , this oil , and the wine , the only expense the master had incurred , as he had preserved a strict abstinence while on the contrary , the yellow horse , by the account of the hostler at least , had eaten three times as much as a horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have done d artagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained ; for as to the letter addressed to m. de tre ville , it had disappeared .: 69.43
<S> now , said the baron , look at this woman .: 15.04
<S> yes , madame , replied the coadjutor ; i have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom . the queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced .: 41.58
<S> speak , said athos ; we can not see your signs .: 25.51
<S> to this preoccupation of his vanity , d artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish .: 65.28
<S> well , these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold .: 123.11
<S> well , that was a temptation for two wretches like you .: 52.55
<S> without losing sight of her for an instant , the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court , and blew it .: 25.31
<S> if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further , we shall find her , or rather , she will find us tomorrow ; then she will give me some sign or other , and i shall know what i have to do . on my word , said franz , you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses , and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind . albert was right ; the fair unknown had resolved , doubtless , to carry the intrigue no farther ; for although the young men made several more turns , they did not again see the calash , which had turned up one of the neighboring streets .: 62.30
<S> god save the king ! was the cry in every direction ; the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window , looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed ; at which the cries of the multitude were renewed .: 62.85
<S> we are carrying too much canvas .: 59.26
<S> and i am very glad you recognize me , dear m. caderousse ; it proves you have a good memory , for it must be about ten years since we last met . this calmness of busoni , combined with his irony and boldness , staggered caderousse .: 59.12
<S> the meeting chapter 91 .: 33.87
<S> the conversation took a cheerful turn .: 55.73
<S> the president is speaking to the king . stuart , bradshaw was saying , listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make . the king turned his head away , as if these words had not been intended for him .: 55.20
<S> the sign of the red dovecot chapter xliv .: 24.65
<S> those wretches wanted to take away my sword !: 108.54
<S> when a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished ; when one is a murderer , to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan . these words produced a contrary effect to that which mordaunt had anticipated .: 74.43
<S> good day to you ; have you slept well ? excellently , athos , but what are you looking for ?: 64.76
<S> ho ! said he , good advice , advice of a friend .: 38.74
<S> concerning a court intrigue in the meantime , the forty pistoles of king louis xiii. , like all other things of this world , after having had a beginning had an end , and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed .: 65.78
<S> his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey , and his lips , half opened , disclosed his white teeth , small and sharp like those of a jackal .: 77.05
<S> you have two unruly prisoners there , sir . unruly , comminges smiled ; you wish to terrify me , i suppose .: 55.68
<S> madame de morcerf did not lose sight of monte cristo ; she saw that he took nothing , and even noticed his gesture of refusal .: 31.80
<S> then the hand was withdrawn , leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring .: 54.79
<S> porthos had bicarat , and aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries .: 42.33
<S> may i beg of you , baroness , to honor me with an introduction to your daughter ? oh , you are no stranger at least not by name , replied madame danglars , and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you .: 40.84
<S> eh , rascal ! said d artagnan , do you not recognize his highness the prince s carriage ? prince or not , said the man , open .: 31.41
<S> what the devil do you want with a member of the parliament ?: 14.42
<S> but has one ever seen such a wild fellow , continued he , making himself a mazarinist and helping to arrest broussel !: 70.23
<S> my dear planchet , said d artagnan , sighing , we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me .: 45.69
<S> this reassured her .: 50.04
<S> a paper may be lost . you are right ; only let me know where to find you that i may not run needlessly about the neighborhood . that s correct ; wait ! do you want a map ? oh , i know this country marvelously ! you ?: 55.31
<S> but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced , his excellency the count of monte cristo . the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerf s narrative had impressed them , and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion .: 112.31
<S> please pay to my order , from the fund deposited by me , the sum of a million , and charge the same to my account .: 62.23
<S> during these hours of profound meditation , which to him had seemed only minutes , he had formed a fearful resolution , and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath .: 95.48
<S> ten curious heads were glued to the tapestry and became pale with fury ; for their ears , closely applied to the door , did not lose a syllable of what he said , while their mouths repeated as he went on , the insulting expressions of the captain to all the people in the antechamber .: 78.87
<S> the first act of franz was to summon his landlord , who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness .: 26.92
<S> help ! comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post ; but at that instant a treble voice , proceeding from a kind of entresol , was heard screeching : murder !: 87.64
<S> there is a servant active and vigilant , not like that lazy fellow bazin , who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church .: 78.12
<S> yes , yes , i see .: 11.63
<S> from the signs of respect the valet paid him , he saw that his note had produced a good effect .: 49.15
<S> do you come from the end of the world ? said monte cristo ; you , a journalist , the husband of renown ?: 24.12
<S> i will expose all . to whom ? to m. danglars . by heaven ! cried caderousse , drawing from his waistcoat an open knife , and striking the count in the breast , you shall disclose nothing , reverend sir ! to caderousse s great astonishment , the knife , instead of piercing the count s breast , flew back blunted .: 66.24
<S> all the same , resumed he , after having clicked his tongue against his palate , they are brave fellows !: 63.83
<S> seven of his eminence s guards placed hors de combat by you four in two days !: 153.63
<S> ah , you are quite the pet of the ladies , monsieur porthos ! resumed the procurator s wife , with a sigh .: 16.83
<S> except the knowledge of blazons , that enables me to decipher them , i am very ignorant of heraldry i , a count of a fresh creation , fabricated in tuscany by the aid of a commandery of st. stephen , and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary .: 54.42
<S> avenged yourself , said the baron .: 27.79
<S> then he went to see his mother , who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone , and had kept her room .: 30.89
<S> athos forced his way through and entered , followed by the young man .: 33.62
<S> your letter has frightened me , and i have come hither with all speed . julie , said madame morrel , making a sign to the young man , go and tell your father that maximilian has just arrived . the young lady rushed out of the apartment , but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand .: 23.43
<S> you forget , my dear , you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself .: 38.26
<S> in fact , i am dead .: 13.44
<S> we are almost there and i want no one to see me getting out of your carriage ; we are supposed not to know each other . you are right .: 35.68
<S> we were able to prove the contrary , and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty , calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the louvre , where your royal munificence has provided for her a home .: 88.16
<S> milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out .: 16.15
<S> the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos , who urged on his horse against one of them .: 75.16
<S> d avrigny and villefort laid him on a couch .: 33.97
<S> ah , yes , that is the name , certainly .: 14.97
<S> in this case , replied caderousse , let s have some more wine .: 58.36
<S> my son ! he exclaimed suddenly , where is my son ? edward , edward ! and he rushed out of the room , still crying , edward , edward ! the name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran up .: 28.43
<S> that night , then , was somewhat riotous , as may be imagined .: 42.23
<S> no , no , you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns , or for his majesty the emperor . i am a royalist , replied the general ; i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis xviii. , and i will adhere to it . these words were followed by a general murmur , and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness .: 40.46
<S> now , madame , said debray , you have a splendid fortune , an income of about 60,000 livres a year , which is enormous for a woman who can not keep an establishment here for a year , at least .: 31.32
<S> the gate once closed , and debray and the baroness alone in the court , he asked : what was the matter with you , hermine ?: 36.26
<S> yes , said athos , magnificent .: 13.47
<S> grimaud and blaisois are holding your horses , ready saddled . in that case , exclaimed athos , let us not lose an instant , but set off . come , added the king .: 25.32
<S> you see i am generous , am i not , mother ? but you , my poor child ? i ?: 27.16
<S> no .: 17.05
<S> you are somewhat blase i know , and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor , who has seen so many others .: 77.74
<S> the young men , impatient to learn the cause of the firing , spurred on toward the servants .: 36.45
<S> and so i came , added caderousse , as fast as i could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend . 0037m worthy caderousse ! said the old man , he is so much attached to us . yes , to be sure i am .: 32.90
<S> he hastened to open the secre taire , and found the pocket book in the drawer , and in it the letter of credit .: 45.35
<S> planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place , who was in search of a situation .: 36.02
<S> think of it , sire !: 22.87
<S> do not be angry , we can try it . caderousse went to the window , touched the glass with it , and found it would cut .: 29.43
<S> it is important that he should receive it before eleven o clock .: 17.59
<S> oh , sir !: 8.42
<S> no ; before a woman you would dare not fly , i presume ? remember , said milady , seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword , the least delay may ruin everything . you are right , cried the gentleman ; begone then , on your part , and i will depart as quickly on mine . and bowing to the lady , he sprang into his saddle , while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses .: 53.98
<S> porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger ; he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else . they continued their route .: 53.99
<S> get on ! the coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses ; the noble animals bounded forward ; then cries of men who were knocked down were heard ; then a double concussion was felt , and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body .: 99.05
<S> then you are going with me ? i will accompany you a portion of the way , said athos .: 16.38
<S> with the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of madame de saint me ran and the death of the marquis , that something would occur at m. de villefort s in connection with his attachment for valentine .: 44.19
<S> at last , charged with murders , with debauchery , hated by every one and yet threatening still , like a panther thirsting for blood , she fell under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate , though they had never done her the least injury ; she met with judges whom her hideous crimes had evoked ; and that executioner you saw that executioner who you say told you everything that executioner , if he told you everything , told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his brother s shame and suicide .: 133.29
<S> the minister bowed his head , and while a deep color overspread his cheeks , he stammered out : by the telegraph , sire . louis xviii .: 47.77
<S> as usual , valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers , but without gathering them .: 71.03
<S> and here is mr. mordaunt , who has brought it and is charged with its execution . mordaunt ! muttered the four friends , exchanging glances .: 59.11
<S> i will arm him against love . alas , madame ! exclaimed athos , to day love is like war the breastplate is becoming useless . raoul entered at this moment ; he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king , queen , and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing day .: 71.79
<S> the doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it ; he only satisfied himself by milady s pulse that the case was not serious .: 66.18
<S> i have nothing to do with these things why hold me responsible ? yes , said porthos .: 26.07
<S> just so , gentlemen !: 39.91
<S> athos went to pay a visit to madame de vendome , left his name at madame de chevreuse s and wrote the following letter to d artagnan : dear friend , i am about to set off with aramis on important business .: 34.53
<S> dante s dived again , and remained a long time beneath the water .: 31.86
<S> monte cristo took the glass , drank half its contents , and then presented it to valentine , who smiled and swallowed the rest .: 27.23
<S> this sleep , provincial as it was , brought him to nine o clock in the morning ; at which hour he rose , in order to repair to the residence of m. de tre ville , the third personage in the kingdom , in the paternal estimation .: 25.51
<S> the night monte cristo waited , according to his usual custom , until duprez had sung his famous suivez moi ! then he rose and went out .: 55.14
<S> oh , the women , the women ! cried the old soldier .: 19.80
<S> a man was introduced of simple mien , who had the appearance of a tradesman .: 41.76
<S> weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me , and the next instant a dull , heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase .: 107.38
<S> his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body .: 21.08
<S> all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him ; he could not foresee the consequences ; he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar .: 94.09
<S> porthos had found nothing , and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger .: 46.98
<S> at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared , and selim fell , pierced by five blows .: 95.52
<S> take pity on me , then , and go !: 24.35
<S> then he advanced to the door , and asked whether there were any rooms to be let .: 29.62
<S> yes , we will wait , replied valentine , who revived at these words ; there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are . i rely on you , valentine , said morrel ; all you do will be well done ; only if they disregard your prayers , if your father and madame de saint me ran insist that m. d e pinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract then you have my promise , maximilian . instead of signing i will go to you , and we will fly ; but from this moment until then , let us not tempt providence , let us not see each other .: 48.88
<S> i have been the cause of all your misfortunes ; but why do you pity , instead of blaming me ?: 29.78
<S> he is the most estimable , the most trustworthy creature in the world , and i will venture to say , there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service .: 34.37
<S> continue to seek for this man , sir , said the king to the minister of police ; for if , as i am all but convinced , general quesnel , who would have been so useful to us at this moment , has been murdered , his assassins , bonapartists or not , shall be cruelly punished . it required all villefort s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him .: 52.19
<S> for forty years , he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support .: 34.65
<S> here it is , said aramis , with a little look of diffidence , which , however , was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy : vous qui pleurez un passe plein de charmes , et qui trainez des jours infortune s , tous vos malheurs se verront termine s , quand a dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes , vous qui pleurez ! you who weep for pleasures fled , while dragging on a life of care , all your woes will melt in air , if to god your tears are shed , you who weep ! d artagnan and the curate appeared pleased .: 123.27
<S> under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows , he prudently turned away , and calmed himself immediately , daunted by the power of a resolute mind .: 122.12
<S> he never spoke of women .: 42.59
<S> at the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance .: 77.32
<S> mother nanette ! cried friquet , suffocating ; ah !: 50.33
<S> you know that the english laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage .: 56.73
<S> monte cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with m. de boville , who was standing in the waiting room , and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left .: 28.94
<S> the deliverance of the cardinal , perhaps .: 30.93
<S> my father is proud , sir , and if he had not a meal left , i doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone , except from heaven . well , then , after this first visit has been made we shall count on you . i must again excuse myself , m. morrel , for after this first visit has been paid i have another which i am most anxious to pay . true , dante s , i forgot that there was at the catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father the lovely merce de s. dante s blushed .: 52.99
<S> they brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows .: 40.22
<S> the minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination .: 80.93
<S> he will , indeed give us the favor of his company ; you will , i hope , be grateful for it ; porthos , do not lose sight of his eminence . aramis then joined athos and d artagnan , who were consulting together .: 36.15
<S> in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris , as he did the horses .: 80.91
<S> you have brought him to see me , thinking to make me happy .: 31.76
<S> in the first place , la rochelle appeared impregnable .: 22.84
<S> the true nobility laughed at him , the talented repelled him , and the honorable instinctively despised him .: 117.52
<S> they close it . what , then ? silence !: 61.20
<S> but that is not all , continued danglars ; he has opened an account with my house for his son . may i ask how much he allows the young man ? five thousand francs per month . sixty thousand francs per year .: 39.23
<S> i am ready .: 14.78
<S> no , sire , replied athos .: 8.02
<S> andrea read in a low voice : you are poor ; a miserable old age awaits you .: 47.18
<S> as for us , we were three days without anything to eat or drink , so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest , when we saw la gironde ; we made signals of distress , she perceived us , made for us , and took us all on board .: 79.17
<S> yonder is the house , porthos , said the gascon ; let me do what i please and do you what i do . they glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut , four fine horses .: 69.42
<S> i would as willingly accuse myself !: 81.49
<S> i told you villefort was ambitious , and to attain this ambition villefort would sacrifice everything , even his father . then , sire , may i present him ? this instant , duke !: 75.84
<S> he stopped , however , at the door for an instant .: 15.80
<S> but to dante s eye there was no darkness .: 39.75
<S> madame , he said , i am an abbe , it is true , but i am so against my will .: 16.51
<S> i know that i ought never to name the persons who answer my questions , answered the child , for if i do i shall learn nothing further . at this very moment mazarin entered .: 55.45
<S> i feigned a criminal process , and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her .: 120.95
<S> that m. danglars speculates , whereas he never does . truly , madame , i recollect m. debray told me apropos , what has become of him ?: 70.74
<S> oh , it s nothing , nothing ! cried milady .: 14.47
<S> it is said to have been a congestion of the brain , or apoplexy , which is the same thing , is it not ? nearly . it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy , said beauchamp .: 25.64
<S> enough , enough ! replied caderousse ; say no more about it ; i will take all the consequences upon myself . and he began his story .: 43.74
<S> monsieur de belliere , said he to one of them , do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man , mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private stair , and wait for me there ; it is an affair of importance on the service of the king . the musketeer , who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service , obeyed without a word , although he thought the order strange .: 37.33
<S> i had him so well at the point of my gun i should have sent a ball into his breast . it is enough to have killed the mother , said athos , hoarsely .: 30.58
<S> now then , go , go , in the name of heaven !: 17.61
<S> i beseech you . the superior and mme .: 36.27
<S> about a hundred paces from the palais royal a patrol stopped the carriage .: 24.98
<S> egad !: 25.42
<S> the musketeers rode the whole length of the faubourg saint antoine and of the road to vincennes , and soon found themselves out of the town , then in a forest and then within sight of a village .: 37.52
<S> i !: 24.10
<S> if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements , aramis , those of london are mine .: 75.81
<S> it might be expected that the attack , if indeed an attack was projected , would be made from the staircase of the ground floor , and not from a window ; in monte cristo s opinion , the villains sought his life , not his money .: 64.74
<S> they fear the ear that hears their orders , and the eye that scrutinizes their actions .: 74.21
<S> ah , monsieur bonacieux , i never did love you much , but now it is worse than ever .: 27.97
<S> will he be at home at eight o clock this evening ? doubtless , unless he is at work , which is the same as if he were out . i will come again at that time , replied the visitor , who then retired .: 29.18
<S> now , then , said villefort , placing the letter in his pocketbook , i must have another ! to whom ? to the king . to the king ? yes . i dare not write to his majesty . i do not ask you to write to his majesty , but ask m. de salvieux to do so .: 22.83
<S> the sentence is passed , and , in a few hours , will be executed ; it must be so , and i will not endeavor to prevent it .: 22.38
<S> bonacieux would never have left that embrace alive .: 107.97
<S> the ass !: 27.79
<S> one of marie michon s adventures .: 32.27
<S> cries were heard from the camp , come down !: 73.30
<S> the abbe smiled .: 14.13
<S> you are a provident person , i see . why , you see , no one knows what may happen .: 29.68
<S> the gate of the enclosure was shut ; but he leaped over the hedge , and in spite of the barking of a chained up dog , went up to the cabin .: 34.91
<S> but i do not see the count of monte cristo here . he is worn out , said debray ; besides , he could not well appear in public , since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti , who , it appears , presented themselves to him with false letters of credit , and cheated him out of 100,000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality . by the way , m. de cha teau renaud , asked beauchamp , how is morrel ? ma foi , i have called three times without once seeing him .: 35.35
<S> then he drew from his waistcoat pocket the little emerald box , raised the golden lid , and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea , which he placed in her hand .: 36.35
<S> he wore a vest of garnet colored velvet , with buttons of cut gold ; a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery ; a roman scarf tied round his neck ; a cartridge box worked with gold , and red and green silk ; sky blue velvet breeches , fastened above the knee with diamond buckles ; garters of deerskin , worked with a thousand arabesques , and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors ; two watches hung from his girdle , and a splendid poniard was in his belt .: 87.25
<S> i rely on your friendship to assist me , beauchamp , if contempt has not banished it from your heart . contempt , my friend ?: 73.04
<S> it is a chain of recollections an idea which carries you back to other times , to other places which , very likely , have no connection with the present time and place .: 83.44
<S> she will try to seduce you , perhaps she will try to kill you .: 33.86
<S> yes , sir , replied mousqueton .: 6.96
<S> morrel advanced with a firm , manly tread , and poor barrois followed him as he best might .: 95.88
<S> i never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances .: 87.54
<S> still you must breakfast somewhere . but if i am not hungry ? said the young man .: 28.92
<S> i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it , said the unknown with a singular smile ; and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season . although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness , his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity .: 76.86
<S> the more profoundly she wounded his heart , the more certainly he would avenge her .: 72.47
<S> in every country where independence has taken the place of liberty , the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon , which at once renders him capable of defence or attack , and , by rendering its owner terrible , often makes him feared .: 85.49
<S> he was yielding to your infernal influence ; but i will save him .: 54.58
<S> i was at school at the time , and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king . which would not prevent me , said d artagnan , if i knew where the duke of buckingham was , from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen , were it only to enrage the cardinal , and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn , i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing it . and did the mercer , rejoined athos , tell you , d artagnan , that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter ? haberdasher she is afraid so . wait a minute , then , said aramis .: 44.11
<S> but you is there nothing that you want ? we came here with the intention of asking for something to eat . alas , they have taken everything ; there isn t a morsel of bread in the house . you hear , d artagnan ? said athos ; we shall have to look elsewhere for our dinner . it is all one to me now , said d artagnan ; i am no longer hungry . faith !: 39.83
<S> how very astonishing ! cried he at length .: 29.66
<S> i desire but one thing in this world , edmond , the happiness of my son . pray to the almighty to spare his life , and i will take upon myself to promote his happiness . thank you , edmond . but have you no request to make for yourself , merce de s ? for myself i want nothing .: 35.14
<S> neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it .: 104.92
<S> adieu . adieu , your holiness , said the mendicant , opening the door and bending low before the prelate .: 42.28
<S> the dappled grays volume three chapter 48 .: 84.01
<S> there was no response .: 16.84
<S> i positively refuse ; intrigues terrify me .: 172.35
<S> a few soldiers , commanded by a sergeant , drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse .: 33.62
<S> the bastion st. gervais , replied d artagnan , from behind which the rochellais annoyed our workmen . was that affair hot ? yes , moderately so .: 115.89
<S> have you , sir , asked he , a letter accrediting you to me ? there it is , my lord , said the young man .: 15.65
<S> yes , replied albert , raising his voice .: 9.23
<S> but what did m. danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur ? oh , he laughed , and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself half malicious , half ferocious ; he almost immediately got up and took his leave ; then , for the first time , i observed the agitation of my grandfather , and i must tell you , maximilian , that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame .: 44.00
<S> felton , said buckingham , you will withdraw , and place yourself at once under arrest . you will hear me to the end , my lord .: 40.11
<S> ah , ah !: 8.65
<S> there , do you hear ? observed gaetano ; he is bidding you adieu . the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air , but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore .: 39.69
<S> furnished with this plunder , andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window , intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes .: 48.85
<S> the soldier went out , leaving the dinner served .: 38.08
<S> at ten minutes to eight beauchamp arrived ; he had seen cha teau renaud , who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised .: 35.69
<S> you will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his sovereign . where is the treaty ? here it is . anne of austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that d artagnan presented to her .: 41.36
<S> a short time since i passed through marseilles , and went to see the old place , which revived so many painful recollections ; and in the evening i took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where i had concealed my treasure .: 36.84
<S> in one hour after , the ordinance was published in london that no vessel bound for france should leave port , not even the packet boat with letters .: 141.41
<S> a lamp , placed at the base of a pillar , lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow .: 42.12
<S> d artagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued , but athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber , conducted thither by raoul .: 45.25
<S> come , vicomte , he said , it is time for you to go to bed ; you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince .: 18.62
<S> give me my felt hat , bernouin . the valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim .: 112.39
<S> aramis , you certainly are full of wisdom ! the young men burst into a laugh , and as may be supposed , the affair had no other sequel .: 54.58
<S> all his funds amounted to 6,000 or 8,000 francs , his bills receivable up to the 5th to 4,000 or 5,000 , which , making the best of everything , gave him 14,000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287,500 francs .: 123.41
<S> morrel , said he , do not forget what you have just seen . the only chance for albert s safety , then , will arise from your emotion . i suffer from emotion ? said monte cristo .: 43.75
<S> sure of what ? that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself . what lord ruthven do you mean ? why , our lord ruthven the vampire of the salle argentina ! is it possible ? exclaimed the countess ; is he here in paris ? to be sure , why not ? and you visit him ? meet him at your own house and elsewhere ? i assure you he is my most intimate friend , and m. de cha teau renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance . but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize ? was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa ? what of that ? why , do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner ? oh , yes . and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner ? to be sure , i remember it all now . he called himself vampa .: 44.02
<S> again , the moderate fortune which athos possessed , concealed as it was , so skillfully , seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused .: 134.07
<S> i have then about fifty pistoles .: 43.80
<S> when the emperor returned from the island of elba , my brother instantly joined the army , was slightly wounded at waterloo , and retired with the army beyond the loire . but that is the history of the hundred days , m. bertuccio , said the count ; unless i am mistaken , it has been already written . excuse me , excellency , but these details are necessary , and you promised to be patient . go on ; i will keep my word . one day we received a letter .: 37.74
<S> you ll see that that queer fellow will be a sheriff before i shall be a captain . come , dear d artagnan , look up a little !: 41.65
<S> no one knows what there is . and where is it ? on the first floor . sketch me the plan of that floor , as you have done of the ground floor , my boy . that is very simple . andrea took the pen .: 26.61
<S> although d artagnan did not at all know the queen , he soon distinguished her voice from the others , at first by a slightly foreign accent , and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words .: 91.74
<S> the young king approached his mother and said , why do as these people ask ? it must be so , my son , said anne of austria .: 35.74
<S> you are good and faithful servants . athos sprang from his horse , gave the bridle to grimaud , and advanced toward the window , after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door .: 19.83
<S> i see you require proofs .: 40.39
<S> his head , supported by a long and flexible neck , issued from his large black robe , balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell .: 49.52
<S> has she left armentie res ? grimaud made a sign in the affirmative .: 21.63
<S> do you know that ? he asked .: 7.86
<S> athos wished to restrain him , but it was too late .: 12.03
<S> if , when you have seen me again , you still persist well , then you shall be free , and i myself will give you the weapon you desire . well , said milady , for you i will wait . swear . i swear it , by our god .: 32.26
<S> but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwell s .: 75.41
<S> well , before you leave , tell him all ; his consent would be your justification in god s sight .: 71.90
<S> come , gentlemen , your swords , said the duke .: 12.40
<S> porthos did not feel the ridicule of this , and took it for a piece of simplicity , at which he laughed in his large mustache .: 42.27
<S> you are mistaken i am not the count of monte cristo . then who are you ? 50261m i am he whom you sold and dishonored i am he whose betrothed you prostituted i am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise yourself to fortune i am he whose father you condemned to die of hunger i am he whom you also condemned to starvation , and who yet forgives you , because he hopes to be forgiven i am edmond dante s ! danglars uttered a cry , and fell prostrate .: 78.42
<S> and would you still cane me if i took it into my head to disobey you ?: 65.48
<S> he is here . who ? milady s son . athos , again struck by this name , which seemed to pursue him like an echo , hesitated for a moment , then slightly knitting his brows , he calmly said : i know it , grimaud met him between bethune and arras and then came here to warn me of his presence . does grimaud know him , then ? no ; but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him . the headsman of bethune ? exclaimed de winter .: 46.21
<S> accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me , and which i intend following .: 66.86
<S> well , captain , he endeavored twice to get up , and fell again twice .: 48.85
<S> the son has been educated in a college in the south ; i believe near marseilles .: 57.43
<S> well , it is the same with hashish ; only eat for a week , and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor , which now appears to you flat and distasteful .: 61.57
<S> well , answered the old man , by closing his eyes ; but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness .: 33.52
<S> some carried arms , others seemed to be taking aim , and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in hand .: 90.29
<S> were you stopped ? eagerly inquired the two youths .: 88.05
<S> say that i am permitted to walk in those woods .: 58.88
<S> they would have found they have not found ; but they are on the track . yes , that the usual phrase ; i am quite familiar with it .: 50.74
<S> feverish and excited , i rang at the door .: 38.87
<S> porthos seized his opportunity , caught the next soldier by his neck , gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room , and entered after him .: 58.27
<S> science becomes , in their hands , not only a defensive weapon , but still more frequently an offensive one ; the one serves against all their physical sufferings , the other against all their enemies .: 109.78
<S> after having well beaten him , he forbade him to leave his service without his permission .: 41.92
<S> i understand , said morrel ; i am to wait . yes . but delay may ruin our plan , sir , replied the young man .: 26.97
<S> but at the street gate , porthos was talking with the soldier on guard .: 57.77
<S> this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess , who are still as much united , although married more than twenty years , as on the first day of their wedding . 20261m monte cristo glanced rapidly at albert , as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words , but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart .: 39.51
<S> at this moment emmanuel entered , his countenance full of animation and joy .: 36.19
<S> immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it .: 42.77
<S> besides , you will always have your charms left to seduce them with .: 74.37
<S> the leghorn barber said nothing and went to work .: 140.10
<S> you will be very kind to me , will you not , morrel , to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus ?: 28.18
<S> mark well what i say .: 138.75
<S> he will be furious ; but i don t care .: 27.42
<S> there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy .: 118.91
<S> the two lower rooms consisted of a dining room , with a table , chairs , and side board of walnut , and a wainscoted parlor , without ornaments , carpet , or timepiece .: 47.95
<S> and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o clock , an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests , consisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon , and other personal friends of the bridegroom , the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes , in order to do greater honor to the occasion .: 62.11
<S> you have suffered a great deal , sir ? said franz inquiringly .: 17.98
<S> 9 money and sanctity , each in a moiety . 10 elisabeth de rossan , marquise de ganges , was one of the famous women of the court of louis xiv .: 69.42
<S> that cousin of aramis , that marie michon , that needlewoman , notwithstanding her low condition , had acquaintances in the highest rank ; she called the grandest ladies of the court her friend , and the queen proud as she is , in her double character as austrian and as spaniard called her her sister . alas ! said madame de chevreuse , with a slight sigh and a little movement of her eyebrows that was peculiarly her own , since that time everything has changed . and the queen had reason for her affection , for marie was devoted to her devoted to that degree that she served her as medium of intercourse with her brother , the king of spain . which , interrupted the duchess , is now brought up against her as a great crime . and therefore , continued athos , the cardinal the true cardinal , the other one determined one fine morning to arrest poor marie michon and send her to the chateau de loches .: 84.70
<S> if the studs are not yet gone to paris , they will not arrive till after you . how so ? i have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his majesty s ports , and without particular permission , not one dare lift an anchor . d artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues .: 54.58
<S> call mr. felton , said he .: 43.92
<S> will your majesty deign to excuse me ? speak , sir , speak boldly , replied louis .: 37.26
<S> they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier .: 80.00
<S> noirtier , paler than even the young girl , more eager than villefort for the decision , was watching also intently and affectionately .: 75.13
<S> my lord , said comminges , who , irritated by his wounds , wished for revenge and longed to give back blow for blow , shall i fire off a ball to punish that jester , and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future ? and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncle s saddle bow .: 84.74
<S> is he living ? patience , monseigneur , we are coming to it .: 40.15
<S> porthos , completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback , retired to his cabin and went to sleep .: 73.95
<S> that emetic , villefort see if it is coming . villefort sprang into the passage , exclaiming , the emetic !: 78.52
<S> do not open the pie till you are alone .: 44.94
<S> charles , without replying a single word , turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it .: 45.42
<S> but he has wealth , i believe , already . doubtless he has .: 71.38
<S> impossible ! said cha teau renaud ; only ten days after the flight of her daughter , and three days from the bankruptcy of her husband ? debray colored slightly , and followed with his eyes the direction of beauchamp s glance .: 38.53
<S> see and she exposed her face completely to view see , misfortune has silvered my hair , my eyes have shed so many tears that they are encircled by a rim of purple , and my brow is wrinkled .: 93.00
<S> but the paper nowhere identifies this fernand with your father . 40100m no ; but the connection will be seen by others , and therefore i will have the article contradicted . at the words i will , beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to albert s countenance , and then as gradually lowering them , he remained thoughtful for a few moments .: 88.96
<S> milady therefore continued , coloring her narrations more and more .: 153.17
<S> i descended the staircase step by step ; the only thing i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees .: 109.35
<S> excuse me ; and he began to laugh loudly , but nervously .: 49.06
<S> between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss .: 42.98
<S> he was , therefore , about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time , when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind .: 39.66
<S> franz had , as yet , found nothing to say ; he had come to no determination , and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him , he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past , or wait until he had more proof ; besides , although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening , he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum .: 32.76
<S> what do i know of the grecian affair ?: 26.27
<S> come to us this evening and to morrow we ll return your visit . capital !: 47.02
<S> this time , however , his address , although polite , was cooler than usual .: 39.19
<S> she spoke some words to lord de winter in english , who thereupon requested d artagnan s permission to retire , excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away , and charging his sister to obtain his pardon .: 48.87
<S> we must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road , and when they have passed we will take the opposite direction . there was a stream close by and a bridge across it .: 61.59
<S> were they , then , so necessary ? they were indispensable . the major passed his hand across his brow .: 42.32
<S> only , during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him , he reflected , partly on the means of deceiving merce de s as to the cause of his absence , partly on plans of emigration and abduction , as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo , at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible , watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man , who was for him also the messenger of vengeance .: 57.05
<S> but as a man of honor should answer another , tell me fairly , shall you pay these with the same punctuality ? morrel shuddered , and looked at the man , who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown .: 62.55
<S> i am aware he is a furious royalist ; but , in spite of that , and of his being king s attorney , he is a man like ourselves , and i fancy not a bad sort of one . perhaps not , replied danglars ; but i hear that he is ambitious , and that s rather against him . well , well , returned m. morrel , we shall see .: 32.35
<S> i will give you the baton of the marechal de la meilleraie , who does not seem to be much in favor just now . and so , sir , said the queen , you are seriously afraid of a public tumult . seriously , said gondy , astonished at not having further advanced ; i fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful destruction . and i , said the queen , think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose it .: 53.13
<S> they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons , and happily , never failed of being prepared for his coming .: 59.49
<S> and if i have any counsel to give , it is , always lose ! she seemed to love me so ! she seemed , did she ? oh , she did love me ! you child , why , there is not a man who has not believed , as you do , that his mistress loved him , and there lives not a man who has not been deceived by his mistress . except you , athos , who never had one . that s true , said athos , after a moment s silence , that s true !: 37.32
<S> it was a superb moonlight night .: 38.58
<S> he saw d artagnan and porthos enter with internal pleasure , yet showed no joy in his countenance .: 43.45
<S> and you , my dear companion , said he , you speak of the baronesses , countesses , and princesses of others ? pardieu ! i spoke of them because porthos talked of them himself , because he had paraded all these fine things before me .: 47.53
<S> ma foi , said monte cristo , rubbing his elbow , it s all your servant s fault ; your stairs are so polished , it is like walking on glass . are you hurt , sir ? coldly asked morrel .: 50.20
<S> at least , i am now at liberty to believe , without too much fatuity , that you love another , said the young man , in a caressing tone , and i repeat that i am really interested for the count . you ? asked milady .: 23.08
<S> i believe in you , and i would have all the merit of my devotion , even if that devotion were stupidity .: 38.69
<S> are you not the beloved of one of my best friends ? dear d artagnan !: 19.87
<S> take this , said madame de villefort , giving her smelling bottle to valentine .: 24.29
<S> coquenard .: 51.74
<S> but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss . no , for i am only embarked in certainties , replied danglars , with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises ; to involve me , three governments must crumble to dust . well , such things have been . that there should be a famine ! recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine . or , that the sea should become dry , as in the days of pharaoh , and even then my vessels would become caravans . so much the better .: 96.28
<S> monsieur had just retired , and the youthful louis , remaining the last , was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle , a game which delighted him much .: 131.28
<S> alas , no ! said mme .: 10.51
<S> i , my lord , answered the gascon , i differ from monsieur d herblay entirely as to the last point , though i agree with him on the first .: 42.19
<S> her hands are icy cold , cried d artagnan .: 37.11
<S> art thou a messenger from god ; art thou a minister from hell ; art thou an angel or a demon ; callest thou thyself eloa or astarte ? do you not know me , felton ?: 107.58
<S> the emperor , now king of the petty island of elba , after having held sovereign sway over one half of the world , counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls , after having been accustomed to hear the vive napole ons of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings , uttered in ten different languages , was looked upon here as a ruined man , separated forever from any fresh connection with france or claim to her throne .: 119.25
<S> lord de winter and the three musketeers looked at one another inquiringly .: 17.92
<S> she wore a beaver hat with blue feathers , a surtout of gray pearl velvet , fastened with diamond clasps , and a petticoat of blue satin , embroidered with silver .: 52.87
<S> do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard , her shield , the pledge for her dignity , for her fortune and her life ?: 63.21
<S> i can not help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday . oh , there was no harm meant , answered danglars ; at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do ; but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings , even so far as to become one of his rival s attendants , i knew there was no further cause for apprehension . caderousse looked full at fernand he was ghastly pale .: 69.22
<S> i suffer horribly .: 84.81
<S> the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general , and he rushed on his adversary .: 68.24
<S> war has broken out in flanders .: 120.08
<S> are you aware that the mob have even suggested throwing up barricades in the rue saint denis and the rue saint antoine ? and what was comminges saying to you in reply , my good guitant ? my lord , said comminges , i answered that to compose a ligue only one ingredient was wanting in my opinion an essential one a duc de guise ; moreover , no generation ever does the same thing twice . no , but they mean to make a fronde , as they call it , said guitant .: 96.01
<S> after the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet , and threw it to the charming danseuse , who , in the third act , to do honor to the gift , reappeared with it on her finger .: 50.67
<S> yes , sir , replied julie with hesitation ; what is your pleasure ?: 18.79
<S> then i should like to have three sons ; i should make the first a nobleman , like athos ; the second a good soldier , like porthos ; the third an excellent abbe , like aramis .: 64.60
<S> in the first place , i was four years making the tools i possess , and have been two years scraping and digging out earth , hard as granite itself ; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones i should once have deemed impossible to loosen .: 123.22
<S> the description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us .: 80.37
<S> at length , he one day received a letter , stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him , or at least to give notice where he might be found , on condition of receiving a large sum of money , by way of ransom .: 49.27
<S> planchet ! repeated aramis and porthos .: 22.92
<S> i understand , and foreseeing that such might be the case , i took , in spite of my ignorance of affairs , certain precautions .: 39.52
<S> farewell , monseigneur ; should i not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days , i shall presume my letter will have miscarried .: 62.41
<S> there was only this blow wanting . then he said aloud , my dear friend , your attack has , perhaps , fatigued you ; had you not better repose awhile ?: 61.66
<S> well , continued the count , in a tone that made franz shudder , this young gentleman is one of my friends this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself this young gentleman has been up and down the corso for eight hours in my private carriage , and yet , i repeat to you , you have carried him off , and conveyed him hither , and , added the count , taking the letter from his pocket , you have set a ransom on him , as if he were an utter stranger . why did you not tell me all this you ? inquired the brigand chief , turning towards his men , who all retreated before his look .: 40.13
<S> then , if he should forget that visit , you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it ? not at all . ah , that gives me more confidence . this skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the gascon s soul .: 49.89
<S> it was mordaunt with the order in his hand .: 22.21
<S> a week before his return lord de winter died , leaving me his sole heir .: 51.43
<S> there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of caderousse ; it was plain that the small shagreen case , which he turned over and over in his hand , did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze .: 48.71
<S> all right . and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise .: 51.96
<S> yes , replied the brigadier ; and as his head is valued at a thousand roman crowns , there would have been five hundred for you , if you had helped us to catch him . the two young persons exchanged looks .: 36.30
<S> i will take him dead , that s all . a terrible cry was heard , and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people ; the latter knew that this officer , who was so pale , but who appeared so determined , would keep his word ; they continued to threaten , but they began to disperse .: 51.28
<S> the man was caderousse he was pale and his shirt was all bloody .: 55.55
<S> it was not the coat , unexceptional in its cut , though simple and unornamented ; it was not the plain white waistcoat ; it was not the trousers , that displayed the foot so perfectly formed it was none of these things that attracted the attention , it was his pale complexion , his waving black hair , his calm and serene expression , his dark and melancholy eye , his mouth , chiselled with such marvellous delicacy , which so easily expressed such high disdain , these were what fixed the attention of all upon him .: 73.00
<S> at the end of three quarters of a league , within fifty paces of festubert , a larger bloodstain appeared ; the ground was trampled by horses .: 30.25
<S> friquet , whose eye , ever on the alert , could alone have discovered them , had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of a house in the square of notre dame .: 51.32
<S> as for the the atre franc ais , you know , of course , that it is nowhere .: 41.70
<S> the moaning of waves , the noise of thunder , the roaring of a volcano , can not be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment .: 36.25
<S> mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of cromwell s permission .: 67.51
<S> then another important thing , raoul : should you be wounded in a battle , and fall from your horse , if you have any strength left , disentangle yourself from the line that your regiment has formed ; otherwise , it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the horses .: 77.26
<S> a single portrait , signed by le opold robert , shone in its carved and gilded frame .: 73.57
<S> is there anyone in the lobby ? said the president .: 32.92
<S> the host called the stable boy , and ordered him to saddle le blanc then he awoke his son , a child of seven years , whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse .: 66.44
<S> in addition to this , after a half hour s conversation d artagnan was convinced that milady was his compatriot ; she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head .: 66.15
<S> do you know what torture is ?: 32.05
<S> your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold air . ah !: 41.08
<S> eight days had been occupied in preparations at the ho tel de ville for this important evening .: 19.89
<S> as long as it was dark they remained silent ; in spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity , and apprehended ambushes on every side .: 50.39
<S> mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for saint germain , but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her .: 46.23
<S> at this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way , my father fell on one knee , and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth , armed with sabres , pistols , and poniards twenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man , and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons , and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet .: 92.44
<S> who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket ? asked the duke .: 27.95
<S> i retreated with the rest , for eight and forty hours .: 53.28
<S> i think it will be wise to set off , said d artagnan .: 13.74
<S> therefore , scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival .: 40.87
<S> and you say that monsieur d artagnan was one of those four men ? he led the enterprise . and who were the others ? i leave it to monsieur d artagnan to name them , my lord .: 27.17
<S> bonacieux ; but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head , her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets only she believed she could say she was not dead .: 58.03
<S> go on with your affair , monsieur , cried planchet ; i have finished mine . seeing this , the gentleman drew his sword , and sprang upon d artagnan ; but he had too strong an adversary .: 37.18
<S> your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits . what ! cried albert , whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely , not make any resistance ! no , for it would be useless .: 56.44
<S> how is that , my friend ? why , thus it is , replied dante s .: 15.04
<S> as certainly , maximilian , as i now press your hand , i shall kill him before ten o clock tomorrow morning . morrel , in his turn , took monte cristo s hand in both of his , and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was .: 36.00
<S> thrown over the foot of the royal bed , my simar , madame , looks not unlike the mantle worn by kings . this was one of the humiliations which mazarin made anne undergo more frequently than any other , and one that bowed her head with shame .: 97.90
<S> she was a charming woman of twenty five or twenty six years , with dark hair , blue eyes , and a nose slightly turned up , admirable teeth , and a complexion marbled with rose and opal .: 36.13
<S> danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed ; but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them , composed of the betrothed pair , a party of young girls in attendance on the bride , by whose side walked dante s father ; the whole brought up by fernand , whose lips wore their usual sinister smile .: 90.77
<S> in case of a check mazarin made a slight movement , one must foresee everything ; in the case of a check , he desires to retire into france and to live here as a private individual .: 75.62
<S> ten minutes sufficed for their defeat , and d artagnan remained master of the field of battle .: 31.62
<S> are you not aware that we are never seen one without the others , and that we are called among the musketeers and the guards , at court and in the city , athos , porthos , and aramis , or the three inseparables ?: 40.22
<S> compression is needed to explode gunpowder .: 261.54
<S> but said madame danglars , resolving to make a last effort , this young man , though a murderer , is an orphan , abandoned by everybody . so much the worse , or rather , so much the better ; it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate . but this is trampling on the weak , sir . the weakness of a murderer ! his dishonor reflects upon us . is not death in my house ? oh , sir , exclaimed the baroness , you are without pity for others , well , then , i tell you they will have no mercy on you ! be it so ! said villefort , raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture .: 37.07
<S> danglars , raving , threw himself on the goat skin .: 37.97
<S> a man of fifty can not long bear malice with a wife of twenty three .: 85.05
<S> happy , on the contrary , for what am i in want of ?: 32.07
<S> surely , if i am culpable and if i ask for pardon , i ought to be forgiven . then , as if his strength failed him , he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head , which drowned his voice .: 35.28
<S> now , m. danglars , ask these gentlemen where they are caught . sterlets , said cha teau renaud , are only found in the volga . and , said cavalcanti , i know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size . exactly ; one comes from the volga , and the other from lake fusaro . impossible ! cried all the guests simultaneously .: 58.45
<S> well , said athos , don t you hear monsieur de busigny , who does you the honor to ask you a question ?: 16.28
<S> athos led his guest into a dining room of moderate size , the windows of which opened on one side on a garden , on the other on a hot house full of magnificent flowers .: 61.79
<S> listen , madame , and recall your remembrances .: 39.04
<S> speak , now the queen herself releases you from your promise . the queen ! said d artagnan , with an astonishment which this time was not pretended .: 38.22
<S> not exactly , it is the wine that was sent by your order . on our account ? said the three musketeers .: 41.94
<S> are you afraid that the holy spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison ? no , my lord ; but i have already told you what that damned magician predicted . and what was it ? that the day of pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of vincennes . you believe in sorcerers , then , you fool ? i i mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers ; but it is my lord giulio who cares about them ; as an italian he is superstitious . the duke shrugged his shoulders .: 57.18
<S> now , it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects , with their long black claws , for i always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals , factions , and government intrigues .: 118.32
<S> i expected thee , said the bandit to rita s father .: 24.10
<S> the very circumstances which inflict on you , as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here , such painful emotions , are to me , on the contrary , a source of something like contentment , and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation .: 82.79
<S> i was blind ; athos has made me see , that s all ; come here . the two friends went near him .: 32.84
<S> let us not lose a moment . the four friends resumed their own clothes , girded on their swords , ordered mousqueton and blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure , and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game .: 46.66
<S> he has slain his uncle ! he murmured .: 39.35
<S> 13 ali pasha , the lion , was born at tepelini , an albanian village at the foot of the klissoura mountains , in 1741 .: 104.22
<S> his musketeer s uniform became him marvelously .: 66.38
<S> i will not forget you .: 13.49
<S> i do not wish you to be seen leaving ; our interview must be kept secret . mordaunt followed bernouin , who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper , showing him the way out .: 63.31
<S> bonacieux had named mande because mande was in an exactly opposite direction from st .: 225.23
<S> i have nothing to say that can not be said before all . juxon sat down , and the king , kneeling humbly before him , began his confession .: 37.62
<S> he was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous ; nevertheless , the keen glance of athos perceived at once it was not rogers who stood before them .: 44.98
<S> you can understand , honored and dear guardian , how precious and indispensable to me is the remembrance of the years that i have passed with you .: 65.72
<S> he has not been unreasonably exacting , it seems to me .: 23.54
<S> by force ?: 177.80
<S> by degrees , the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them , and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel .: 45.94
<S> at whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself , remember that i shall be ready to give you absolution . thank you , my lord , said the mendicant in a hoarse voice .: 31.36
<S> kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man , and heaved a deep sigh .: 22.32
<S> he then repaired to d artagnan , who , thanks to his four trusses of straw , was in the act of making up and tasting , by anticipation , the luxury of a bed so soft , so well stuffed at the head , so well covered at the foot , that it would have excited the envy of the king himself , if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own .: 38.36
<S> as for you , viscount , continued monte cristo to morcerf , you are more fortunate than the government , for your arms are really beautiful , and speak to the imagination .: 26.59
<S> they were assembled in council at the residence of athos , which always indicated an event of some gravity .: 63.27
<S> he wore his elegant uniform , d artagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak ; the swiss was six feet high , d artagnan was hardly more than five ; the swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded d artagnan as an intruder .: 43.25
<S> well , here s the case , here s where the saddle hurts me , as we french say .: 63.66
<S> cha teau renaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane .: 39.69
<S> at blois , d artagnan received the money paid to him by mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal .: 60.16
<S> milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half .: 54.15
<S> as for porthos s coat , a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in two .: 100.85
<S> that was the sloop .: 31.51
<S> and how does m. de villefort bear it ? as usual .: 30.51
<S> it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist , or had become useless .: 72.95
<S> i may continue to rely upon it , may i not ? oh , sire ! cried the four companions , with one voice , we would allow ourselves to be cut to pieces in your majesty s service . well , well , but keep whole ; that will be better , and you will be more useful to me .: 32.46
<S> he not only talked much , but he talked loudly , little caring , we must render him that justice , whether anybody listened to him or not .: 108.93
<S> scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants ; his eye rested longer on the president , and still more so on the king s attorney .: 49.87
<S> and they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing .: 105.28
<S> explain to me why going out of this chamber isn t everything . because , having neither arms nor password , we shouldn t take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel . very well , said porthos , we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms . yes , but before we can kill him and he will be hard to kill , that swiss he will shriek out and the whole picket will come , and we shall be taken like foxes , we , who are lions , and thrown into some dungeon , where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of rueil , which no more resembles the sky of tarbes than the moon is like the sun .: 65.12
<S> the abbe was a man of the world , and had , moreover , mixed in the first society of the day ; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dante s , thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature , easily acquired , as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in , and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding .: 56.95
<S> then , turning toward planchet , he made him a sign to uncock his musketoon .: 18.48
<S> we ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her child .: 53.88
<S> and he held out to the concierge the notary s order .: 44.07
<S> this was divided into three compartments one which was covered by the floor of that room in which athos , porthos and aramis were to pass the night ; the second was to serve as the sleeping room for the servants , the third , under the prow of the ship , was under the temporary cabin in which mordaunt was concealed .: 40.83
<S> sinbad the sailor . the young girl uttered a joyful cry , raised her eyes , looked round to question the messenger , but he had disappeared .: 30.19
<S> have men loved me ?: 125.44
<S> god alone knows what country will see me die .: 61.64
<S> she still had her rich fair hair ; her large , animated , intelligent eyes , so often opened by intrigue , so often closed by the blindness of love .: 101.22
<S> the duke had followed with anxiety la ramee s unspoken soliloquy , reading it from point to point upon his face .: 72.60
<S> i came to pray over the body of your daughter . and now why are you here ? i come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt , and that from this moment i will pray to god to forgive you , as i do . good heavens ! exclaimed villefort , stepping back fearfully , surely that is not the voice of the abbe busoni ! no ! the abbe threw off his wig , shook his head , and his hair , no longer confined , fell in black masses around his manly face .: 40.07
<S> i called you because you were running like a madman , and i was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea , said caderousse , laughing .: 28.68
<S> the cortege proceeded to notre dame , where a te deum was chanted .: 35.63
<S> reverend sir , murmured caderousse , seeking to regain the window , which the count pitilessly blocked reverend sir , i don t know believe me i take my oath a pane of glass out , continued the count , a dark lantern , a bunch of false keys , a secretaire half forced it is tolerably evident caderousse was choking ; he looked around for some corner to hide in , some way of escape .: 114.08
<S> lead us , grimaud . grimaud took his course across the country , and acted as guide to the cavalcade .: 65.57
<S> on her side the lady , who from time to time blushed , darted with the rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant porthos ; and then immediately the eyes of porthos wandered anxiously .: 59.88
<S> you have made up your mind at last , my lord ? said rochefort .: 18.46
<S> well , what do you propose to do ? she , said at length ; come , speak . i will go this instant and consult the queen , and we will refer the affair at once to parliament . with which you are at war is it not so ?: 40.69
<S> louis de bourbon , prince de conde , who , since the death of his father , henri de bourbon , was called , in accordance with the custom of that period , monsieur le prince , was a young man , not more than twenty six or twenty seven years old , with the eye of an eagle agl occhi grifani , as dante says aquiline nose , long , waving hair , of medium height , well formed , possessed of all the qualities essential to the successful soldier that is to say , the rapid glance , quick decision , fabulous courage .: 69.46
<S> it is then a service which you propose to render us , count ? asked anne of austria , after a moment s silence .: 16.71
<S> well , be on our side now , resumed aramis .: 22.01
<S> the reflections of the mercer were already made ; he cursed the instant when m. laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter , and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty .: 83.42
<S> ah , you fellows are good managers !: 33.10
<S> that is true , said the duke ; and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude . you have said , my lord ; for truly , at this moment when there is question of war , i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman , and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvre all which , however , will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life , if there be need of it , to accomplish it ; but i repeat it to your grace , without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first . we say , proud as a scotsman , murmured the duke of buckingham .: 54.90
<S> one window was lighted .: 28.09
<S> d artagnan has abducted my wife !: 53.09
<S> believe me , we are as well informed as you , and our police are as good as your own .: 27.57
<S> pass on , replied the guard .: 33.88
<S> the two sailors redoubled their efforts , and one of them cried in italian , courage ! the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head .: 49.34
<S> the devil ! murmured d artagnan ; all this is vague enough .: 14.71
<S> i saw her this morning , and bade her adieu . have you no particular commands to leave with me , my father ? inquired maximilian in a faltering voice .: 30.41
<S> i strode past her , and ascended to the sleeping chamber , which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder .: 59.80
<S> and , whatever people may say , continued caderousse , in his native language , which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry , i can not help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living . imbecile ! exclaimed la carconte .: 54.68
<S> as for me i can only repeat , may god protect you and all dear to you ! sir , said de guiche to his tutor , we will precede you , and you can rejoin us on the road to cambrin . the host was at his door and everything was prepared bed , bandages , and lint ; and a groom had gone to lens , the nearest village , for a doctor .: 55.23
<S> ah , you are awake , madame , he said ; then i have nothing more to do here .: 18.91
<S> but now , he said , that you are a widower , your wife s connection can not injure you . yes , but understand me ; not being of a race of historic fame , like the de courcys , who were content to be plain sirs , or the rohans , who didn t wish to be dukes , all these people , who are all either vicomtes or comtes go before me at church in all the ceremonies , and i can say nothing to them .: 74.76
<S> whole days have i passed in these titanic efforts , considering my labor well repaid if , by night time i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard bound cement , changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves ; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i dug up , i was compelled to break through a staircase , and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it ; but the well is now so completely choked up , that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery .: 131.27
<S> have you traded it for your diamond ? no .: 40.63
<S> with this , luigi purchased books and pencils .: 166.28
<S> you also ! exclaimed the executioner , you use that word which sounds ever in my ears assassinated ! i have assassinated , then , and not executed !: 81.89
<S> nothing but saddles ? now do you understand ? said athos .: 44.38
<S> the troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank ; the figures were defined like black shadows on the red tinted horizon .: 170.06
<S> the man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down , and was still pacing the street ; but , strange as it appeared , he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the champs e lyse es or by the faubourg saint honore ; his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the count s , and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing room .: 42.34
<S> to regret the world is to regret the devil ; that is my conclusion . and that is mine also , said the curate .: 46.21
<S> disarm him only make sure of his sword .: 137.49
<S> i have taught you how to handle a sword ; you have thews of iron , a wrist of steel .: 59.51
<S> he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage .: 34.57
<S> albert gathered up his papers hastily , rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord , and offering his arm to his mother , they descended the stairs .: 45.86
<S> but i am eager to see our young vicomte .: 31.13
<S> devil take me if i ve ever been so happy as at this moment . and he wiped his eyes , still moist .: 39.85
<S> he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france , bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians ; while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles , a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia .: 117.55
<S> in the meantime d artagnan took his way toward the rue tiquetonne , where he lived at the hotel de la chevrette .: 10.08
<S> what is that ? asked andrea .: 6.49
<S> there is but one service i can render you , and for that i place myself entirely at your orders , that is , to present , or make my friends present , you everywhere ; besides , you have no need of anyone to introduce you with your name , and your fortune , and your talent monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere , and be well received .: 60.09
<S> yes , let us chat , brother , said she , with a kind of cheerfulness , decided as she was to draw from the conversation , in spite of all the dissimulation lord de winter could bring , the revelations of which she stood in need to regulate her future conduct .: 46.37
<S> milady raised her head , saw close to the panes the pale face of athos , and screamed .: 40.66
<S> it was now his turn to look about him ; the ho tel de ville , a massive sixteenth century building , was on his right ; anyone could descend from the openings in the tower , and examine every corner of the roof below , and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings .: 37.29
<S> since you have no further interrogations to make , leave me , i beseech you , she said .: 29.07
<S> and you ? i am going a few steps farther . and monsieur leaves me here alone ? you are afraid , planchet ? no ; i only beg leave to observe to monsieur that the night will be very cold , that chills bring on rheumatism , and that a lackey who has the rheumatism makes but a poor servant , particularly to a master as active as monsieur . well , if you are cold , planchet , you can go into one of those cabarets that you see yonder , and be in waiting for me at the door by six o clock in the morning . monsieur , i have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me this morning , so that i have not a sou left in case i should be cold . here s half a pistole .: 50.07
<S> you may conclude your interrupted galop , so that you will owe no ill will to signor luigi , who has , indeed , throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman . you are decidedly right , and we may reach the palazzo by two o clock .: 97.01
<S> for the last time , will you come ? cried milady .: 17.17
<S> let s see .: 234.18
<S> de chevreuse , who told it to two or three of her intimates , that , yielding to his vocation , he had retired into a convent only into which , nobody knew .: 54.52
<S> uneasiness took possession of the tender , constant heart of athos , and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive aramis .: 133.33
<S> and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all ? he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time , when the door opened and euge nie appeared , attired in a figured black satin dress , her hair dressed and gloves on , as if she were going to the italian opera .: 45.56
<S> he was hungry ; he supped , he went to bed .: 24.69
<S> well , responded porthos , you may imagine , with the physique with which nature has endowed me , i am not in want of good luck . good lord , how quickly men forget ! cried the procurator s wife , raising her eyes toward heaven .: 40.19
<S> he turned his head , looked around him , and saw no one ; but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality .: 26.21
<S> at length parliament was convoked ; the authority of the king was to be maintained .: 45.00
<S> we must never look for discretion in first love .: 104.20
<S> now , supposing i am deceived , supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness .: 44.39
<S> if he returns to beaucaire without the diamond , he will inform against us , and , as he says , who knows if we shall ever again see the abbe busoni ? in all probability we shall never see him . well , then , so i will ! said caderousse ; so you may have the diamond for 45,000 francs .: 36.88
<S> a carriage waited at the door , the coachman was on the box , and a police officer sat beside him .: 26.74
<S> the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises , rubies , emeralds , opals , and diamonds .: 52.20
<S> now , in the event of the king s death , his successor inherits a crown , when the employee dies , the supernumerary steps into his shoes , and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres .: 68.43
<S> it was only known that on the following sunday a te deum would be sung at notre dame in honor of the victory of lens .: 38.60
<S> luigi vampa comes to take us , and we take him we bring him back to rome , and present him to his holiness the pope , who asks how he can repay so great a service ; then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses , and we see the carnival in the carriage , and doubtless the roman people will crown us at the capitol , and proclaim us , like curtius and horatius cocles , the preservers of their country . whilst albert proposed this scheme , signor pastrini s face assumed an expression impossible to describe .: 71.09
<S> i am dying !: 12.50
<S> several times , even , i felt a smile on my lips .: 27.66
<S> any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m. de villefort insignificant , or else dictated by venal ambition . these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before .: 58.79
<S> what is the matter ?: 6.15
<S> i no longer belonged to myself , for i had my sister in law to protect and provide for .: 39.67
<S> as for porthos , he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them .: 38.25
<S> you see i give you a wide range .: 32.87
<S> then turning toward that one of the guards who had declared himself the friend of bois tracy , besides , continued he , i have reflected , my dear intimate of bois tracy , that i am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be ; so that decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket as mine . no , upon my honor ! cried his majesty s guardsman .: 56.18
<S> see !: 35.16
<S> in the first place , he said , making an effort to control himself , we are not people who may be treated anyhow ; my friend there is the viscount of bragelonne and i am the count de guiche .: 29.47
<S> are you also the victim of a treachery ? no , said the novice , but of my devotion of a devotion to a woman i loved , for whom i would have laid down my life , for whom i would give it still . and who has abandoned you is that it ? i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so ; but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary , for which i thank god for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me .: 37.54
<S> if you could but persuade him to come out , monsieur , i should owe you the gratitude of my whole life ; i should adore you as my patron saint ! then he is there ?: 45.43
<S> besides , added he , if the smell of their roast meat tempts you , i will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice . you are a born diplomat , returned franz ; go and try . meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire .: 81.30
<S> monsieur de gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret ! you are thoughtful , said mazarin , uneasily .: 28.12
<S> who are you ? i am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the cha teau d if .: 20.59
<S> god , who can read my heart , all the gratitude i feel , will reward you !: 51.99
<S> what consequence can the reverses of fortune be to you ?: 64.73
<S> he will answer you . the king did so , and the moment after , three muffled knocks , answering the given signal , sounded beneath the floor .: 59.09
<S> humph , said morcerf , this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother ; it is evident that you wish to avoid her . monte cristo started .: 21.22
<S> then , too , i confess i should not be sorry to come across mordaunt again .: 39.70
<S> most probably morrel and cha teau renaud returned to their domestic hearths , as they say in the gallery of the chamber in well turned speeches , and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in well written pieces ; but it was not the case with debray .: 60.27
<S> what has been the result ? that , thanks to my pretended ignorance , there is none of your friends , from m. de villefort to m. debray , who has not trembled before me .: 33.43
<S> well , then , see , here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal a gentleman , only a simple magistrate , who learned more than you with all your police , and who would have saved my crown , if , like you , he had the power of directing a telegraph . the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefort , who bent his head in modest triumph .: 43.66
<S> you provide , in accordance with paragraph 1.f.3 , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of receipt of the work .: 26.97
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> in the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait .: 34.59
<S> off civita vecchia we lost our brave captain leclere . and the cargo ? inquired the owner , eagerly .: 201.17
<S> but go on , beauchamp .: 24.21
<S> none of this had escaped the count , and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an observer .: 106.71
<S> a dull and heavy sound was heard , and the man dropped like an ox on his face , and then turned over on his back .: 28.37
<S> when he is tired , he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it . but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with ; d artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter .: 45.43
<S> as villefort drew near , she advanced and stood before him .: 23.94
<S> athos , at the same moment , moved by a similar impulse , looked back also .: 41.64
<S> the sudden departure of franz , after being summoned by m. noirtier , had so much astonished everyone , that the position of madame de villefort , left alone with the notary and the witnesses , became every moment more embarrassing .: 52.05
<S> blood and anger mounted to his face ; he was resolved to unravel the mystery .: 48.19
<S> in recalling all he had been through , he foresaw all that raoul might suffer ; and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young man .: 56.24
<S> the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs , and i feel that the grave is not far distant .: 48.43
<S> again the abbe looked at him , then mournfully shook his head ; but in accordance with dante s request , he began to speak of other matters .: 38.62
<S> it was quite evident , by her manner , that her uneasiness was not feigned ; and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him , as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections , while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief , originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths .: 69.48
<S> no , my daughter is not guilty .: 24.74
<S> on their way they met grimaud .: 27.21
<S> a weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to overthrow a great design .: 117.67
<S> it was , in fact , a small craft from dunkirk bound for boulogne .: 59.18
<S> i could only utter inarticulate sounds , and irresistible faintness came over me .: 92.81
<S> porthos told him of it in his calm manner .: 24.85
<S> gaspard caderousse ; he had married a woman from the village of carconte , and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village .: 58.73
<S> it was not without foundation that a report of the king s intention to leave paris by night had been circulated .: 46.16
<S> that name written in her hand . you see , then , said athos , there is a god in heaven still ! chapter lxiv .: 41.97
<S> he found the door of his passage open , sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey .: 31.90
<S> this was the scene which presented itself to my view as i quitted my father after that last kiss .: 55.30
<S> i want to find out who was the man in the mask , who so obligingly offered to cut the king s throat . a man in a mask ? cried athos .: 54.64
<S> he then bent his body , and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs , at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled .: 48.72
<S> then , as they had been accustomed to do , they had recourse to m. de tre ville , who made some advances on their pay ; but these advances could not go far with three musketeers who were already much in arrears and a guardsman who as yet had no pay at all .: 67.83
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> what more do you want ? i wish to know if , in demanding my signature , you leave me entirely free in my person ? absolutely . then , as i said before , sir , very well ; i am ready to marry m. cavalcanti . but what are you up to ? ah , that is my affair .: 30.18
<S> i loved madame bonacieux with my heart , while i only love milady with my head , said he .: 38.93
<S> then i understood from your countenance there was more to fear than i had thought .: 81.03
<S> i am come , sir , to ask your advice . send directly to blois , raoul ; or , rather , take horse and ride immediately yourself . raoul bowed .: 52.52
<S> but you , continued m. bonacieux , in a tone of perfect good fellowship , what has become of you all these days ?: 18.66
<S> the doctor stood before him , with one hand placed on his shoulder .: 14.58
<S> when he believed that the right moment had arrived , he took the knife , pried open the teeth , which offered less resistance than before , counted one after the other twelve drops , and watched ; the phial contained , perhaps , twice as much more .: 87.96
<S> ah , sir , she muttered , ah , sir , and this was all .: 20.58
<S> like many old houses occupied by a single family , the room door was panelled with glass ; but it was locked , maximilian was shut in , and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room , because a red curtain was drawn before the glass .: 65.27
<S> what an awakening for the parisians ! said the queen , radiant .: 38.73
<S> what do you decide on , sir ? asked the notary of villefort .: 18.86
<S> the thing is simple enough .: 31.80
<S> which ? whichever of the three you like , i have no preference . and the rich caparison , is that mine , too ? without doubt . you laugh , d artagnan . no , i have left off laughing , now that you speak french . what , those rich holsters , that velvet housing , that saddle studded with silver are they all for me ? for you and nobody else , as the horse which paws the ground is mine , and the other horse , which is caracoling , belongs to athos . peste ! they are three superb animals ! i am glad they please you . why , it must have been the king who made you such a present . certainly it was not the cardinal ; but don t trouble yourself whence they come , think only that one of the three is your property . i choose that which the red headed boy is leading . it is yours ! good heaven !: 93.95
<S> upon the whole , however , the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned ; while the crew , and particularly jacopo , expressed great regrets that dante s had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits , which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each .: 73.53
<S> he tried to pass his body through the aperture , but not being like the frog in the fable , who thought he was larger than he really was , he found he must take out three or four more before he could get through .: 54.30
<S> i went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady , and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the second couplet .: 62.44
<S> m. d artagnan , my dear m. d artagnan , he called out in a coaxing voice , will you answer for everything ? i will answer for nothing .: 20.46
<S> the two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten , and retired ; but , as she left the apartment , julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance , to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features .: 51.08
<S> yes , undoubtedly , the abbe busoni himself , replied monte cristo .: 15.50
<S> at this moment raoul awoke , without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude ; his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress , for his glance , in return , had all the tenderness of love .: 54.13
<S> but on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present , consisting of an entirely new fishing boat , with two seines and a tender .: 88.05
<S> for heaven s sake , madame , said villefort , with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshness for heaven s sake , do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch !: 31.82
<S> toward the end of the fourth day of the journey athos and aramis reached nanterre , which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts , fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queen s army .: 76.85
<S> while the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars , i was reading the paper to my grandfather ; but when i came to the paragraph about you , although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening , i felt so happy , and yet so nervous , at the idea of speaking your name aloud , and before so many people , that i really think i should have passed it over , but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence ; so i summoned up all my courage , and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could . 30059m dear valentine ! well , would you believe it ?: 63.49
<S> because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbow so ; do you understand what i mean ? yes , sir .: 34.19
<S> the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin , where morrel had often waited .: 71.89
<S> hush , child ! said she .: 23.95
<S> athos , who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts , took his arm and led him into the garden .: 20.00
<S> he is only two and twenty ; he will gain himself a reputation . what do you think of that , albert ? at two and twenty to be thus famous ? yes , and at his age , alexander , c sar , and napoleon , who have all made some noise in the world , were quite behind him . so , continued franz , the hero of this history is only two and twenty ? scarcely so much . is he tall or short ? of the middle height about the same stature as his excellency , returned the host , pointing to albert .: 55.22
<S> poor girl , said debray , like the rest , paying an involuntary tribute to the sad event , poor girl , so young , so rich , so beautiful !: 52.10
<S> what a puritan you are ! said he ; that happens every day . but you can not break it off in this way ; the morcerfs are depending on this union . indeed . positively . then let them explain themselves ; you should give the father a hint , you are so intimate with the family . i ? where the devil did you find out that ? at their ball ; it was apparent enough .: 79.09
<S> shall i knock ? hush ! replied d artagnan ; the light no longer burns in yonder window . do you hear nothing ? whispered planchet .: 47.02
<S> shall i draw back my forehead from his embrace , or withhold my hand from his ?: 86.83
<S> the sword of the guardsman slipped along the barrel of the now useless weapon , and passed through the thigh of the assassin , who fell .: 66.15
<S> but his majesty has judges , and these judges will decide . that is best , said the king .: 34.37
<S> as he had said , on a camp bed , dressed in his black doublet , booted , unbelted , with his felt hat beside him , lay the king , overcome by sleep and fatigue .: 53.97
<S> for a very serious matter , which bids fair to make work for the executioner . how dreadful ! exclaimed rene e , turning pale .: 53.00
<S> the two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied with the same thought that tormented them .: 36.18
<S> yes , monsieur , the one with which i gather my fruit . lend it to us , and go into your house again ; there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you .: 42.64
<S> then a piercing cry escaped from his breast , and he cried , still the hand of god . the presence of the two victims alarmed him ; he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses .: 55.41
<S> gentlemen , i know i am in the hands of an avenging god !: 25.01
<S> what an idea !: 28.90
<S> under the other cardinal , continued d artagnan , we didn t know enough to make our profits ; this , however , doesn t concern you , with your forty thousand francs income , the happiest man in the world , it seems to me . porthos sighed .: 37.03
<S> to day , look around you , and it may astonish you , that in order to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life i have only lord de winter , the friend of twenty years , and you , gentlemen , whom i see for the first time and whom i know but as my countrymen . it is enough , said athos , bowing low , if the lives of three men can purchase yours , madame . i thank you , gentlemen .: 34.82
<S> worn out at length , he fell asleep at daybreak , and did not awake till late .: 57.72
<S> the window yielded .: 28.96
<S> d artagnan took charge of it .: 16.73
<S> the count placed himself between caderousse and the window , thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat .: 94.77
<S> the dose has been excessive , but she has only been shaken by it ; and this time , at any rate , valentine will not die . a superhuman joy expanded the old man s eyes , which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude .: 26.57
<S> here are the august signatures of your majesty s hand ; if you think you are right in giving them to me , you shall do so , but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them . and d artagnan , full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity , placed in anne s hands , in a bundle , the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty .: 49.47
<S> i am , in your opinion , a lara , a manfred , a lord ruthven ; then , just as i am arriving at the climax , you defeat your own end , and seek to make an ordinary man of me .: 47.55
<S> dante s was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria , who , having also been visited by his jailer , had come to invite his fellow sufferer to share his supper .: 33.38
<S> for whom are you looking , my fine fellow ? asked the fruiteress on the opposite side .: 27.56
<S> father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred , and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade , and follow dante s , who , after having traversed la canebie re , took the rue de noailles , and entering a small house , on the left of the alle es de meilhan , rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase , holding the baluster with one hand , while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart , and paused before a half open door , from which he could see the whole of a small room .: 49.30
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> you here , sir ! he exclaimed ; do you , then , never appear but to act as an escort to death ? busoni turned around , and , perceiving the excitement depicted on the magistrate s face , the savage lustre of his eyes , he understood that the revelation had been made at the assizes ; but beyond this he was ignorant .: 45.73
<S> it was ten o clock when they arrived .: 12.23
<S> i must speak to him about it . as to athos , his face aflame , his fists clinched , his lips bitten till they bled , he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience ; the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement .: 148.59
<S> to command inferior beings was rather a humiliation than a pleasure for her .: 230.86
<S> the young man pressed his lips on the same spot , on the old man s forehead , where valentine s had been .: 24.93
<S> the proposition had been made , and received with enthusiasm , when fortunately eleven o clock struck .: 55.17
<S> approach , gentlemen , said albert ; i wish you not to lose one word of what i am about to have the honor of saying to the count of monte cristo , for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it , strange as it may appear to you . proceed , sir , said the count .: 18.91
<S> i hear you gentlemen of the guards have been in the trenches tonight , and that you did not get much the best of the rochellais . d artagnan looked at athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation .: 43.60
<S> the count pretends i have not him to thank ; so be it i will erect an altar deo ignoto . listen , said monte cristo ; i have had little to do with it , for i am at variance both with the father in law and the young man ; there is only mademoiselle euge nie , who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony , and who , seeing how little i was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty , retains any affection for me . and do you say this wedding is at hand ? oh , yes , in spite of all i could say .: 51.98
<S> from time to time noises came in the direction of the public markets .: 29.79
<S> just reflect a little what an agitation the queen s mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years . it is true , said porthos .: 67.51
<S> it became necessary , therefore , to destroy this last bulwark of calvinism a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling .: 141.45
<S> i will run to monsieur de tre ville to tell them all this , and will meet them there . very well , monsieur , said planchet .: 16.91
<S> yes , and i say to you , if you are really strong , really superior , really pious , or impenetrable , which you were right in saying amounts to the same thing then be proud , sir , for that is the characteristic of predominance .: 63.89
<S> during this time , madame morrel had told her son everything .: 23.63
<S> asmodeus that diabolical personage , who would have been created by every fertile imagination if le sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpiece would have enjoyed a singular spectacle , if he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the rue saint germain des pre s , while debray was casting up his figures .: 81.44
<S> are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death ; or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred ?: 116.12
<S> but instead of going to her own room , valentine , having once gained her liberty , entered the gallery , and , opening a small door at the end of it , found herself at once in the garden .: 28.56
<S> the same impression was experienced by all present , and no one was deceived by the expression of his countenance .: 28.96
<S> the quarters of monsieur were at dompierre ; the quarters of the king were sometimes at estre e , sometimes at jarrie ; the cardinal s quarters were upon the downs , at the bridge of la pierre , in a simple house without any entrenchment .: 74.47
<S> go to , go to !: 51.65
<S> and in three months time , said albert , you will be at my house ? shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour ? inquired the count ; only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements . day for day , hour for hour , said albert ; that will suit me to a dot . so be it , then , replied the count , and extending his hand towards a calendar , suspended near the chimney piece , he said , today is the 21st of february ; and drawing out his watch , added , it is exactly half past ten o clock .: 46.38
<S> it was done on purpose for me i am sure of it . sir , said the baroness humbly , are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed , that they talked of going to law with him , that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight , which proves that he was either mad or guilty ?: 53.57
<S> it was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme , for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad .: 48.29
<S> the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it , together with the fish for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat .: 118.50
<S> hold your tongue , hypocrite , said andrea ; you love me ! yes , i do , or may the devil take me .: 28.34
<S> have you never heard that queen anne of austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen ? yes , at the time of her relations with monsieur de buckingham ; it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds . well , it was that affair , madame ; these men are the ones who saved her ; and i smile with pity when i reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them , who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm . well , then , my lord , they must be found ; but what can four men , or rather three men do for i tell you , you must not count on monsieur d artagnan . it will be one valiant sword the less , but there will remain still three , without reckoning my own ; now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies , to be at his side in battle , to aid him with counsel , to escort him in flight , are sufficient , not to make the king a conqueror , but to save him if conquered ; and whatever mazarin may say , once on the shores of france your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm . seek , then , my lord , seek these gentlemen ; and if they will consent to go with you to england , i will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne , besides as much gold as would pave whitehall .: 63.90
<S> she will take me for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are placed about her as spies !: 66.27
<S> can i trust in you ? oh , madame ! cried the young woman , falling on her knees ; upon my soul , i am ready to die for your majesty ! this expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart , and , like the first , there was no mistaking it .: 22.08
<S> pardon , madame , he said , i am not a lawyer , i am a mere soldier , and probably , therefore , i do not quite comprehend the value of certain words ; i ought to have said the wishes , and not the will , of the people .: 31.52
<S> what had you to revenge on the marquis de saint me ran ? oh , it was not on him , monsieur ; it was on another . this is strange , returned monte cristo , seeming to yield to his reflections , that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse . monsieur , said the steward , it is fatality , i am sure .: 33.82
<S> the name of monte cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate , to whom valentine s i am coming was the customary signal of farewell .: 47.41
<S> this way , this way , my dear albert ! said he , holding out his hand to the young man .: 12.64
<S> stories of gypsies , who steal children , are not at all in vogue in this part of the world , and would not be believed .: 45.97
<S> to what country ? demanded porthos .: 19.68
<S> ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville , but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor , guarding mazarin carefully .: 83.47
<S> porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar .: 25.39
<S> from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music , with the whirl of the waltz and galop , while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds .: 33.04
<S> well , sir , said the young girl , do you understand now , and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject ? but before the notary could answer , villefort had drawn him aside .: 32.75
<S> he now arose , his head bowed beneath the weight of grief , and , shaking his damp , dishevelled hair , he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father , that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes , someone by whose side he might weep .: 73.06
<S> you were right , my lord , said felton , with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of milady , you were right , my lord , and i was wrong . and both again left the room .: 21.02
<S> nay , it must have been a promise . a country clown , said anne of austria , people will laugh . let them , answered d artagnan .: 38.14
<S> let my lord at two o clock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with la ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts . and then ? your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again . i understand , said the duke .: 51.26
<S> m. de tre ville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen .: 26.12
<S> tomorrow , at the ho tel field of the cloth of gold , a lackey in black and red will wait for your reply . oh ! said d artagnan , this is rather warm ; it appears that milady and i are anxious about the health of the same person .: 41.21
<S> sit down , and i will read it again . albert resumed his seat , and beauchamp read , with more attention than at first , the lines denounced by his friend .: 40.05
<S> he stopped one moment at the door for baptistin , whom he saw in the rue matignon , and who was running .: 34.40
<S> i thought you had softened .: 56.34
<S> baron danglars is a good father , and knows how to calculate . in that case , said andrea , everything is all right , excepting your refusal , which quite grieves me . you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances . well , said andrea , let it be as you wish .: 57.72
<S> we have served them to the best of our poor means , and god will recompense the will , forgive the want of power .: 44.20
<S> comminges had arrested one of the ringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of du trahoir ; but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the market place with stones and halberds ; the delinquent had escaped to the rue des lombards and rushed into a house .: 50.46
<S> tomorrow morning i start for paris ; four days to go , and the same to return , with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me , is all the time i shall be absent .: 54.49
<S> d artagnan s ball took off his enemy s hat .: 35.35
<S> the gate opened , a carriage rolled down the avenue , and stopped at the steps .: 13.63
<S> i , who am going to give you another piece of good advice . what is it ? to leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger .: 30.48
<S> besides , although she avoided coming within speaking distance , valentine arranged so that maximilian could see her pass and repass , and each time she went by , she managed , unperceived by her companion , to cast an expressive look at the young man , which seemed to say , have patience !: 64.59
<S> the pistol fell from his hands .: 21.01
<S> approach , and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known . sire , it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world . really impossible !: 60.09
<S> while the rest slept , then , we went away a short distance ; we severed our fetters with a file the englishman had given us , and swam away . and what is become of this benedetto ? i don t know . you ought to know . no , in truth ; we parted at hye res . and , to give more weight to his protestation , caderousse advanced another step towards the abbe , who remained motionless in his place , as calm as ever , and pursuing his interrogation .: 51.17
<S> you want to know how we came here ?: 33.95
<S> you will give me a copy this evening , which i shall know by heart tomorrow . d artagnan looked at his friends , as if to say , well , what did i tell you ? now , continued he , addressing planchet , you have eight days to get an interview with lord de winter ; you have eight days to return in all sixteen days .: 30.06
<S> his breast was covered with a coat of mail ; the knife was bent against it .: 30.67
<S> sir , sir , cried he , turning to noirtier , do what you can make me understand in some way ! yes , replied noirtier .: 21.48
<S> grimaud shook his head negatively .: 41.93
<S> lord winter is killed , then ? inquired d artagnan , fixing his eyes on the corpse .: 19.11
<S> do you know monsieur d artagnan ? he added , looking steadfastly at the queen .: 13.34
<S> i am a sailor . not a second was to be lost .: 31.69
<S> it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl s mind as to the reality of the scene ; her eyes started with terror , her hands trembled , and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her .: 35.04
<S> olivain managed in his turn to land , after crossing himself repeatedly ; and the people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able toward the bank , with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the boat .: 47.88
<S> i was conducting some friends , musketeers , one of whom , by the by , had a dispute with a stranger a man who sought a quarrel with him , for i don t know what . exactly so , said the host ; i remember it perfectly .: 36.46
<S> project gutenberg ebooks are often created from several printed editions , all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the u.s. unless a copyright notice is included .: 31.97
<S> what was most pressing was to get mme .: 71.33
<S> but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night ?: 18.92
<S> i promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner .: 48.29
<S> morrel expected villefort would be dejected ; he found him as he had found him six weeks before , calm , firm , and full of that glacial politeness , that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar man .: 87.76
<S> within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade , her usual beverage , and a glass .: 51.44
<S> morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord .: 75.85
<S> now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge .: 43.70
<S> come ; reflect , and decide . your goodness confounds me , monseigneur , replied d artagnan , and i am conscious of a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm ; but since monseigneur permits me to speak freely d artagnan paused .: 54.95
<S> what s the matter ? asked planchet .: 9.02
<S> the abbess , who was the daughter of a noble house , took particular delight in stories of the court , which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom , and which , above all , have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents , at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away .: 64.38
<S> i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds , with your signature alone , and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us .: 64.62
<S> but , said morrel , the culprit the murderer the assassin . do not alarm yourself , sir ; justice will be done , said villefort .: 35.05
<S> here , after a short conference , they proposed to separate .: 48.99
<S> the result was that the two men communicated with one another ; how long they did so , nobody knows .: 43.77
<S> i have told you my wish , or rather my determination .: 17.94
<S> she found milady with a smiling countenance .: 37.51
<S> i know it ; and the duke put the quill to the paper .: 23.70
<S> they will think we are trying to leave england and will search for us at the ports ; meanwhile we shall reach london with the king .: 42.61
<S> who art thou ?: 58.59
<S> but d artagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head , dismounted , and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing , he approached the valet de chambre with a smile on his lips .: 19.60
<S> he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes , that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends .: 44.71
<S> and if you wish ever to leave my palace , you can not ; so make the best of it .: 37.47
<S> you know the marquis of saint me ran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to paris , and the marchioness a few days after her arrival ? yes , said monte cristo , i have heard that ; but , as claudius said to hamlet , it is a law of nature ; their fathers died before them , and they mourned their loss ; they will die before their children , who will , in their turn , grieve for them . but that is not all . not all ! no ; they were going to marry their daughter to m. franz d e pinay .: 34.56
<S> act prudently . oh , do not fear ; besides , you will accompany me .: 38.70
<S> the king , don carlos , has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at bourges , and has returned to spain by the catalonian frontier .: 32.89
<S> felton lowered his head and reflected .: 24.91
<S> little acquainted as i am with the habits of parisians , i should not have thought this the place for such a demand . still , if people will shut themselves up , said albert , and can not be seen because they are bathing , dining , or asleep , we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen . i am not difficult of access , sir ; for yesterday , if my memory does not deceive me , you were at my house . yesterday i was at your house , sir , said the young man ; because then i knew not who you were . in pronouncing these words albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby .: 50.77
<S> how much do i owe this gracious prince !: 73.10

<S> as soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from laporte and ran to meet her .: 31.25
<S> listen , said the abbe , extending his hand over the wounded man , as if to command him to believe ; this is what the god in whom , on your death bed , you refuse to believe , has done for you he gave you health , strength , regular employment , even friends a life , in fact , which a man might enjoy with a calm conscience .: 53.85
<S> over a species of altar , and beneath a canopy of blue velvet , surmounted by white and red plumes , was a full length portrait of anne of austria , so perfect in its resemblance that d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it .: 42.94
<S> melancholy in a capitalist , like the appearance of a comet , presages some misfortune to the world . i have been in ill luck for several days , said danglars , and i have heard nothing but bad news . ah , indeed ? said monte cristo .: 42.96
<S> the queen , on whom he threw himself as sole support , seemed to him now not much to be relied upon .: 49.93
<S> he would never think of faring in the same manner as his master ; he only drank from the cask .: 49.38
<S> quick ! said a voice at the end of the gallery .: 12.79
<S> hey , yes , thank god , i am pretty well , said mousqueton .: 20.52
<S> the count does not know ? how should i know ?: 22.76
<S> i would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost it . he would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand ; but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him .: 65.63
<S> morrel was dreaming , and monte cristo was looking at the dreamer .: 30.98
<S> the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter , and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily .: 95.43
<S> ah , count , he esteems you so highly , tell him that he has spoken amiss . and she took two or three steps forward .: 30.05
<S> after the siege i shall enter the house of the lazarists .: 34.47
<S> the very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house , now become the property of dante s , were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds , etc. , that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house , without the least augmentation of rent , upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited .: 71.75
<S> porthos brought up the rear , and before soldiers , officers , or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the street .: 78.45
<S> albert seized it , and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him , he suffered albert to retain it .: 33.63
<S> my god , yes , gave , that is the word , said porthos ; for the animal was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis , and the stingy fellow would only give me eighty . without the saddle ? said aramis .: 40.52
<S> royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns .: 18.79
<S> the parisians , always curious , always affected by funereal display , looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles .: 143.80
<S> are the carbines loaded ? yes , brigadier . well , you guard the exterior , and if he attempts to fly , fire upon him ; he must be a great criminal , from what the telegraph says . the brigadier , followed by the commissary , disappeared by the inside staircase , accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting andrea had excited in the crowd .: 63.24
<S> by all means , replied the governor , and he signed to the turnkey to open the door .: 22.68
<S> but i must see him instantly . take care , madame , said athos , for he knows neither his father nor his mother . you have kept the secret !: 38.01
<S> the recompense will exceed your expectations ; that is all i promise you . more intrigues !: 71.58
<S> tell me where ? there !: 69.99
<S> let me look at that sapphire again ; the one i mentioned to you had one of its faces scratched by accident . d artagnan took off the ring , giving it again to athos .: 55.25
<S> we are coming to your aid . olivain advanced , retired , then made his horse rear turned it and then , struck to the core by shame , leaped , as raoul had done , only repeating : i am a dead man !: 72.81
<S> the baron might possibly have perceived it , but , attributing it to a caprice , feigned ignorance .: 70.53
<S> often he awoke in the night , suddenly , dreaming that he had been robbed of monsieur de beaufort .: 42.78
<S> of course , we hope that you will support the project gutenberg mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg name associated with the work .: 14.82
<S> let me hasten to add , continued he , that the testator , having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune , and having alienated it all , the will will not bear scrutiny , and is declared null and void . yes . said villefort ; but i warn m. d e pinay , that during my life time my father s will shall never be questioned , my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained . 40032m sir , said franz , i regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of mademoiselle valentine ; i have never inquired the amount of her fortune , which , however limited it may be , exceeds mine .: 63.19
<S> ah , sir !: 8.45
<S> now one of two things must happen : either matters will not be arranged , or they will be arranged , in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again . sir , said aramis , you speak to the point .: 49.03
<S> it is said , sympathy travels rapidly , and when at tre port , i felt the electric shock ; you have either been working for me or thinking of me . possibly , said monte cristo , i have indeed thought of you , but the magnetic wire i was guiding acted , indeed , without my knowledge . 30277m indeed !: 71.59
<S> a terrible howling interrupted these reflections of d artagnan and mme .: 45.02
<S> tre ville , that s impossible ! it is as i have the honor to relate it to your majesty . jussac , one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom ? well , sire , for once he found his master . i will see this young man , tre ville i will see him ; and if anything can be done well , we will make it our business . when will your majesty deign to receive him ? tomorrow , at midday , tre ville . shall i bring him alone ? no , bring me all four together .: 36.57
<S> on the next day mathieu mole , the chief president , whose courage at this crisis , says the cardinal de retz , was equal to that of the duc de beaufort and the prince de conde in other words , of the two men who were considered the bravest in france had been attacked in his turn .: 45.46
<S> but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here ; i do not see morrel . morrel ?: 46.34
<S> does he think we are going to take him in ?: 26.56
<S> at first , on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed , d artagnan tried in vain to open it , but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels , which gave way , d artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock .: 34.32
<S> you hear , madame , said the king , who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent , but without guessing the cause .: 35.39
<S> he was carried home in the arms of the people .: 24.12
<S> there was a moment at which he felt something like remorse .: 21.13
<S> the court made songs on the parisians and the parisians on the court ; and the casualties , though not mortal , were painful , as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule .: 91.65
<S> pardon me , monseigneur , for saying such things , but they form my excuse .: 84.33
<S> the moment that d artagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him , he recovered his usual tranquillity .: 28.36
<S> this was a matter of dispute between the holy father and his son .: 24.38
<S> well ! resumed mme .: 15.32
<S> anne , reclining in a large easy chair , her head supported by her hand , her elbow resting on a table , was looking at her son , who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures .: 26.80
<S> athos , on quitting aramis , went to madame de chevreuse .: 13.82
<S> trembling and awe struck , caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest , while la carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth .: 99.38
<S> listen , said m. de tre ville ; shall i give you counsel , good counsel , the counsel of a friend ? you will do me honor , monsieur , said d artagnan .: 18.85
<S> well , continued mazarin , the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor . there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officer s eyes , which vanished immediately , for he knew nothing of mazarin s purpose .: 46.08
<S> the count came towards him .: 13.70
<S> ah , my dear friend , said madame danglars , with the same simplicity we before noticed , it is a fact .: 19.17
<S> your fortune exceeds 300,000 francs , does it not ? asked he .: 29.79
<S> the cardinal has said several things which have agitated me , therefore i will not speak more fully now .: 73.02
<S> very well , my lord ; it shall be so . d artagnan saluted , went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarin s flattering promises , which gave porthos an indescribable happiness .: 58.61
<S> why do you not realize a six months , a year s advance even , and retire to brussels ?: 91.49
<S> my labor is all in vain , for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers . that s true , said dante s ; but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell ; there are three others do you know anything of their situation ? this one is built against the solid rock , and it would take ten experienced miners , duly furnished with the requisite tools , as many years to perforate it .: 80.23
<S> raoul is gone to blois and is ignorant of my departure ; watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can ; and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence , tell him to open a packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at blois , of which i send you now the key .: 67.56
<S> milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation .: 33.59
<S> as he had prophesied would be the case , he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg , and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself .: 78.65
<S> get in , laporte . laporte obeyed .: 53.21
<S> the host and his wife were standing on the steps , whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk .: 44.63
<S> this man , except a sword , had all the appearance of a soldier ; and his buff boots , still slightly covered with dust , indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the day .: 30.68
<S> thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner , whom , notwithstanding her hints , she persisted in watching all night .: 43.52
<S> d avrigny ! cried villefort ; or rather i will go for him myself . he flew from the apartment , and morrel at the same moment darted out at the other door .: 26.36
<S> then i shall be free , i shall have an independent fortune , and and what ? demanded morrel .: 35.28
<S> if i could die , he said , i should go where he goes , and should assuredly find him again .: 29.06
<S> whether he heard mordaunt or not as he entered , cromwell did not move .: 69.66
<S> he had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey , and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy .: 37.97
<S> well , then , at the end of a month , when drinking water from the same carafe , you would kill the person who drank with you , without your perceiving , otherwise than from slight inconvenience , that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water . do you know any other counter poisons ? i do not . i have often read , and read again , the history of mithridates , said madame de villefort in a tone of reflection , and had always considered it a fable . no , madame , contrary to most history , it is true ; but what you tell me , madame , what you inquire of me , is not the result of a chance query , for two years ago you asked me the same questions , and said then , that for a very long time this history of mithridates had occupied your mind . true , sir .: 58.14
<S> monsieur bertuccio , said the count , you have procured me windows looking on the piazza del popolo , as i ordered you yesterday . yes , excellency , returned the steward ; but it was very late . did i not tell you i wished for one ? replied the count , frowning .: 20.48
<S> i shall strangle you both if you don t get out , said porthos at last , seizing mousqueton by the throat .: 50.19
<S> alas , sir , said he , i can not but perceive how sadly i miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you . i certainly am surprised , replied m. de tre ville , that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport , the sole resource of us poor be arnese . i had one , sir , and , thank god , such as i could wish , cried d artagnan ; but it was perfidiously stolen from me . he then related the adventure of meung , described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness , and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted m. de tre ville .: 53.14
<S> her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening , so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to franz .: 39.46
<S> you are running your heads into a very silly affair ; you will be riddled .: 68.75
<S> my brother had arrived the previous evening at ni mes , and , at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality , he had been assassinated .: 16.09
<S> how you manoeuvre my instructions , count !: 66.17
<S> there was no further question , therefore , about marie michon among the four musketeers , who besides had what they wanted : that was , the order to withdraw mme .: 72.15
<S> my dear friend , cried the lieutenant , if you say a word i will blow out your brains . but , sir , answered the steward , do you know that these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon ? so much the better ; they must be good animals , then . sir , i shall call my people . and i , mine ; i ve ten guards behind me , don t you hear them gallop ?: 27.18
<S> athos went close to it , and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent , remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice .: 50.16
<S> noirtier wishes to speak . yes , indicated noirtier , with an expression the more terrible , from all his faculties being centred in his glance .: 63.33
<S> name to me such of your workmen as you need , and point out the tools they must bring . the goldsmith knew the duke .: 123.71
<S> it was one of the gascon s artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty .: 73.25
<S> dear constance !: 37.84
<S> god knows , i would prefer sacrificing the whole , so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home . poor valentine ! i seem to myself as though living a life of bondage , yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that i fear to break the restraint in which i am held , lest i fall utterly helpless .: 76.19
<S> i lost him then , with all his appointments and furniture . really , this is frightful . stop a minute ; you don t know all yet .: 46.81
<S> i have studied chemistry because , having determined to live in eastern climates i have been desirous of following the example of king mithridates . mithridates , rex ponticus , said the young scamp , as he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album , the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast . edward , you naughty boy , exclaimed madame de villefort , snatching the mutilated book from the urchin s grasp , you are positively past bearing ; you really disturb the conversation ; go , leave us , and join your sister valentine in dear grandpapa noirtier s room . the album , said edward sulkily .: 103.07
<S> she has a fruitful imagination , and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first . and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton , and led him out , laughing .: 48.90
<S> d artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance , and when he had finished said , and madame bonacieux , do you know who carried her off ? for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance . ah ! said bonacieux , they took good care not to tell me that ; and my wife , on her part , has sworn to me by all that s sacred that she does not know .: 43.34
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it , neither was it so wicked as dante s thought it , since this man , who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize money , manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall .: 75.45
<S> this track soon disappeared ; it was evident that he had touched the shore .: 27.43
<S> soon , said hayde e , we halted on our march , and found ourselves on the borders of a lake .: 41.40
<S> if , on the contrary , i die , remember , maximilian , my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man .: 31.62
<S> the king , who was entirely surrounded , walked alone in a great empty space .: 53.24
<S> tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has given .: 67.35
<S> she bit her handkerchief with her beautiful teeth .: 33.26
<S> merce de s saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all ; but as she was prudent and strong minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears .: 61.75
<S> do you refuse ? said merce de s , in a tremulous voice .: 8.49
<S> confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me , and gradually i fell into a deep , heavy slumber .: 88.67
<S> you , a queen to quarrel like a washerwoman !: 102.19
<S> do you say , resumed d artagnan , that you suspect that impertinent gentleman ? i tell you i am sure of it , continued the host .: 16.04
<S> nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond , on the pretext of his being too rich . indeed , that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable . poor count !: 63.97
<S> free to leave me . leave you ?: 64.57
<S> at last d artagnan , having got up too close , stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust , but the moment when , after a fine , quick feint , he was attacking as sharply as lightning , the wall seemed to give way , mordaunt disappeared through the opening , and d artagnan s blade , caught between the panels , shivered like a sword of glass .: 62.21
<S> the young man , with the intuitive perception of a lover , quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed , and he was comforted .: 46.42
<S> i think so ; am i not right , m. de villefort ? asked monte cristo .: 12.85
<S> ali alone was present to wait at table , and acquitted himself so admirably , that the guest complimented his host thereupon .: 78.98
<S> monte cristo , although apparently indifferent , had not lost one word of this conversation , and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary .: 40.70
<S> is he much changed ? he has become an abbe , that is all . you alarm me ; his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings . on the contrary , said athos , smiling , he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abbe , and you will find him a veritable soldier . could you engage to bring him to me to morrow morning at ten o clock , on the pont du louvre ? oh , oh ! exclaimed athos , smiling , you have a duel in prospect . yes , count , and a splendid duel , too ; a duel in which i hope you will take your part . where are we to go , my lord ? to her majesty the queen of england , who has desired me to present you to her . this is an enigma , said athos , but it matters not ; since you know the solution of it i ask no further .: 34.61
<S> cloud let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous jaws .: 217.76
<S> once on board we drop down the thames and in two hours are on the open sea .: 90.18
<S> this is what i propose to do , said athos .: 10.46
<S> the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .: 25.39
<S> there is but one way left you that is safe , said she ; it is through my grandfather s room . she rose .: 31.13
<S> you say , then , he continued , that the count de rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal ? yes , and the queen , too . the queen , do you say ? to inspire us with confidence she has even placed in mazarin s hands that famous diamond you remember all about it that i once sold to monsieur des essarts and of which , i don t know how , she has regained possession . but it seems to me , said porthos , that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you . so i think , replied d artagnan ; but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies ; nevertheless , since they are the ones who have riches and honors , we are devoted to them . yes , we are devoted to them , repeated porthos ; and you to whom are you devoted now ? to the king , the queen , and to the cardinal ; moreover , i have answered for your devotion also . and you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf ? magnificent , my dear fellow , magnificent !: 37.23
<S> ah , my child , my poor child ! cried the baroness , falling on her chair , and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief .: 14.38
<S> speak quickly , friend . the man said , in a low voice : i wish i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris .: 35.99
<S> there were two doors ; he bolted them both .: 74.45
<S> it is not here ! he cried .: 12.90
<S> you know what it is to love , my lord .: 14.64
<S> it is not their fault that they are bandits , but that of the authorities . how so ? because they are pursued for having made a stiff , as if it was not in a corsican s nature to revenge himself . what do you mean by having made a stiff ? having assassinated a man ? said franz , continuing his investigation .: 48.30
<S> what does all this mean ? asked aramis .: 11.99
<S> the plan adopted by d artagnan was soon perfected .: 58.97
<S> at the first blow the sound ceased , as if by magic .: 19.29
<S> the novice sat down .: 22.38
<S> d artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder .: 22.97
<S> indeed ? why , you knew it , porthos , said aramis .: 20.75
<S> do you pity him ?: 20.05
<S> today the preliminaries , tomorrow or next day the ceremony !: 159.68
<S> aramis and his thesis d artagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his procurator s wife .: 42.59
<S> speak , i am ready to obey . no , monsieur , no ; i am not called louis the just without reason .: 32.11
<S> franz and albert descended , the carriage approached the palace ; their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats ; the cicerone sprang into the seat behind .: 56.11
<S> well , said aramis , what think you about these two enemies whom it requires , besides comminges s troop , ten good soldiers to confront ; are they not as like as two drops of water to d artagnan and porthos ? we ll search paris all day long , said athos , and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to picardy ; and i feel no doubt that , thanks to d artagnan s ready invention , we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts . yes , let us search paris and especially inquire of planchet if he has yet heard from his former master . that poor planchet !: 72.86
<S> down with the officer !: 84.35
<S> ah , i have been running very fast , mademoiselle , but i must do m. morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster . noirtier directed their attention to a waiter , on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass .: 66.96
<S> yes , sir . come nearer , said the magistrate , with a patronizing wave of the hand , and tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of this visit . do you not guess , monsieur ? asked morrel .: 23.24
<S> i can be useful in one way only if knowledge of parisian habits , of the means of rendering yourself comfortable , or of the bazaars , can assist , you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling here .: 95.70
<S> he double locked it , took the key , returned to the bedroom door , removed the double staple of the bolt , and went in .: 34.75
<S> no , i do not jest , mordieu ! i should like to have seen you in my place !: 29.09
<S> of this wine , the first bottle being a little thick at the bottom , brisemont poured the lees into a glass , and d artagnan desired him to drink it , for the poor devil had not yet recovered his strength .: 54.44
<S> my dear cousin . ah , ah ! said athos .: 13.60
<S> porthos turned aside , in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind .: 66.75
<S> what would the abbe please to have ?: 45.13
<S> yes , your french husband .: 56.86
<S> ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub , but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested .: 126.17
<S> porthos had been trying a new horse ; d artagnan was on guard at the louvre ; aramis had been to visit one of his penitents in the neighborhood ; and athos , whose domicile was established in the rue guenegaud , found himself close at hand .: 41.04
<S> he endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude .: 39.31
<S> alas , do you not know ? what new calamity ? my daughter mademoiselle danglars ? euge nie has left us ! good heavens , what are you telling me ? the truth , my dear count .: 29.01
<S> a brotherhood of penitents , clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth , with holes for the eyes , and holding in their hands lighted tapers , appeared first ; the chief marched at the head .: 104.30
<S> then some words were spoken by the two women .: 28.84
<S> it is evident , by their sending for me , that matters are becoming complicated .: 59.02
<S> say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor , for then i can continue my work in safety .: 38.55
<S> as the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants .: 32.80
<S> yes , very well .: 13.97
<S> large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow , while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned .: 107.94
<S> it is a lovely night , and a walk without rome will do us both good . shall i take any arms ? for what purpose ? any money ? it is useless .: 51.32
<S> a cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy .: 144.09
<S> a propos , monseigneur , continued tre ville , addressing the cardinal , monsieur de cahusac is quite recovered , is he not ? thank you , said the cardinal , biting his lips with anger .: 21.26
<S> at the sound of the key turning in the lock , and the creaking of the hinges , dante s , who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon , whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above , raised his head .: 30.25
<S> some few words passed between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods converse .: 71.46
<S> you see it is not my fault . and maximilian was patient , and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girls , one fair , with soft languishing eyes , a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow ; the other a brunette , with a fierce and haughty expression , and as straight as a poplar .: 68.04
<S> if i am a prisoner , what crime have i committed ? you are here in the apartment destined for you , madame .: 29.41
<S> i never saw a man with a nobler air than his . without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can , said porthos .: 76.08
<S> in particular , there is one yonder of a gascon look .: 58.34
<S> you are mistaken , my lord , blood will flow ; and may that blood fall back on those who cause it to flow ! felton uttered a cry , and rushed toward her .: 45.47
<S> well what ? responded franz .: 57.35
<S> allowing his head to sink upon his two hands , he pretended to sleep .: 38.57
<S> monsieur , said emmanuel , have the goodness to address yourself to m. delaunay .: 35.23
<S> so you see , being in constant fear of being forced from that position , i am armed to the teeth . and yet , said d artagnan , laughing , it appears to me that from time to time you must make sorties . and he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans .: 40.06
<S> however , the morning of the appointment , the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs .: 39.28
<S> bravo !: 16.42
<S> contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided , there was this morning in his personal appearance something tardy and irresolute .: 68.62
<S> haste ! said felton ; do you not see that each of your words burns me like molten lead ? then , continued milady , then i collected all my strength ; i recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance , or rather , of justice , had struck .: 60.66
<S> you must hope for us both , maximilian ; that will make me at least partly happy . but why must you leave me so soon ? i do not know particulars .: 47.05
<S> it was completely deserted .: 26.01
<S> though we scarcely expected it , our secret remained in our own keeping alone .: 134.24
<S> what has the count done ?: 26.49
<S> d artagnan , who though wanting in practice had a sound theory , redoubled his agility .: 101.85
<S> as i look at it , a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the ohio .: 68.65
<S> the old man obeyed .: 11.85
<S> i appreciate your calm reasoning .: 133.23
<S> come , don t look so angry , and you shall have 4,000 francs of the money to do what you like with , and euge nie shall have 2,000 .: 51.60
<S> he put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them , and accompanied by porthos returned to settle with mousqueton , who , naively , and like the worthy steward that he was , handed them four hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself .: 45.31
<S> the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation .: 8.83
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> morrel was only thirty one , barrois was sixty years of age ; morrel was deeply in love , and barrois was dying with heat and exertion .: 56.81
<S> you are very fortunate , my friend ; but take care or you will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet , and which also comes , no doubt , from your publisher . aramis blushed to the eyes , crammed in the letter , and re buttoned his doublet .: 53.56
<S> did i ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to marie de medici ? never .: 43.84
<S> then he is here ? he is , said monte cristo ; when the valet de chambre came in just now , he told me of his arrival . ah , very well , very well , said the major , clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation .: 24.09
<S> the fifth of september the extension provided for by the agent of thomson french , at the moment when morrel expected it least , was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him .: 92.24
<S> patience , madame , i am coming to it . that s fortunate . in april you went to dine at the minister s .: 45.28
<S> d artagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in question .: 63.71
<S> yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance , and dante s knew that he had escaped the first peril .: 43.96
<S> it was m. de villefort , and not the prefect , who returned to the house of m. de villefort .: 11.65
<S> is it as hopeless as he thinks ? alas !: 31.85
<S> i have to pay a visit this evening , replied he .: 20.03
<S> the footman s mission was an easy one .: 61.51
<S> pardieu , beauchamp , mine shall be a splendid funeral ! when such resolutions are made , albert , they should be promptly executed .: 86.19
<S> i bought it from him , but it belongs to d artagnan .: 15.18
<S> it was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means of death of which we were speaking ; a death without agony , a death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing valentine s name and pressing your hand . yes , you have guessed rightly , morrel , said the count , that is what i intended . thanks ; the idea that tomorrow i shall no longer suffer , is sweet to my heart . do you then regret nothing ? no , replied morrel .: 45.70
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> but this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the multitude .: 135.49
<S> that will insure his confidence . athos smiled .: 41.65
<S> i know all that , for it is with the justice of all countries especially that i have occupied myself it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural justice , and i must say , sir , that it is the law of primitive nations , that is , the law of retaliation , that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god . if this law were adopted , sir , said the procureur , it would greatly simplify our legal codes , and in that case the magistrates would not as you just observed have much to do . it may , perhaps , come to this in time , observed monte cristo ; you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple , and simplicity is always perfection . in the meanwhile , continued the magistrate , our codes are in full force , with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs , roman laws , and frank usages ; the knowledge of all which , you will agree , is not to be acquired without extended labor ; it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge , and , when acquired , a strong power of brain to retain it . i agree with you entirely , sir ; but all that even you know with respect to the french code , i know , not only in reference to that code , but as regards the codes of all nations .: 75.13
<S> monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other , when another door opened , and he found himself opposite to the count of morcerf in person .: 35.50
<S> that of rouen ; but you will leave the city on your right .: 46.41
<S> it had now become a weary and almost hopeless task , and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor , friendship and gratitude , implanted in their hearts , our two travelers would have given up many a time their rides over the sand , their interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of faces .: 90.60
<S> the timely arrival of d artagnan in paris .: 20.40
<S> i have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions , and brought the offenders to merited punishment .: 166.43
<S> the people were shouting and running about with torches .: 49.47
<S> i was there , too , and i never shall forget the old man s smile at this prescription .: 24.40
<S> her lips were cold ; it appeared to d artagnan that he had embraced a statue .: 22.43
<S> he first advanced towards the baroness , who was chatting with madame de villefort , who had come alone , valentine being still an invalid ; and without turning aside , so clear was the road left for him , he passed from the baroness to euge nie , whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms , that the proud artist was quite struck .: 53.42
<S> a man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it , with which he urged on his slow team , was walking with the cart .: 39.46
<S> i speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen , of the ornaments , of the journey you made with three of your friends . aha ! thought the gascon ; is this a snare or not ?: 54.29
<S> observe , said villefort , smiling , i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels , and that the 9th thermidor and the 4th of april , in the year 1814 , were lucky days for france , worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order ; and that explains how it comes to pass that , fallen , as i trust he is forever , napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites .: 121.25
<S> benedetto , if still living , will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other , and then be duly punished in his turn .: 77.42
<S> the axe , an ingenious device , and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is ; you frighten me not , executioner s axe , added he , touching it with the cane which he held in his hand , and i strike you now , waiting patiently and christianly for you to return the blow . and shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on .: 70.61
<S> i wanted to cry out to warn the king , but that very moment i felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head , and fell insensible .: 41.47
<S> that renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much haste . oh , i comprehend now , said the astonished porthos .: 53.64
<S> my mother gave it him , and as she did so , looked whiter than the marble against which she leaned .: 41.32
<S> probably , said athos .: 24.52
<S> oho ! said they , not in bed at a quarter past eleven .: 54.21
<S> villefort fell back on his chair , passed his hand over his brow , moist with perspiration , and , for the third time , read the letter .: 21.32
<S> do you hear it ?: 12.63
<S> you have done right , lieutenant , said the soldier .: 21.67
<S> bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold , and forgot that he came to announce d artagnan , who , curious to know who the mendicant could be , came to aramis on leaving athos .: 40.23
<S> what is the matter ? said the count .: 4.84
<S> the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin , and there could now be no doubt that he was the count .: 24.71
<S> patience !: 57.69
<S> who s there ? cried caderousse , rising , and drawing up in a heap the gold and notes scattered over the table , and which he covered with his two hands .: 40.19
<S> overpowered with agitation , the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door , and reached her room in an agony of fear .: 55.88
<S> in what ? in a pate , for example . in a pate ? said la ramee .: 32.83
<S> will you permit a grandson of henry iv .: 24.59
<S> two ladies , sleeping in one bed , were awakened by the noise , and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded , they saw a man .: 30.83
<S> bonacieux , we shall hear no more . on the contrary , said d artagnan , we shall hear better . d artagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber another ear of dionysius , spread a carpet on the floor , went upon his knees , and made a sign to mme .: 27.19
<S> my first impulse , on coming to myself , was to feel under my pillow for the knife i had not been able to reach ; if it had not been useful for defense , it might at least serve for expiation .: 45.31
<S> the man in the mask .: 23.34
<S> louis xiii. , like every weak mind , was wanting in generosity .: 89.83
<S> monte cristo bent his head .: 10.20
<S> now , then , cried carlini , rising in his turn , and approaching the corpse , his hand on the butt of one of his pistols , does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me ? no , returned the chief , she is thine . carlini raised her in his arms , and carried her out of the circle of firelight .: 26.11
<S> not at all ? why , just think for a moment ; with this red handkerchief on my head , with scarcely any shoes , no papers , and ten gold napoleons in my pocket , without reckoning what was there before making in all about two hundred francs , why , i should certainly be arrested at the barriers .: 73.58
<S> on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father , the servants all fled with muttered imprecations ; they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages , then there was a rush in the court , afterwards all was still ; they had , one and all , deserted the accursed house .: 85.47
<S> my god !: 11.06
<S> nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had occurred .: 56.29
<S> linen and wine are both being warmed ; come . the young men had no objection to this proposition ; on the contrary , they thought it very timely .: 62.79
<S> the abbe shook his head .: 9.68
<S> well , we are going to give a ball to mazarin . i hope so . and when will the dance begin ? the invitations are given for this evening , said the coadjutor , but the violins will not begin to play until to morrow morning . you may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the chevalier d humieres has promised me whenever i need them . upon fifty soldiers ? yes , he is making recruits and he will lend them to me ; if any are missing when the fete is over , i shall replace them . good , my dear rochefort ; but that is not all .: 59.06
<S> the superior education of dante s gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its accuracy .: 69.03
<S> but mazarin is a low born rogue , who can at the most take us by the collar , like an archer .: 79.97
<S> then he looked anxiously at valentine .: 24.82
<S> porthos had his fits .: 61.85
<S> through the darkness franz , whose eyes were now more accustomed to it , could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing , and then , as they rounded a rocky point , he saw the fire more brilliant than ever , and about it five or six persons seated .: 56.83
<S> an instant after , the guardsman descended in his turn .: 21.69
<S> meanwhile , the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him ; but the first lines aroused his attention ; he read them again and again , and fixing his eyes on m. de morcerf , count , said he , you have said that the vizier of yanina confided his wife and daughter to your care ? yes , sir , replied morcerf ; but in that , like all the rest , misfortune pursued me .: 35.69
<S> but you sent for me , my dear child .: 14.75
<S> already up , raoul ? exclaimed the count .: 56.53
<S> he , the support , the liberator , the father of the people !: 37.10
<S> athos , porthos , and aramis , after having had an entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much , created such a disturbance that the provost of the castle , a rigid man , has ordered them to be confined for some days ; but i accomplish the order they have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my anjou wine , with which they are much pleased .: 47.44
<S> she is gone , said he ; she must have returned to the louvre . you are sure , replied the stranger , that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out ? no , replied bonacieux , with a self sufficient air , she is too superficial a woman . is the young guardsman at home ? i do not think he is ; as you see , his shutter is closed , and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters . all the same , it is well to be certain . how so ? by knocking at his door .: 32.02
<S> what do you mean , grimaud ? he exclaimed .: 10.17
<S> the former had no doubt finished his questions , for a moment later he said good night and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier .: 82.53
<S> fernand s mind was made up ; he would shoot dante s , and then kill himself .: 36.78
<S> this house , in past years , did ours a great service , and has , i know not for what reason , always denied having rendered us this service . i shall be at your orders , said monte cristo bowing .: 55.81
<S> in the meantime , as we have said , mazarin was in his closet , putting his affairs in order .: 19.31
<S> had valentine fainted ?: 298.84
<S> i felt , in bending my head toward you , your beautiful hair touch my cheek ; and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot .: 83.92
<S> had surrounded himself , this second , or rather this first king of france , became desirous that he , too , should have his guard .: 78.46
<S> the morrels have been shipowners from father to son ; and there was a morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at valence . pardieu ! and that is true ! cried the owner , greatly delighted .: 70.92
<S> i can see nobody , said d artagnan .: 13.45
<S> if those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault , we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch , and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a miracle . bravo ! cried porthos .: 58.10
<S> she had profited by my absence , and furnished with the half of the linen , and having written down the day and hour at which i had deposited the child at the asylum , had set off for paris , and had reclaimed it .: 53.78
<S> buckingham , the executioner of this angelic creature ! cried felton .: 52.47
<S> he took them up , just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road , and threw them out of the house . neat , remarked d artagnan .: 36.82
<S> dante s had entered the cha teau d if with the round , open , smiling face of a young and happy man , with whom the early paths of life have been smooth , and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past .: 74.99
<S> yes , my lord . well , let us set out . how many men does your eminence wish to escort you ? you say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows ; as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred , take eight as many as my lord wishes . i will follow you .: 39.84
<S> holloa , monsieur d artagnan ! said he , is not that you whom i see yonder ? d artagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy .: 15.22
<S> the baron came forward .: 28.74
<S> here , doctor , said he , is what you sent me for . was this prepared in your presence ? yes , replied the procureur .: 24.86
<S> madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage , on the other side of which she found her carriage , and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her .: 46.61
<S> but the real adieux were made in mme .: 50.87
<S> twice he was obliged to step back ; his opponent stirred not one inch .: 142.38
<S> the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once .: 27.26
<S> morrel held out his hand to her .: 16.87
<S> at every step that edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald ; afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag .: 101.09
<S> well , his love is half real , half fanciful .: 65.75
<S> observing his indifference , he shrugged his shoulders , saying : send on your business those who do theirs at the same time !: 77.00
<S> you would like very well to be at liberty on that beach !: 48.51
<S> you promised to bring a knife , and to leave it with me after our interview . say no more of that , madame , said felton .: 39.59
<S> good god ! raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger .: 53.00
<S> what was most clear in the matter was that d artagnan loved milady like a madman , and that she did not love him at all .: 29.41
<S> what was i saying ?: 22.69
<S> at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses .: 70.88
<S> on arriving at the cradle from which paris sprang they found it inundated with water , and it was again necessary to take a boat .: 54.18
<S> so that monsieur watched bassompierre ; the king , the duc d angoule me ; and the cardinal , m. de schomberg .: 38.08
<S> the abbe took the note .: 19.76
<S> i faith ! said d artagnan to raoul , you were just in time to stay my hand .: 24.81
<S> turn chartreux or trappist , and relate your secrets , but , as for me , i do not like anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms , and i do not choose that my servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening .: 47.42
<S> this is modesty indeed ! cried d artagnan .: 26.37
<S> you are right a mute from the east !: 55.87
<S> the old man remained motionless ; he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head .: 31.06
<S> the latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke , a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal , who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of anne of austria .: 51.45
<S> believe me , madame , as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosom a heart devoted to you believe that you have been the idol of our lives ; that we have , as you well know good heaven ! risked our lives twenty times for your majesty .: 67.29
<S> the old servant introduced morrel by a private entrance , closed the door of the study , and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of valentine .: 40.35
<S> yes , yes , continued lord de winter , i understand .: 8.76
<S> without passports ? he murmured .: 26.48
<S> my dear fellow , let them sleep on , if they are asleep ; let them grow pale in their drowsiness , if they are disposed to do so , and pray do you remain in peace , who have no remorse to disturb you . deep grief was depicted on morrel s features ; he seized monte cristo s hand .: 50.61
<S> but as if to contradict his statement , at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation , while a sudden gust of wind , mingled with rain , extinguished the lamp he held in his hand .: 60.32
<S> remove from me the remains of doubt , which , if it change not to conviction , must become remorse ! the count bowed his head , and clasped his hands together .: 43.74
<S> monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step .: 18.96
<S> the next morning he left that inn as he had left the ho tel des princes , without being noticed , walked down the faubourg saint antoine , along the boulevard to rue me nilmontant , and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter s absence .: 37.19
<S> before god and before men , said he , i accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the duke of buckingham . the duke of buckingham assassinated ! cried all present , with one voice .: 50.08
<S> and what was most frightful , continued milady , her voice altered , as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute , was that at this time i retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me ; was that my soul , if i may say so , waked in my sleeping body ; was that i saw , that i heard .: 58.23
<S> go into the cavern with hayde e. i will not quit you , said vasiliki ; if you die , my lord , i will die with you . go to selim ! cried my father .: 34.27
<S> you have forgotten it , porthos ? said he .: 12.04
<S> it is here ; unlock the door , antoine . the turnkey obeyed , and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the mad abbe , as the prisoner was usually called .: 62.54
<S> he did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me , when he knows that , alone and isolated as i am , i seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors .: 48.16
<S> it was porthos .: 16.25
<S> nevertheless , monsieur de tre ville s company of musketeers alone can not maintain a war against the cardinal , who disposes of the forces of all france , and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will .: 60.63
<S> at length they entered a path which , going out from the road , skirted the mountainside .: 46.33
<S> you know anne of austria ; the captivity of mazarin alone guarantees my life ; if you let him go i am a dead man . i needed nothing less than that consideration , my dear d artagnan , to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer .: 54.82
<S> d artagnan s plan was very simple .: 16.10
<S> it is true that the habit of a novice , which the young woman wore , was not very advantageous in a contest of this kind .: 36.81
<S> singular bandits ! he exclaimed ; they have left me my purse and pocket book .: 47.42
<S> you are the directors of all consciences .: 31.24
<S> the ball it was in the warmest days of july , when in due course of time the saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at m. de morcerf s .: 55.51
<S> the count s tutor was well acquainted with the country ; he consequently proposed to take a crossroad , which lay between that of lens and that of bethune .: 49.32
<S> then came the question of gallantry and love affairs .: 81.46
<S> it was then generally reported that mademoiselle de villefort , the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of saint me ran , had regained the good graces of her grandfather , and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300,000 livres .: 24.48
<S> my dear beauchamp , i wish you to contradict this statement . beauchamp looked at albert with a benevolent expression .: 24.01
<S> thus bassompierre , who was at once protestant and catholic protestant by conviction and catholic as commander of the order of the holy ghost ; bassompierre , who was a german by birth and a frenchman at heart in short , bassompierre , who had a distinguished command at the siege of la rochelle , said , in charging at the head of several other protestant nobles like himself , you will see , gentlemen , that we shall be fools enough to take la rochelle . and bassompierre was right .: 69.43
<S> in the morning it was rumored that prince de conde had evacuated bethune and fallen back on carvin , leaving , however , a strong garrison in the former city .: 77.45
<S> bravo ! cried one of the guests ; that is what i call talking to some purpose . just the person we require at a time like the present , said a second .: 45.72
<S> villefort , she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner .: 50.68
<S> do not lose time , comminges , he continued ; get out of the carriage if you can and make another draw up ; be quick , or in five minutes the mob will be on us again with swords and muskets and you will be killed .: 54.63
<S> all at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall .: 21.64
<S> let your majesty mount on horseback and place yourself in the midst of us ; we will cross the tyne , reach scotland , and you will be saved . is this your counsel also , winter ? inquired the king .: 44.23
<S> his voice had become rough and hoarse ; his face was furrowed with wrinkles ; his eyes burned under the blue veined lids , and he tottered like a drunken man .: 44.27
<S> come along , athos , come along ! cried d artagnan ; now we have found everything except money , it would be stupid to be killed . but athos continued to march majestically , whatever remarks his companions made ; and they , finding their remarks useless , regulated their pace by his .: 77.37
<S> there were caskets of diamonds , cashmere shawls , valenciennes lace , english veils , and in fact all the tempting things , the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy , and which is called the corbeille .22 now , in passing through this room , andrea proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent , but also provident , for he helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before him .: 98.96
<S> athos was pale , and trembled in every limb .: 25.30
<S> i ?: 34.71
<S> the queen was still standing when he entered ; but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair , and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools , and with an air of supreme hauteur , said , what do you desire , monsieur , and with what object do you present yourself here ? to make , madame , in the name of the king , and without prejudice to the respect which i have the honor to owe to your majesty a close examination into all your papers . how , monsieur , an investigation of my papers mine !: 43.66
<S> cross them ; that s right ! felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief , and then with a cord over the handkerchief .: 77.86
<S> at the footman s announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out , with some curiosity .: 54.91
<S> those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames .: 50.33
<S> pardon me at least , such i have heard is your custom . nay , madame .: 53.38
<S> i shall soon return , said the banker to monte cristo ; wait for me .: 25.58
<S> they were both aroused at seven o clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant , who brought a letter for d artagnan .: 39.79
<S> will you go up with me ? i follow you . monte cristo entered the tower , which was divided into three stories .: 23.47
<S> but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count that eye which lived in her memory , and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship .: 61.11
<S> keep the struggle for yourself , bear all the suffering , but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts ; for she deserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her , and providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty .: 85.01
<S> seated opposite to him , monte cristo watched him in the shadow , and morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count .: 30.12
<S> their demand was fair , and the chief inclined his head in sign of acquiescence .: 72.63
<S> no ; i searched the whole thicket .: 36.98
<S> my lord , answered de chavigny , with a low bow , i have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns .: 44.35
<S> tis settled , replied d artagnan .: 9.41
<S> the first was just disappearing in the straits of bonifacio ; the other , following an opposite direction , was about to round the island of corsica .: 42.48
<S> and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her , and where luigi awaited her .: 47.16
<S> to my offer of liberty , he replied that it was nothing but a snare , and that before he came out he intended to impose his own conditions .: 35.87
<S> you mean to say we have lost , said athos , quietly , drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table .: 26.92
<S> albert summoned his servant , and ordered him to acquaint m. and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo .: 20.39
<S> the next day merce de s came to implore the protection of m. de villefort ; she did not obtain it , however , and went to visit the old man ; when she saw him so miserable and heart broken , having passed a sleepless night , and not touched food since the previous day , she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him ; but the old man would not consent .: 34.69
<S> what is life to you ? nothing .: 36.96
<S> monsieur , said the cardinal , you have been arrested by my orders . so they tell me , monseigneur . do you know why ? no , monseigneur , for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your eminence . richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man .: 27.12
<S> it seems , sir steward , said he , that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price . his excellency is not , perhaps , aware that m. danglars gave 16,000 francs for his horses ? very well .: 49.36
<S> the question , then , was how to change this probability into a certainty .: 48.68
<S> they made all speed to come up to this gentleman , who appeared to be in great haste .: 22.30
<S> no one could guess what the dirty rag could be ; i alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man .: 69.94
<S> i was compelled , at this period , to leave corsica on an important expedition ; i reflected for a long time , and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune , i resolved that benedetto should accompany me .: 65.31
<S> i have made him a spy upon his wife . the comte de rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great , and retired .: 31.16
<S> yes , and to hang me . they shall not have the king . nor hang me . listen .: 65.21
<S> on the fourth , he was no longer a man , but a living corpse .: 24.33
<S> tell your client that , although i am the insulted party , in order to carry out my eccentricity , i leave him the choice of arms , and will accept without discussion , without dispute , anything , even combat by drawing lots , which is always stupid , but with me different from other people , as i am sure to gain . sure to gain ! repeated beauchamp , looking with amazement at the count .: 78.56
<S> andrea ran to the other door , leading to the gallery , ready to rush out ; but he was stopped short , and he stood with his body a little thrown back , pale , and with the useless knife in his clenched hand .: 46.09
<S> on seeing the appointed signal , groslow , who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot , walked straight up to the gentlemen .: 68.94
<S> morrel , said he , it is a happy day for me , to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you .: 19.87
<S> as he approached , carlini raised his head , and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man s eyes .: 19.42
<S> he had now leisure to look to his wound .: 51.31
<S> my daughter , continued danglars , when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband , he has always some reason for wishing her to marry .: 45.65
<S> the mob dispersed .: 90.12
<S> at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy , and forced him to ask for mercy .: 38.15
<S> what is the matter with you , my friend ? asked the latter .: 6.48
<S> everything is clear to me now .: 40.09
<S> we have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he appeared .: 63.88
<S> then , here s to our next merry meeting ! adieu , dear captain , said porthos , i shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony . yes , yes , when the campaign is over , replied the gascon .: 35.24
<S> and you killed her ? the monk exclaimed .: 27.82
<S> d artagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat .: 17.96
<S> unfortunately , the hour was badly chosen for a private conference .: 54.73
<S> in ho tels that do not flourish , everything is in confusion , and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his host .: 52.67
<S> suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard .: 25.55
<S> he might be recognized , not only by these signs , but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion , as a frenchman .: 46.15
<S> you have not played for a long time , d artagnan . and i have no inclination to play . swear to nothing .: 28.17
<S> now , said gondy , there is a communion between us .: 18.84
<S> he bowed politely to the baroness , familiarly to danglars , and affectionately to monte cristo .: 32.17
<S> it is an algebraic axiom , which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity , and not from an unknown to a known ; but sit down , sir , i beg of you . monte cristo pointed to a chair , which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself , while the count merely fell back into his own , on which he had been kneeling when m. villefort entered .: 43.10
<S> i have my pride for men serpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot .: 146.17
<S> both were in shadow and the sybil of cuma herself could not have read them .: 81.68
<S> all we have hitherto done in the matter has been child s play .: 83.25
<S> speak ! you condemned me to a horrible , tedious death ; you killed my father ; you deprived me of liberty , of love , and happiness . who are you , then ?: 47.28
<S> he entered third , and aramis , who shut the gate after him , last .: 66.93
<S> they read to noirtier the formal copy of a will , in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally couched ; then , in order to test the capacity of the testator , the first notary said , turning towards him : when an individual makes his will , it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person . yes . have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune ? yes . i will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation ; you will stop me when i reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions ? yes . there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation .: 44.22
<S> well , i should think so , since the count has found him a false father since the count gives him four thousand francs a month , and leaves him 500,000 francs in his will . ah , yes , said the factitious abbe , who began to understand ; and what name does the young man bear meanwhile ? andrea cavalcanti . is it , then , that young man whom my friend the count of monte cristo has received into his house , and who is going to marry mademoiselle danglars ? exactly . and you suffer that , you wretch ! you , who know his life and his crime ? why should i stand in a comrade s way ? said caderousse .: 34.60
<S> the carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time appointed .: 23.47
<S> i was saying it was very interesting . what was ? all you were showing me .: 42.80
<S> you had begun to pervert my poor felton .: 122.31
<S> he would , no doubt , have believed that he had returned to the times of florian , and would have declared , on reaching paris , that he had met an alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the sabine hill .: 47.88
<S> a groom was rubbing them down ; near them were saddles and bridles .: 104.83
<S> and aramis ? i have seen him also , said d artagnan ; but he seemed to me cold . ah , you have seen aramis ? said athos , turning on d artagnan a searching look .: 26.70
<S> my wife and my daughter would die of it !: 24.95
<S> sometimes when the cardinal , always on horseback , like the lowest gendarme of the army , cast a pensive glance over those works , so slowly keeping pace with his wishes , which the engineers , brought from all the corners of france , were executing under his orders , if he met a musketeer of the company of tre ville , he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner , and not recognizing in him one of our four companions , he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction .: 58.80
<S> she read : it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone .: 58.30
<S> and any other love but mine would have sunk beneath this ordeal ; but my love came out from it more ardent and more eternal .: 108.78
<S> paris is not paved with cambric ! monsieur , you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me , said d artagnan , in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions .: 103.43
<S> on his return from the vatican , franz carefully avoided the corso ; he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts , to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation .: 77.22
<S> no , madame ; if you have forgotten the history of oedipus , i , at least , remember it . really , sir , you are delightful , and i should like to spend a month at bragelonne . are you not afraid of making people envious of me , duchess ? replied athos .: 36.02
<S> this lasted several minutes , until the frightful overturn of reason was accomplished ; then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter , he rushed down the stairs .: 43.57
<S> he is a fine young man , of fair complexion a little too fair , perhaps pleasing in manners ; but you will see and judge for yourself . by the way , said the major , you know i have only the 2,000 francs which the abbe busoni sent me ; this sum i have expended upon travelling expenses , and and you want money ; that is a matter of course , my dear m. cavalcanti .: 48.42
<S> from the day i first saw you , all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection .: 46.82
<S> weep , said athos , weep , heart full of love , youth , and life !: 48.17
<S> can it be on account of the amours of madame de bois tracy ? said d artagnan , wishing to have the air , in the eyes of the citizen , of being posted as to court affairs .: 30.98
<S> de se vigne .: 243.85
<S> cavalcanti s father will be gone . but the son will be here ; will you invite young m. cavalcanti ? i do not know him , viscount . you do not know him ? no , i never saw him until a few days since , and am not responsible for him . but you receive him at your house ? that is another thing : he was recommended to me by a good abbe , who may be deceived .: 30.30
<S> he took the child in his arms , embraced him , shook him , called him , but the child made no response .: 31.30
<S> madeleine introduced him in presence of all the servants .: 70.06
<S> athos came down last , and found d artagnan already on horseback , and growing impatient .: 48.20
<S> what , then , have i to fear from him ? you are right , said the countess , and my fears are weakness , especially when directed against a man who has saved your life .: 38.15
<S> the mendicant had kept his word and made friquet his heir .: 64.17
<S> to prove to noirtier that he was in valentine s confidence and knew all their secrets , morrel took the dictionary , a pen , and some paper , and placed them all on a table where there was a light .: 54.61
<S> see , i have thought about you look at the good breakfast we are going to have ; nothing but what you are fond of . andrea , indeed , inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him , hungry as he was ; it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provenc al kitchens of an inferior order , added to that of dried fish , and above all , the pungent smell of musk and cloves .: 95.58
<S> do you understand ?: 10.77
<S> we are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be millionaires .: 71.14
<S> the cardinalists were three ; the musketeers , lackeys included , were seven .: 94.04
<S> i have , returned guitant .: 27.32
<S> he was , too , very learned , and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure ; but on that , indeed , he was intractable . it is the sort of malady which we call monomania , said the doctor .: 52.97
<S> i heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself . come and sit down close to me , said milady .: 26.79
<S> for women have infallible instincts ; they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented ; but i , who only understand my own figures , know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me .: 136.09
<S> oh , yes , indeed , madame , continued monte cristo , the secret dramas of the east begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion begin with paradise and end with hell .: 53.82
<S> he tore himself from the arms of porthos and aramis , and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress .: 18.53
<S> pray reflect a little .: 84.92
<S> zounds !: 34.39
<S> valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise .: 59.00
<S> the marquis of saint me ran .: 14.38
<S> but lose no time ; we have lost too much already . that is true .: 35.85
<S> an englishman visited toulon , who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy , and his choice fell on you and your companion .: 81.47
<S> but do not be alarmed on her account .: 30.28
<S> when the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom .: 80.20
<S> the old man , wrapped in a large black doublet , in which the whole of his slender body was concealed , was brisk and dry .: 22.78
<S> well , then , your guest will be poisoned at the fifth remove , and die , at the end of eight or ten days , of pains in the intestines , sickness , or abscess of the pylorus .: 39.23
<S> paris has been sufficiently punished ; enough blood has flowed , enough misery has humbled a town deprived of its king and of justice .: 184.70

<S> i will not answer for them .: 13.07
<S> good !: 24.94
<S> edmond smiled when he beheld himself ; it was impossible that his best friend if , indeed , he had any friend left could recognize him ; he could not recognize himself .: 47.25
<S> i don t believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads , for heads are not taken off without previous trial ; a trial would make a noise , and a noise would get the attention of our friends , who would check the operations of monsieur de mazarin . how well you reason ! said porthos , admiringly .: 50.84
<S> for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen , he compelled dante s to learn it by heart ; and dante s knew it from the first to the last word .: 69.66
<S> this alone can stop me in my onward career , before i have attained the goal at which i aim , for all the rest i have reduced to mathematical terms .: 88.70
<S> but lord de winter makes cruel accusations against you .: 48.31
<S> let us try and overtake this gentleman , said raoul to olivain ; like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company . it was about four o clock in the afternoon when raoul arrived at compiegne ; there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them .: 47.61
<S> the wise , unerring faria could not be mistaken in this one thing .: 59.51
<S> he criticised everybody humorously .: 164.71
<S> indeed he does , and in a most lavish manner , i can assure you . i must try and persuade m. danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner , or something of the sort , that he may be compelled to ask us in return . what , said debray , laughing ; do you really mean you would go to his house ? why not ?: 40.87
<S> my dear count , cried morcerf , you are at fault you , one of the most formidable logicians i know and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist , you are a philanthropist .: 51.10
<S> m. morrel had not readily given up the fight .: 60.15
<S> buckingham threw himself at her feet , and before the queen could prevent him , kissed the hem of her robe .: 32.05
<S> d artagnan himself was moved by them .: 24.13
<S> did none of you charge your purveyor , godeau , to send me some wine ? no !: 63.95
<S> this voice was heard by the two friends , who set off , full gallop .: 18.47
<S> now , my lord , give me , if you have not lost it , the ball that which contained the letter . the duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to grimaud .: 25.38
<S> yes , ruined !: 30.37
<S> yes ; he appears to be a resolute fellow . well , he will do more than he has promised . he will do wonders then . the curate rejoined planchet , who was waiting for him on the stairs .: 30.18
<S> the timely arrival of d artagnan in paris .: 20.40
<S> our recruits from be arn are not generally very rich , and i have no reason to think matters have much changed in this respect since i left the province .: 80.40
<S> the host drew back and burst into tears .: 37.40
<S> i shall compliment mademoiselle danglars on her cameo , while the father talks to you . if you compliment her at all , let it be on her voice , at least , said monte cristo .: 44.43
<S> and that being conducted to the scaffold , resumed the queen oh , my lord !: 37.85
<S> the king was winning ; and as he was very avaricious , he was in an excellent humor .: 20.49
<S> either help me to gain the nearest village or swear to me on your salvation that you will send me the first monk , the first cure , the first priest you may meet .: 80.77
<S> at length after a journey of nearly an hour , the carriage stopped before an iron gate , which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form , massive , and isolated .: 65.63
<S> felton , give me that knife ! and at these words , as if all her strength was exhausted , milady sank , weak and languishing , into the arms of the young officer , who , intoxicated with love , anger , and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown , received her with transport , pressed her against his heart , all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth , bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom .: 70.97
<S> oh , pardon me , pardon me ! he murmured ; if not in the name of god , at least in your own name ; if not as priest , then as son . pardon you ! cried the pretended monk , pardon you !: 50.30
<S> without communicating his thoughts to his companion , he sat down , drew out his opera glass , and looked another way .: 43.55
<S> now , my friends , said athos , finish them at a blow .: 23.71
<S> have you any money ? the four friends looked at one another , and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so cheerful .: 31.73
<S> fortunately , the mariners were used to these latitudes , and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago ; for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness corsica had long since disappeared , and monte cristo itself was invisible ; but the sailors seemed , like the lynx , to see in the dark , and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation .: 77.34
<S> that is what i call an elegant mode of attack , said albert , you were quite correct in what you said , signor pastrini .: 38.80
<S> at the dawn of day he replaced the stone , pushed his bed against the wall , and lay down .: 27.40
<S> and why ? asked the old man .: 6.55
<S> you are really ill , and just now were so pale as you came into the room was i pale , albert ? yes ; a pallor that suits you admirably , mother , but which did not the less alarm my father and myself . did your father speak of it ? inquired merce de s eagerly .: 50.63
<S> besides this , as every great action bears its recompense with it , the brave exploit of d artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost .: 66.97
<S> my only fear is that he will be too strong for you . my friend , said morcerf , with a sweet smile , that is what i wish .: 15.81
<S> gone , never to return ! oh , madame , do not think that ! i tell you he will never return .: 37.53
<S> at twenty minutes to twelve , madame danglars , tired of waiting , returned home .: 59.06
<S> this i ask of you in the name of the interest with which i inspire you , in the name of the service you have rendered me and which i never shall forget while i have life .: 43.07
<S> each was anxious to gain admission before the other .: 130.76
<S> has the corsican ogre broken loose ? cried a third .: 74.13
<S> she was coming out of marseilles harbor , and was standing out to sea rapidly , her sharp prow cleaving through the waves .: 72.10
<S> an hour passed , during which dante s , excited by the feeling of freedom , continued to cleave the waves .: 31.36
<S> everyone obeyed .: 74.22
<S> the robust scotchman , accustomed to the snows of his native hills , had stretched himself against a post , and like a fallen statue , insensible to the inclemency of the weather , had allowed the snow to cover him .: 59.24
<S> those two words , your mass , and a simple glance cast upon felton , revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make ; but with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her , this reply , ready arranged , presented itself to her lips : i ? said she , with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked in the voice of the young officer , i , sir ?: 40.79
<S> the deputy procureur du roi chapter 7 .: 24.52
<S> well , then , he deputes me to give you this . am i to consider this as part of my income on account ? no , it is for the first expenses of your settling in paris . ah , how good my dear father is ! silence , said monte cristo ; he does not wish you to know that it comes from him . i fully appreciate his delicacy , said andrea , cramming the notes hastily into his pocket .: 41.71
<S> watch her arrival , for she has great and terrible projects .: 106.54
<S> for my own part , i have laid aside even the name of my father , and altogether disown his political principles .: 42.33
<S> had stolen away this child , in order that your name might become extinct . that is reasonable , since he is an only son . well , now that all is arranged , do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten .: 72.25
<S> he will give you a horse all saddled , and will point out to you the road you ought to take .: 48.44
<S> there ! said d artagnan , what did i tell you ?: 10.80
<S> well , now let us talk a little seriously , said milady , in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to d artagnan s chair .: 24.42
<S> and they continued their way , crossing the barricades , getting the chains about their legs , pushed about , questioning and questioned .: 79.33
<S> a moment after caderousse s face appeared at the grating in the door .: 31.81
<S> it is true , she said , the arch hypocrite see ! i see , said mazarin , that everybody kneels before him , although he be but coadjutor , whilst i , were i in his place , though i am cardinal , should be torn to pieces .: 67.47
<S> you must be aware that i was ignorant of that , madame . what is that stupid fellow troubling himself about ? cried the cavalier whom milady had designated as her brother , stooping down to the height of the coach window .: 67.13
<S> the perfidious deceiver was , as may plainly be perceived , already sacrificing , in intention , the poor girl in order to obtain milady , willy nilly .: 111.96
<S> poor woman !: 27.97
<S> it is true , said he , in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard .: 10.03
<S> monsieur , continued the countess , advancing with the majesty of a queen , i owe to you the life of my son , and for this i bless you .: 21.55
<S> read ! said morrel .: 18.77
<S> good bye , albert , said beauchamp suddenly , carelessly extending his hand to the young man .: 16.29
<S> there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night ; but each of those strokes , which made up the expected hour , vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man .: 44.11
<S> in gascony tis no dishonor , sir , nobody is rich ; and henry iv. , of glorious memory , who was the king of the gascons , as his majesty philip iv .: 71.20
<S> you had only read a line or two , said d artagnan ; read the letter again from the commencement . willingly , said aramis .: 36.18
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> a family affair athos had invented the phrase , family affair .: 97.59
<S> your eminence does not then know where monsieur de beaufort is ? yes , i do , sir ; in the donjon of vincennes . yes , sir ; in a room , the walls of which are seven feet thick , with grated windows , each bar as thick as my arm . sir , replied mazarin , with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall ; with a watch spring one may saw through an iron bar . then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him , four in his chamber , four in the antechamber , and that they never leave him . but he leaves his room , he plays at tennis at the mall ? sir , those amusements are allowed ; but if your eminence wishes it , we will discontinue the permission . no , no ! cried mazarin , fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement .: 68.76
<S> years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the present .: 77.48
<S> what were you doing at the moment you were arrested ? i was at the festival of my marriage , monsieur , said the young man , his voice slightly tremulous , so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing ; so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of m. de villefort and the radiant face of merce de s .: 33.16
<S> felton arose .: 29.83
<S> monsieur albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general . excuse me , said the implacable young girl , monsieur albert claims and well deserves his share .: 102.95
<S> albert was charmed with the count s manners , and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge .: 46.37
<S> who comes there ? cried the sentinel , who was less abstracted , and who saw by the lamp light a shadow approaching his chief .: 65.47
<S> henrietta maria and mazarin .: 101.81
<S> what ? asked athos .: 7.95
<S> thus did athos and aramis make their appearance in the ante chamber , where about a dozen noblemen were collected in waiting .: 55.37
<S> he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals ; but which , mere copies as they were , seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling .: 89.67
<S> i believe , then , that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested , but because of those of a lady much greater than herself . ah , ah !: 38.29
<S> the gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors ; and , as i have said , the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator , they every moment burst into fits of laughter .: 70.60
<S> yes , for the mother s sake his poor mother ! cried the major , taking a third biscuit .: 31.70
<S> we are gentlemen ; we are , both of us , able to kill you and your eight men we two only .: 71.14
<S> battles , long journeys , blows given and received , sufficed for the first themes of conversation , which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal .: 157.75
<S> during this time nothing new occurred in the camp at la rochelle ; only the king , who was bored , as always , but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere , resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of st. louis at st. germain , and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty musketeers .: 66.66
<S> he wore a large brown mantle , one fold of which , thrown over his left shoulder , served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance , while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad brimmed hat .: 60.31
<S> felton walked into the sea up to his middle , being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody .: 92.31
<S> the rain of blood as the jeweller returned to the apartment , he cast around him a scrutinizing glance but there was nothing to excite suspicion , if it did not exist , or to confirm it , if it were already awakened .: 44.69
<S> i swear i will , by heaven . tis settled , said aramis ; at the cry jesus seigneur we go out , upset all that stands in our way , run to our horses , jump into our saddles , spur them ; is that all ? exactly . see , aramis , as i have told you , d artagnan is first amongst us all , said athos .: 45.53
<S> approach , sir , said the cardinal .: 11.03
<S> to meet d artagnan with a false excuse !: 68.68
<S> now , although la ramee appreciated , as of a certain value , the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance , still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of henry iv .: 53.20
<S> are you mad , emmanuel ?: 25.76
<S> as to grimaud , he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons .: 27.79
<S> this silence , self control , and struggle lasted about twenty seconds , then the count raised his pallid face .: 71.95
<S> oh , we can scarcely say .: 30.55
<S> yes , returned the count , i know who he is , gentlemen ; will you return to the salon ?: 19.41
<S> let us dispense with useless words .: 57.63
<S> take care , my worthy host , said albert , better is a sure enemy to well . let your excellencies only leave the matter to me , returned signor pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self confidence .: 62.66
<S> i do not allude to you , my boy .: 13.13
<S> at this announcement of a battle having taken place , the princess opened her mouth as though to ask a question of interest ; but her lips closed again without articulating a word , while the color gradually faded from her cheeks .: 43.83
<S> sir , he responded , you are a stranger , and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries , so you are not aware how human justice , so expeditious in barbarous countries , takes with us a prudent and well studied course . oh , yes yes , i do , sir ; it is the pede claudo of the ancients .: 59.35
<S> notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers , d artagnan felt completely solitary .: 72.39
<S> why should they ?: 45.50
<S> give up broussel ! she cried ; fine counsel , indeed .: 108.65
<S> i do not speak for him , but for myself . well , sir ?: 16.67
<S> this guide was our friend peppino , who dashed into the thicket of high weeds , through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road .: 86.45
<S> oh , yes ; oh , yes , i do indeed repent . and he struck his breast with his emaciated fist .: 39.02
<S> did he speak in your hearing ?: 51.10
<S> then , replied mme .: 23.69
<S> has he not seen monsieur d artagnan at my house ? oh , yes , yes ; you are right .: 13.98
<S> aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop ; the noise came nearer and nearer .: 53.28
<S> i know it will end in that way ; but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches , but i understand ; you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen .: 55.87
<S> on her side , but as softly as possible , kitty turned the key of the lock , and then d artagnan opened the closet door .: 29.37
<S> father , cried maximilian , how could you say the pharaon was lost ?: 33.24
<S> both , as this double precaution indicated , had an interest in not being recognized .: 73.00
<S> parry closed the door and approaching the king , his face radiant with joy : sire , he said , in a low voice , do you know who these workmen are who are making so much noise ? i ?: 30.75
<S> can you recollect all that ? perfectly , madame . come at dinnertime . very well . and be upon your guard before my husband , who is rather shrewd , notwithstanding his seventy six years . seventy six years !: 66.39
<S> one of our clients is a horsedealer ; he owes money to the office , and is backward in his pay .: 79.42
<S> at the door he found his carriage , and was immediately driven to the bank .: 21.28
<S> master friquet , the owner of a pistol and of a sword which louvieres had given him , had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous racket .: 93.35
<S> the water passed over his head , and the sky turned gray .: 42.44
<S> the ball was not a musket ball it was an arquebus ball .: 69.26
<S> consider , in short , your people who love you and who yet are famished , who have no other wish than to bless you , and who , nevertheless no , i am wrong , your subjects , madame , will never curse you ; say one word to them and all will be ended peace succeed war , joy tears , and happiness to misfortune ! anne of austria looked with wonderment on the warlike countenance of d artagnan , which betrayed a singular expression of deep feeling .: 86.57
<S> it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the minister toward the subordinate and the master .: 44.13
<S> we will have him informed that his sister in law is on the point of having someone assassinated , and beg him not to lose sight of her .: 28.68
<S> of course you sent for a doctor ? immediately ; but , as i have told you , it was too late . yes ; but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died . oh , yes , sir , he told me ; it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke . and what did you do then ? m .: 27.00
<S> from time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole width , darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees , and like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two parts .: 42.19
<S> good ! said the gendarme , placing his knee on his chest ; this is the way you keep your word as a sailor !: 22.81
<S> the next morning he could not see or hear ; the jailer feared he was dangerously ill. edmond hoped he was dying .: 99.25
<S> a vast crowd filled the apartments of saint germain .: 50.46
<S> she is goddaughter to laporte , the confidential valet of the queen .: 45.84
<S> it was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate , and too late for one from the director of the prison , or the doctor ; it must , then , be the visitor he hoped for .: 51.31
<S> the visitor was introduced into the drawing room , which was like all other furnished drawing rooms .: 49.52
<S> the count is fond of travelling , and , being rich , possesses a vessel of his own .: 38.38
<S> in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman , dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate , riding on a tall horse .: 45.49
<S> but he had scarcely left before danglars , with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen robert macaire represented by fre de rick,24 exclaimed : fool ! then enclosing monte cristo s receipt in a little pocket book , he added : yes , come at twelve o clock ; i shall then be far away . then he double locked his door , emptied all his drawers , collected about fifty thousand francs in bank notes , burned several papers , left others exposed to view , and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed : to madame la baronne danglars . i will place it on her table myself tonight , he murmured .: 95.03
<S> i will denounce this place of infamy .: 45.56
<S> you belong to the court , doubtless , yet i have never seen you at court .: 27.77
<S> egad , i know where he is , said d artagnan .: 10.24
<S> he embraced his weeping wife and daughter , pressed emmanuel s hand with friendly warmth , and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for cocles .: 64.34
<S> a young man we can sketch his portrait at a dash .: 59.91
<S> the lower rooms were entirely filled with kourchid s troops ; that is to say , with our enemies .: 36.54
<S> the prisoners , therefore , had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerors which they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts .: 72.82
<S> you will put yourself at the head of the first .: 19.23
<S> d avrigny , m. d avrigny , cried she , in a stifled voice .: 12.27
<S> her face was so passionless , that he , as every one else present , was incapable of reading her thoughts .: 61.06
<S> in the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table , and preserved its wholesome appearance .: 65.77
<S> raoul remained silent , for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit .: 37.32
<S> besides , we feel always a sort of mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they suppose .: 99.77
<S> this young boarder of yours , has she tried to fly ? no , that is true ; but she that is another thing ; i believe she is detained in france by some love affair . ah , said milady , with a sigh , if she loves she is not altogether wretched . then , said the abbess , looking at milady with increasing interest , i behold another poor victim ? alas , yes , said milady .: 35.87
<S> did not you sentimentally inform me with that pretty mouth of yours , so cruel to me today , that you came to england solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease , an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation that you had risked everything for it seasickness , tempest , captivity ?: 82.77
<S> the comte de la fere can not be far off , only the doors are locked . that is a slight difficulty , said porthos , and a good push with the shoulders for god s sake , porthos my friend , reserve your feats of strength , or they will not have , when needed , the honor they deserve .: 60.90
<S> you who never interest yourself in politics ? ah !: 75.47
<S> only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole . good !: 131.65
<S> in the meanwhile i am a musketeer ; in that quality i say what i please , and at this moment it pleases me to say that you weary me . aramis ! porthos ! gentlemen !: 37.74
<S> i am in the service of the king and queen of france , and form part of the company of monsieur dessessart , who , as well as his brother in law , monsieur de tre ville , is particularly attached to their majesties .: 18.87
<S> well !: 14.47
<S> it was about four o clock in the afternoon , and although the day was brilliant out of doors , we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern .: 25.68
<S> then you pity me ! sincerely , madame . and you understand what brings me here ? you wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened ? yes , sir , a fearful misfortune . you mean a mischance . a mischance ? repeated the baroness .: 31.92
<S> he found her in bed , overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation .: 40.32
<S> grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were , then shut it and double locked it , and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure .: 44.52
<S> at length she rallied , drew aside the curtain , and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on valentine .: 51.22
<S> i have placed reliance upon you , my friend .: 16.96
<S> they searched ; they questioned .: 105.49
<S> and then , sir , do you wish me to speak freely to you ? continued d artagnan , with his frank expression .: 15.15
<S> and now , he exclaimed , remembering the tale of the arabian fisherman , which faria had related to him , now , open sesame ! chapter 24 .: 48.99
<S> follow the culprit s steps ; he first kills m. de saint me ran oh , doctor ! i would swear to it ; what i heard of his symptoms agrees too well with what i have seen in the other cases . villefort ceased to contend ; he only groaned .: 71.85
<S> the guards , more skillful , did greater execution ; but the bourgeois , more numerous , overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron .: 81.67
<S> he has been hanged and quartered , i hope . my god , my god ! cried d artagnan , quite stunned by the relation of this horrible adventure .: 22.92
<S> i immediately put on the saddle and bridle , to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible ; then , putting the 4,500 francs into the hands of the astonished dealer , i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champs e lyse es .: 46.84
<S> suppose we warn the masters . let s wait for grimaud . but perhaps they have killed him . grimaud would have cried out . you know he is almost dumb . we should have heard the blow , then . but if he doesn t return ? here he is . at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid , his eyes staring wide open with terror , so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing , with a large circle of white around them .: 64.49
<S> the pope and c sar borgia first found the two future cardinals ; they were giovanni rospigliosi , who held four of the highest dignities of the holy see , and c sar spada , one of the noblest and richest of the roman nobility ; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope .: 63.28
<S> he remained , therefore , mute and motionless , hardly venturing to breathe .: 34.97
<S> meanwhile , sir , watch always watch carefully , for perhaps the evil may not stop here .: 144.12
<S> the bandage fell from his eyes , and he understood the joke , which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before .: 36.23
<S> in proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts , lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor .: 71.78
<S> but they are calling me .: 64.52
<S> meanwhile , athos , in his concealment , waited in vain the signal to recommence his work .: 51.76
<S> are you going to rejoin your cardinal ?: 23.50
<S> oh , come , gentlemen , my master is ill ! the three friends hastened toward d artagnan , who , instead of being ill , ran toward his horse .: 22.46
<S> come , my friend , come , let me embrace you .: 14.16
<S> the devil ! murmured he , between his teeth .: 15.65
<S> she entered the apartment , and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much , saluted him without any girlish awkwardness , or even lowering her eyes , and with an elegance that redoubled the count s attention .: 35.04
<S> you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude .: 89.78
<S> it is well , madame , said mazarin ; nothing can gainsay such testimony . sir , replied the queen , closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it , if there is anything to be said , it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved me that i have given nothing to that gallant officer , d artagnan , you were speaking of just now , but my hand to kiss and this diamond . as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger .: 33.56
<S> well ! replied la ramee , your supper is ordered . ah !: 23.42
<S> like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor , so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse .: 133.95
<S> well , replied milady , after a moment of silence , from the present time , cease to talk of impossibilities . do not overwhelm me with happiness , cried d artagnan , throwing himself on his knees , and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to him .: 27.40
<S> is the baroness at home ? inquired danglars .: 21.43
<S> one last favor , my lord ! said he to the baron .: 29.29
<S> a woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him .: 47.78
<S> if there is any left ! murmured he .: 67.60
<S> yes , sire , interrupted aramis , raising his voice , bishop juxon , the faithful knight of christ , obedient to your majesty s wishes . charles clasped his hands , amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners , without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them , thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king .: 63.81
<S> but , he said , mouston is not so young as he was , my dear fellow ; besides , he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service . that may be true , replied porthos ; but i am used to him , and besides , he wouldn t be willing to let me go without him , he loves me so much . oh , blind self love ! thought d artagnan .: 37.98
<S> come , shall we take our luncheon , and then pay a last visit to st. peter s ? franz silently assented ; and the following afternoon , at half past five o clock , the young men parted .: 52.81
<S> here , said milady , rising with the majesty of a queen , here , felton , behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl , the victim of the brutality of a villain .: 45.02
<S> adieu , faltered the count , who felt his heart die away within him ; adieu , and think of me . oh !: 43.62
<S> and madame de villefort have just left this room , have they not ? yes . and it was they who told you something which made you angry ?: 42.04
<S> doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath .: 101.27
<S> the journey at two o clock in the morning , our four adventurers left paris by the barrie re st. denis .: 26.31
<S> bonacieux , of whom his head , if not his heart , was already full .: 76.29
<S> d avrigny continued to look at noirtier ; he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round , his cheeks turn pale and tremble ; the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead .: 41.69
<S> but , said he , first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now . noirtier s expression could not be understood .: 36.65
<S> i remember that at the castle of rueil the cardinal richelieu had some horrible oubliettes constructed . oh !: 83.04
<S> mademoiselle de villefort prepared all the cooling draughts which madame de saint me ran took , and madame de saint me ran is dead .: 26.63
<S> you see i am calm and strong .: 21.82
<S> milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king .: 101.28
<S> once arrived at the brink of the river , should we even find them three ranks deep , as long as you and your regiment do your duty , we will look to the rest . to horse ! said lord winter .: 70.59
<S> i was free at newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses .: 94.12
<S> lord de winter took a chair , drew it toward her , and sat down close beside her .: 19.68
<S> that will be four killed .: 67.55
<S> is that all , then ? in truth , my dear chevalier , you are a miracle of memory .: 22.33
<S> but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury ? the nubian smiled .: 93.74
<S> olivain ! he exclaimed , what do i see below there ? a second scream , more piercing than the first , now sounded .: 43.26
<S> it would be but an unsafe retreat .: 47.74
<S> the carriage stopped at the door of the palace .: 7.61
<S> they went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for them a cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party ; he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some one .: 78.84
<S> she had still her nymph like form , so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl who had jumped , with anne of austria , over the moat of the tuileries in 1563 .: 105.13
<S> he was a strong minded , upright young man .: 34.00
<S> if an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of milady , he would take him , in the mental disposition in which he now found himself , for a messenger sent by the devil .: 55.23
<S> ho ! replied aramis .: 14.49
<S> is he still one of the seventeen peers of france ? he is dead , sir ; a great loss .: 29.78
<S> now , will you make me a report of all that has happened ? why , i have related the events to you .: 21.67
<S> i have asked the headsman of bethune , he said , his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and grief .: 33.38
<S> in five minutes bazin made his appearance , looking in every direction to see if he were observed , but he saw no one .: 27.74
<S> nobody knows who she is , or where she comes from .: 78.90
<S> i do not mean that for you , blacas , continued louis xviii .: 23.15
<S> he fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being removed .: 18.00
<S> still ? always !: 175.11
<S> he was calm ; but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage .: 37.59
<S> the cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman , has his letters stolen from him by means of a traitor , a brigand , a rascal has , with the help of this spy and thanks to this correspondence , chalais s throat cut , under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry monsieur to the queen !: 77.64
<S> he carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in england the ambassadors of denmark , who had taken their leave , and the regular ambassador of holland , who was to take back to the port of flushing the indian merchantmen of which charles i. had made restitution to the united provinces .: 67.64
<S> although the cardinal was often tormented by fear , he was more often in need of counsel and information , and he was therefore sufficiently accessible .: 60.69
<S> your relative left la rochelle for england during the night .: 97.23
<S> go ; make out my bill and notify my servant . what , monsieur , will you leave us so soon ? you know that very well , as i gave my order to saddle my horse .: 45.45
<S> if the supreme being has directed the fatal blow , said emmanuel , it must be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past lives of these people to merit mitigation of their awful punishment . do you not form a very rash judgment , emmanuel ? said julie .: 102.21
<S> but , replied the owner , glancing after dante s , who was watching the anchoring of his vessel , it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say , danglars , to understand his business , for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly , and not to require instruction from anyone . yes , said danglars , darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate .: 52.53
<S> milady had told the truth her head was confused , for her ill arranged plans clashed one another like chaos .: 142.43
<S> everything was as we have said , a question of arithmetic to cocles , and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude , that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment , as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow .: 73.92
<S> one of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal barge near , and by its light they examined the weapons .: 60.97
<S> reflect upon it . d artagnan did reflect , and resolved to thrash planchet provisionally ; which he did with the conscientiousness that d artagnan carried into everything .: 134.71
<S> yes , replied noirtier .: 9.89
<S> you have ill understood , wrongly interpreted ; i did not mean to say silence , silence ! cried the duke .: 64.93
<S> creating the works from print editions not protected by u.s. copyright law means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works , so the foundation and you !: 24.03
<S> he judged that the match would be so much the less equal , if athos and his companions were really plotting ; and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command , all his anger faded away into a smile .: 54.14
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> fortunately , he fancied that dante s was delirious ; and placing the food on the rickety table , he withdrew .: 36.36
<S> your horses are ready saddled in their stables , are they not ? he said , turning to d artagnan .: 16.24
<S> monsieur , said athos , placing his hand on d artagnan s shoulder , monsieur is the chevalier d artagnan of whom you have often heard me speak , raoul . monsieur , said the young man , saluting again and more profoundly , monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman . that little compliment could not fail to move d artagnan .: 33.84
<S> they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur , he said .: 16.33
<S> nothing was changed .: 41.96
<S> but , said danglars , there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs ? oh , a mere nothing , said monte cristo .: 17.06
<S> it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had for a cause the danger which mme .: 94.07
<S> it could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness ; for in truth he only drank to combat this sadness , which wine however , as we have said , rendered still darker .: 52.55
<S> unhappy he , who , on the brink of misfortune , broods over ideas like these !: 140.49
<S> i wish to see him at once . ah , said the jailer , do not always brood over what is impossible , or you will be mad in a fortnight . you think so ? yes ; we have an instance here ; it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbe became mad , who was in this chamber before you . 0119m how long has he left it ? two years . was he liberated , then ? no ; he was put in a dungeon . listen ! said dante s .: 48.58
<S> confess , monsieur mordaunt , that you are anxious to kill some of us . all , replied mordaunt .: 29.81
<S> yes , said monte cristo ; has it not been agreed that i should take you with me , and did i not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure ? i am ready , said maximilian ; i came expressly to wish them farewell . whither are you going , count ? asked julie .: 26.15
<S> then , said he , you are ready to pay the official visits , which are absolutely indispensable ? yes , replied euge nie .: 23.48
<S> it was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passers by ; but as against the side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length , and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty , these passers by repressed their hilarity , or if hilarity prevailed over prudence , they endeavored to laugh only on one side , like the masks of the ancients .: 86.71
<S> call madame de villefort ! wake madame de villefort ! cried the procureur from the door of his chamber , which apparently he scarcely dared to leave .: 27.32
<S> yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me , that i shall , on compulsion , consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness .: 130.71
<S> but , my dear love , reflect a little upon what you require of me .: 33.41
<S> hush ! said athos .: 10.47
<S> expiation notwithstanding the density of the crowd , m. de villefort saw it open before him .: 50.72
<S> i must live henceforth without rank and fortune , and to begin this hard apprenticeship i must borrow from a friend the loaf i shall eat until i have earned one .: 95.49
<S> debray paused a moment before reading , as if trying to guess its contents , or perhaps while making up his mind how to act , whatever it might contain .: 89.12
<S> your spanish wine is excellent .: 54.11
<S> well , if any misfortune happen to me , replied monte cristo , i wish my daughter to be happy . hayde e smiled sorrowfully , and shook her head .: 14.55
<S> according to the count s directions , danglars was waited on by vampa , who brought him the best wine and fruits of italy ; then , having conducted him to the road , and pointed to the post chaise , left him leaning against a tree .: 38.90
<S> he remained silent , his eyes fixed upon the light ; the boat went on , but the prisoner thought only of merce de s .: 22.89
<S> my dear landlady , said d artagnan , i beg to introduce to you your brother , who is arrived from flanders and whom i am going to take into my service . my brother ? wish your sister good morning , master peter . wilkom , suster , said planchet .: 42.36
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> m. andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the marquis bartolomeo and the marchioness oliva corsinari .: 50.00
<S> in order to meet the payments then due ; he had collected all his resources , and , fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity , he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wife s and daughter s jewels and a portion of his plate .: 77.23
<S> the passengers and their relations crowded on the deck , friends taking a tender but sorrowful leave of each other , some weeping , others noisy in their grief , the whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who witnessed similar sights daily , but which had no power to disturb the current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of maximilian from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay .: 80.91
<S> it is impossible that your majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my brother . the king , attacked in a manner so direct , did not know what to answer ; and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fe te .: 38.27
<S> this brought them , by the end of the repast , to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale topaz .: 90.81
<S> d artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away , and that he had committed an error .: 18.95
<S> i come to say that today , and for the remainder of the carnival , i leave the carriage entirely at your disposal .: 28.66
<S> if the thing were to do again , i would again do it . villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement .: 30.27
<S> you see that everything is to our advantage . yes , said d artagnan ; but we shall indubitably attract a ball . well , my dear , replied athos , you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are not from the enemy . but for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our muskets . you are stupid , friend porthos .: 51.00
<S> baptistin will tell you where , if you do not know their address .: 37.99
<S> penelon put his hand over his eyes , and then stared at the man who thus criticized the man uvres of his captain .: 37.26
<S> are they all full ? grimaud translated the question , and groslow , who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead , answered : some full , others empty . d artagnan struck the barrels with his hand , and having ascertained that he spoke the truth , pushed his lantern , greatly to the captain s alarm , into the interstices between the barrels , and finding that there was nothing concealed in them : come along , he said ; and he went toward the door of the second compartment .: 53.11
<S> is supper ready , signor pastrini ? yes , your excellency . well , then , let us sup . but the carriage and horses ? said franz .: 23.77
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage ? i do not think that is the case . however it may be , valentine , you must not be alarmed .: 23.14
<S> evening came , and still , with all the patient solicitude of a mother , she watched for his return .: 56.04
<S> but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections , they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum , through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead .: 45.22
<S> she thought it was best to preserve silence , to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill ; and then , all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal , to come to him and claim her vengeance .: 74.58
<S> my valet , in examining this mournful relic , felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out ; it was a letter addressed to you , baron . to me ? cried danglars .: 51.44
<S> oh , murmured the count , shall i then be permitted to love again ?: 28.47
<S> he will be delivered to the parliament , members of which can , of course , be bought , but even monsieur de mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body . i think , returned anne of austria , fixing upon him a glance , which in any woman s face would have expressed disdain , but in a queen s , spread terror to those she looked upon , nay , i perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your sovereign . madame , replied d artagnan , i threaten simply and solely because i am obliged to do so .: 50.54
<S> was not faria s fate the better , after all to solve the problem of life at its source , even at the risk of horrible suffering ?: 122.70
<S> she had many a time felt humiliated by the self sacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the gascon gentleman .: 103.14
<S> you are all mistaken , gentlemen , answered athos , gravely ; you are eating horse . eating what ? said d artagnan .: 31.11
<S> one of the three will certainly be at home , perhaps all three .: 40.67
<S> well ? he said to the lieutenant .: 13.76
<S> they were the same statues , rich in form , in attraction , and poesy , with eyes of fascination , smiles of love , and bright and flowing hair .: 56.34
<S> i can just suit you . ah ! said porthos , brightening , that s well as regards my horse ; but i must have the appointments complete , as they include objects which a musketeer alone can purchase , and which will not amount , besides , to more than three hundred livres . three hundred livres ?: 66.66
<S> through this the king was to escape the next night , and , hidden by the black covering of the scaffold , was to change his dress for that of a workman , slip out with his deliverers , pass the sentinels , who would suspect nothing , and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at greenwich .: 61.95
<S> follow me , sir ; and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance .: 60.98
<S> he s well guarded now ; we only said he would escape . who said so ? repeat your story , saint laurent , replied the man , turning to the originator of the tale .: 60.68
<S> aramis made a bound , seized the letter , read it , or rather devoured it , his countenance radiant .: 51.62
<S> i saw then that we were descending a large staircase ; around us were all my mother s servants carrying trunks , bags , ornaments , jewels , purses of gold , with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction .: 64.19
<S> i will make verses , said he .: 15.20
<S> felton was then mistrusted .: 61.03
<S> not even me ? asked the count with deep emotion .: 39.51
<S> m. de tre ville entered the king s cabinet boldly , and found his majesty in a very ill humor , seated on an armchair , beating his boot with the handle of his whip .: 29.88
<S> ah , there you are , marechal , cried anne of austria joyfully .: 26.13
<S> the idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind , and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before .: 41.65
<S> with anne of austria for that affair was over but he had to adjust matters for m. de bassompierre , who was embroiled with the duc d angoule me .: 56.95
<S> ah , noble fellow ! cried he .: 16.12
<S> locusta and agrippina , living at the same time , were an exception , and proved the determination of providence to effect the entire ruin of the roman empire , sullied by so many crimes .: 64.20
<S> no , it is not finished ; i feel it by what remains in my heart .: 37.89
<S> we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy , and follow the baroness , who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her , had gone to seek her usual adviser , lucien debray .: 76.65
<S> tis a comfort , said the gascon , since we shall not die of thirst .: 29.98
<S> well , said beauchamp , let them now say that drama is unnatural ! ma foi ! said cha teau renaud , i would rather end my career like m. de morcerf ; a pistol shot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe . and moreover , it kills , said beauchamp .: 60.06
<S> but as there was nothing positively certain in this report , the young warriors decided to continue their way toward bethune , free on the road to diverge to the right and march to carvin if necessary .: 61.57
<S> don t worry , dear grandpapa , said she , endeavoring to smile ; it is nothing it is nothing ; i was giddy , that is all . another attack of giddiness , said morrel , clasping his hands .: 27.11
<S> caderousse quickly performed the stranger s bidding ; and after pouring some into a glass , and slowly swallowing its contents , the abbe , resuming his usual placidity of manner , said , as he placed his empty glass on the table : where did we leave off ? the name of edmond s betrothed was merce de s. to be sure .: 69.70
<S> ay , that will do at armentie res . where is that armentie res ? a little town on the lys ; i shall only have to cross the river , and i shall be in a foreign country . capital !: 34.61
<S> he is in a hurry ! 40190m these words restored albert ; he darted from the room , followed by the count .: 28.22
<S> juxon was waiting for him impatiently .: 27.42
<S> you are right , athos , said aramis ; and it is a rather difficult matter .: 17.43
<S> the president resumed : i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha .: 24.57
<S> yes , i share your hopes ; the anger of heaven will not pursue us , since you are pure and i am innocent .: 43.15
<S> determined to bear it no longer , she arose and left the room ; saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance .: 69.60
<S> the count s serious face was illumined by a faint smile , as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver general held in his hand .: 49.51
<S> he labored and toiled until he had amassed 250,000 francs ; six years sufficed to achieve this object .: 90.36
<S> as for porthos , on whom d artagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend , which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos , he was simply mute .: 41.63
<S> just so . why , he is a second ariosto . no , his name is the count of monte cristo . there is no count of monte cristo said debray .: 21.55
<S> i remember now . milady looked around her , as if in search of something .: 27.08
<S> barrois , who wished to go to bed himself , observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest .: 80.21
<S> shall we obey ? asked blaisois .: 21.07
<S> i predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and routs .: 123.68
<S> to be sure ! answered danglars .: 20.99
<S> who occupies number 3 ? the little fellow who arrived last night in a post chaise with his sister , and who asked for an apartment with two beds . the bell here rang for the third time , with another shriek of anguish .: 90.09
<S> but why should i meddle in the matter ?: 24.57
<S> you have not forgotten st. gervais , athos , and the napkin which was converted into a banner ? and he then related to raoul the story of the bastion , and raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry , so gloriously recounted by tasso and ariosto .: 67.22
<S> hold , continued d artagnan , turning toward the door , which had just opened , here is monsieur du vallon , who comes with his coat torn . yes , but in exchange , said porthos , covered with perspiration and soiled by dust , in exchange , i have torn many skins .: 35.94
<S> it appears the conquerors had something else to do . well ? well , we shall find their muskets , their cartridges , and their flasks ; and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls , we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire . oh , athos ! said aramis , truly you are a great man . porthos nodded in sign of agreement .: 54.23
<S> is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting ?: 35.12
<S> seek not to console me ; alas , nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow the wound is too deep and too fresh !: 141.82
<S> andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes , but still it was an outlet , and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation .: 44.03
<S> all i ask is permission to remain abed . would you like to have a physician called ? said the woman .: 59.49
<S> m. cavalcanti remained master of the field .: 53.39
<S> mousqueton collected a store of crusts ; bazin , who had always been inclined to devotion , never quit the churches ; planchet watched the flight of flies ; and grimaud , whom the general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master , heaved sighs enough to soften the stones .: 102.24
<S> the guards of monsieur the cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them , and for the honor of the corps even , the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves . listen to monsieur de tre ville , said the king ; listen to him !: 31.35
<S> ah , my poor friends ! murmured d artagnan ; where are you ?: 13.76
<S> it was agreed that milady should wait for felton till ten o clock ; if he did not return by ten o clock she was to sail .: 28.20
<S> but the presence of this woman did not prevent milady from thinking .: 27.68
<S> yes .: 18.24
<S> morrel was seen carrying , with superhuman strength , the armchair containing noirtier upstairs .: 213.03
<S> lead me into the queen s oratory , said d artagnan , announce to her i am here , and put this parcel , with a well loaded musket , under the seat of the carriage which is waiting at the foot of the private stair . bernouin conducted d artagnan to the oratory , where he sat down pensively .: 37.33
<S> doctor , do you hear them call for help ? yes , yes ; let us hasten up ; it was in valentine s room . but before the doctor and the father could reach the room , the servants who were on the same floor had entered , and seeing valentine pale and motionless on her bed , they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed , as though struck by lightening .: 40.93
<S> he is the evil genius of both of us .: 45.65
<S> something bright . i , too , cried mousqueton , saw them also . ah !: 79.04
<S> i know it . and now the ranks began to open .: 34.61
<S> beware of giving anyone the clue to your griefs ; the curious suck our tears as flies suck the blood of a wounded hart . alas , my dear aramis , said d artagnan , in his turn heaving a profound sigh , that is my story you are relating ! how ? yes ; a woman whom i love , whom i adore , has just been torn from me by force .: 56.57
<S> yes , that first , and other things afterward . speak . it is a thing of the highest interest , and upon which our future fortune perhaps depends . the complexion of our fortune has changed very much since i saw you , madame bonacieux , and i should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many folks . yes , particularly if you follow the instructions i am about to give you . me ? yes , you .: 58.56
<S> as to myself , i shall go around to see athos ; for though i don t think his aid worth much , one must with one s friends observe all due politeness , said d artagnan .: 79.55
<S> that was the reason why i left my chateau du vallon near corbeil , and came to my estate , bracieux .: 37.54
<S> but as i can not , and you will not , quit this place , it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier s gallery ; he might , by chance , hear the hollow sound of his footsteps , and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance .: 55.98
<S> there was nothing but felicitations , pressures of the hand , and embraces ; there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the rochellais .: 62.26
<S> that a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it , had answered for its future , and had taken it away . that was true . ah !: 39.42
<S> who can possibly have told you i had had that dream ?: 77.85
<S> i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m. noirtier ; i will suffer , without complaint , the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me ; but i shall remain firm in my determination , and the world shall see which party has reason on his side .: 82.66
<S> come do you know of what the count of monte cristo is capable ?: 21.76
<S> i am lost , said he .: 8.22
<S> it is a misfortune , and government owes nothing to his family .: 28.94
<S> five millions a pretty sum , eh , peppino ? hush here is our man ! the clerk seized his pen , and peppino his beads ; one was writing and the other praying when the door opened .: 88.03
<S> she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress , and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather .: 68.92
<S> what do you say to it , aramis ? why , the idea of taking quarters with senor perez seems to me very reasonable , and for my part i agree to it .: 43.34
<S> it was therefore near seven o clock ; but edmond s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head .: 56.19
<S> but , said he , as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches of kitty , i must not play the fool .: 33.59
<S> felton , in his turn a suppliant , clasped his hands .: 23.97
<S> the carriage passed under two arched gateways , and at length stopped in a court large , dark , and square .: 55.51
<S> she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her request to the captain , who , on his part , took care not to remind her of it .: 46.97
<S> the man he addressed recoiled with terror , and only answered the few words of the musketeer by pointing .: 64.47
<S> i have two things to postpone . and what are they ? first , a thrust with the coadjutor , whom i met last night at madame de rambouillet s and whom i found particular in his remarks respecting me . oh , fie a quarrel between priests , a duel between allies ! what can i do , friend ?: 76.72
<S> let us go , said he ; it is five minutes past seven , and the appointment was for eight o clock . a carriage was in readiness at the door .: 16.16
<S> this morning you rose at five o clock ; you must stand in need of repose .: 37.01
<S> she loved porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus ; she made him a sign to dismount and come to her .: 43.95
<S> my dear m. d artagnan , the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands . he paused .: 19.86
<S> each moment s delay is an eternity for me .: 101.42
<S> we were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke .: 41.48
<S> empty your pockets , said he ; i want a hundred pounds , and as for my own and he emptied them inside out .: 53.97
<S> as soon as he took to flight every one pursued him , until , pressed on all sides , scarron found no way of escaping his escort , except by throwing himself into the river ; but the water was icy cold .: 78.97
<S> andrea , who had often stayed there in his rides about paris , recollected the bell and bottle inn ; he turned around , saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp , and having dismissed the child , giving him all the small coin he had about him , he began knocking at the door , very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper .: 79.37
<S> the men of my crew , who are devoted to me for life and death , mount guard around this apartment , and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard .: 54.58
<S> she loves him ; it was for his sake she has committed these crimes .: 40.73
<S> this measure somewhat reassured bonacieux .: 209.13
<S> there now , said euge nie , while i change my costume do you lock the portmanteau . louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands on the top of the portmanteau .: 51.54
<S> you are insane , monsieur . monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting . and d artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady , and which he had given to d artagnan to serve him as a safeguard .: 47.90
<S> the accusation m. d avrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness , who had looked like a second corpse in that chamber of death .: 82.26
<S> they want to arrest master broussel ! he cried ; the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs ! the crowd began to murmur and approached the house .: 47.90
<S> the host was alone , seated before his desk , one of the drawers of which was partly open .: 33.87
<S> of that which i am ready to feel toward you . and what is that proof ? are you willing that i should this evening pass with you the time i generally spend with your mistress ? oh , yes , said kitty , clapping her hands , very willing . well , then , come here , my dear , said d artagnan , establishing himself in an easy chair ; come , and let me tell you that you are the prettiest soubrette i ever saw ! and he did tell her so much , and so well , that the poor girl , who asked nothing better than to believe him , did believe him .: 38.63
<S> at nine o clock the next morning , the drums beat to arms .: 21.62
<S> you are not a priest , you are a musketeer ! a musketeer for a time , my friend , as the cardinal says , a musketeer against my will , but a churchman at heart , believe me .: 32.84
<S> porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and contemplative organization , and he had brought him away without any other recommendation .: 71.34
<S> do you find the means , i will execute it , provided it is not to kill the man , for merce de s has declared she will kill herself if dante s is killed . caderousse , who had let his head drop on the table , now raised it , and looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes , he said , kill dante s !: 40.80
<S> as this was the height of d artagnan s worldly ambition apart , be it well understood , from his desire of finding mme .: 62.53
<S> to how much ? said she .: 27.19
<S> well , then , we ll do our best . having said that , they went out of the stable . well , what matters all that to us ? said d artagnan .: 24.61
<S> i command thee ! said the duke .: 17.26
<S> the corsican , who had declared the vendetta against me , who had followed me from ni mes to paris , who had hid himself in the garden , who had struck me , had seen me dig the grave , had seen me inter the child , he might become acquainted with your person , nay , he might even then have known it .: 43.15
<S> you were wishing just now , said villefort , addressing her , that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer .: 48.55
<S> this time the devil himself shall not save them , rejoined mordaunt .: 60.95
<S> an instant after , the boat , rowed by two men , advanced rapidly towards him .: 32.98
<S> ma foi ! he said , i prefer waiting till tomorrow .: 22.95
<S> how , madame , said she , i have scarcely seen you , and you already wish to deprive me of your company , upon which i had counted a little , i must confess , for the time i have to pass here ? no , madame , replied the novice , only i thought i had chosen my time ill ; you were asleep , you are fatigued . well , said milady , what can those who sleep wish for a happy awakening ?: 33.32
<S> in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot .: 64.45
<S> will you have the goodness , sir , should you receive news from blois , to send me a few lines about my little friend mademoiselle de la valliere , about whose health , when we left , so much anxiety was felt ?: 64.35
<S> will this promise be fulfilled , m. noirtier ? asked morrel , while d avrigny looked inquiringly .: 27.68
<S> d artagnan and his companions remembered their audience , and as they would very much have regretted that such an opportunity should be lost , they succeeded in calming their friends , who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates ; but the gates were too strong .: 52.36
<S> you are looking for my daughter ? said the baroness , smiling .: 14.53
<S> yes , looked the old man .: 18.17
<S> a man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning ; but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly .: 66.30
<S> d artagnan , keeping at some distance from his friends , darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared , but saw no face with which he was acquainted .: 51.43
<S> my first impressions were favorable to the minister ; i said to myself that a minister is never loved , but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared , which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved d artagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim .: 70.12
<S> therefore , in spite of olivain s remarks , he continued to urge his steed more and more , and following a pleasant little path , leading to a ferry , and which he had been assured shortened the journey by the distance of one league , he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him .: 43.49
<S> thinking that porthos will be at last a baron , and d artagnan a captain .: 45.50
<S> the king is alone with a few gentlemen , whom he fears to lose every day ; surrounded by the scotch , whom he distrusts , although he be himself a scotchman .: 65.31
<S> he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice . men fear him and spare him . i , said felton , i do not fear him , nor will i spare him . the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal joy .: 108.87
<S> listen , hermine ; i consider myself as brave as most men , but when i drew from my breast the little key of the staircase , which i had found in my coat that little key we both used to cherish so much , which you wished to have fastened to a golden ring when i opened the door , and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre , i leaned against the wall , and nearly shrieked .: 54.30
<S> what do you demand ? that thou shalt soon know , shouted a chorus of horsemen .: 69.27
<S> do you think of dying , my lord ? said she .: 9.84
<S> de salvieux , my brother s chamberlain ? yes , sire . he is at marseilles . and writes me thence . does he speak to you of this conspiracy ? no ; but strongly recommends m. de villefort , and begs me to present him to your majesty . m .: 32.57
<S> the aperture was finished and athos passed through it , carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth , and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the king s room .: 45.56
<S> at the foot of the stairs , valentine found barrois awaiting her .: 20.05
<S> as for me , i have almost forgotten the little latin i have ever known .: 22.14
<S> her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor ; her beauty serves as a bait to her victims ; her body even pays what she promises i must do her that justice .: 176.97
<S> d artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger , as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner , to whom this man had confided some important missive .: 45.00
<S> england needs tranquillity at home , in order to consummate the expulsion of her king ; france needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch .: 90.32
<S> there was something mournful , solemn , and terrible in the count s manner .: 20.91
<S> besides , the parisian world is entirely unknown to me , for , as i believe i told you , i have been in paris but very few days .: 27.49
<S> but d artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried , wait ! athos stopped .: 33.51
<S> as for me , i hate the court and have but one desire at this moment vengeance .: 39.63
<S> is he afraid of me or of his father ?: 41.88
<S> p.s . do pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte cristo at your house .: 58.86
<S> what scotch ? ours , egad ! exclaimed athos .: 39.20
<S> so far , then , said danglars , mentally , all has gone as i would have it .: 38.07
<S> i had left bearn when it arrived and i never received it until the month of april , 1647 ; and as the invitation was for september , 1646 , i couldn t accept it .: 72.50
<S> he s one of my most intimate friends . one of your friends ! cried porthos , this butcher of unarmed farmers ! hush !: 38.46
<S> the recent events , the solitary and eccentric position of the count , his enormous , nay , almost incredible fortune , should have made men cautious , and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them ; and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum .: 108.49
<S> still further , the sea , very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast , destroyed every day some little vessel ; and the shore , from the point of l aiguillon to the trenches , was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles , roberges , and feluccas .: 74.74
<S> the poor girl , under the caresses of d artagnan , lifted her head .: 13.19
<S> how , my fault ? yes , i offered you escape . by pulling out a bar and pushing down a door ? certainly . porthos , men like us can t go out from here purely and simply . faith ! said porthos , as for me , i could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much . d artagnan shrugged his shoulders .: 57.35
<S> he had noticed that a few rays , not of daylight , but from a lamp , penetrated through the ill joined planks of the door ; he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy , which , owing to the leathern bottle containing it , sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars .: 64.53
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> ah , my dear fellow , said he to franz ; you did not see ? what ? there , that calash filled with roman peasants . no . well , i am convinced they are all charming women . how unfortunate that you were masked , albert , said franz ; here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments . oh , replied he , half laughing , half serious ; i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other . but , in spite of albert s hope , the day passed unmarked by any incident , excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants .: 52.45
<S> you alone forewarned us of the evil ; now try and aid us with the remedy . sire , said villefort , the usurper is detested in the south ; and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south , it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against him . yes , assuredly , replied the minister ; but he is advancing by gap and sisteron . advancing he is advancing ! said louis xviii .: 38.94
<S> as a further precaution they had bound his hands .: 86.51
<S> monsieur d artagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to live .: 41.27
<S> a vision chapter xl .: 52.79
<S> at length a sense of dignity prevailed , and if she did not entirely master her agitation , she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single tear .: 62.47
<S> one night , however , i heard his sobs , and i could not resist my desire to go up to him , but when i reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying .: 34.59
<S> as soon as she was gone , noirtier made a sign to morrel to take the dictionary .: 16.72
<S> convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine , grimaud hastened to awake d artagnan , who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place .: 53.80
<S> he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed .: 43.20
<S> just as they were beginning , in the english fashion , to leave the spoons in their cups , the door again opened and danglars entered , visibly agitated .: 50.31
<S> i suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure .: 156.62
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> my horses , said monte cristo .: 17.70
<S> that s well madame ; and there is an old proverb that says , traveling trains youth . my faith !: 124.79
<S> well , they have gone to fetch her , no doubt , from madame de morcerf s ; i will await her return , and beg her to come up here .: 27.25
<S> during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort , monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms , lavishing on him the most tender endearments .: 58.72
<S> it may be observed that at the very moment when , thanks to the ray of the sun , he perceived the gun barrel , he was thinking with astonishment on the forbearance of his eminence with respect to him .: 25.24
<S> porthos was the first to speak .: 17.29
<S> the king was dull and appeared ill , which detracted a little from his usual lofty bearing .: 109.12
<S> the first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as winter re entered it .: 49.06
<S> i am very fortunate , added he , looking gratefully at villefort , to be examined by such a man as you ; for this envious person is a real enemy . and by the rapid glance that the young man s eyes shot forth , villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness .: 51.24
<S> truly , she might have thought of you at home . i have no fear of that ; or , if she did , it was only in the same way in which i think of her . touching sympathy !: 39.54
<S> go ! do you hear ? said villefort , while d avrigny advanced to lead morrel out .: 47.20
<S> i would die willingly for the king , but supposing i happened to be killed on account of mazarin , as your nephew came near being to day , there could be nothing in paradise , however well placed i might be there , that could console me for it . well , well , monsieur de villequier , mazarin interposed , i shall make it my care the king hears of your loyalty .: 66.04
<S> barrois will open the door for you , said valentine , addressing morrel .: 29.55
<S> go into the grotto and dress yourself . at these words he drew away the stone , and showed teresa the grotto , lighted up by two wax lights , which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror ; on a rustic table , made by luigi , were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins , and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume .: 56.43
<S> faria smiled .: 28.53
<S> come , come , gentlemen , remove the fellow . and d artagnan pushed the half stupefied mercer among the guards , saying to him , you are a shabby old fellow , my dear .: 45.25
<S> explain to me .: 29.94
<S> we are not children .: 29.20
<S> every one stood up .: 40.80
<S> he can turn his coat inside out . you are always in the right , my dear friend , cried porthos ; but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice ? d artagnan smiled .: 33.13
<S> the soldiers , who knew only their orders , attempted to force him along .: 40.04
<S> the ballet at length came to a close , and the curtain fell amid the loud , unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience .: 55.77
<S> i felt my strength fail , and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail , but my swoon . felton listened without uttering any word or sound , except an inward expression of agony .: 71.37

<S> carlini flew joyfully to rita , telling her she was saved , and bidding her write to her father , to inform him what had occurred , and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres .: 64.53
<S> the sweat streamed down his marble forehead , and his hand , under his coat , tore his breast .: 29.15
<S> i tried to pray , but my tongue was frozen .: 29.25

<S> she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately i think proper to give the signal .: 69.66

<S> a woman , about six months after , came to claim it with the other half of the napkin .: 40.72
<S> there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused .: 22.82
<S> so , then , they have paid my ransom ? no , your excellency . well , then , how am i free ? a person to whom i can refuse nothing has come to demand you . come hither ? yes , hither . really ?: 39.40
<S> he then began to ascend the path .: 19.94
<S> before daybreak he would awake , leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill , and reaching the forest , he would , under pretence of making studies in painting , test the hospitality of some peasants , procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet , casting off the lion s skin to assume that of the woodman ; then , with his hands covered with dirt , his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb , his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe , he intended , by following the wooded districts , to reach the nearest frontier , walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries , and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time .: 100.65
<S> enough ? asked m. de tre ville .: 14.97

<S> m. de tre ville employed this powerful weapon for the king , in the first place , and the friends of the king and then for himself and his own friends .: 23.07
<S> be on the qui vive ! cried d artagnan .: 22.96
<S> the duke went indoors and retired to bed , where he spent , indeed , the greater part of every day , as they had taken his books away .: 40.62

<S> i have them at hand , monsieur . porthos , take yours from your holsters . i have them . good ! said d artagnan , seizing his own ; now you understand , porthos ? not too well . we are out on the king s service . well ? for the king s service we need horses . that is true , said porthos .: 26.64
<S> we can not leave you here so , and yet we can not stay . go , go ! exclaimed dante s .: 23.43

<S> the night passed in perfect silence .: 37.97
<S> unlimited credit about two o clock the following day a calash , drawn by a pair of magnificent english horses , stopped at the door of monte cristo and a person , dressed in a blue coat , with buttons of a similar color , a white waistcoat , over which was displayed a massive gold chain , brown trousers , and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his features a person , in a word , who , although evidently past fifty , desired to be taken for not more than forty , bent forwards from the carriage door , on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron , and directed his groom to inquire at the porter s lodge whether the count of monte cristo resided there , and if he were within .: 64.46
<S> the agent of thomson french had not been again seen at marseilles ; the day after , or two days after his visit to morrel , he had disappeared ; and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor , the inspector of prisons , and m. morrel , his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three persons .: 37.98
<S> you were walking one evening in m. de villefort s garden ; from what you relate , i suppose it to have been the evening of madame de saint me ran s death .: 27.81
<S> i , of course , give him the same title , and everyone else does likewise . what a strange man you are !: 38.60
<S> that is the reply i beg you to make to lord de winter .: 21.05
<S> he was one of those fine , ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others .: 38.70
<S> the sword ! and he jumped off his horse .: 22.97
<S> he approached the other door , and taking off his hat respectfully , said , madame , will you permit me to offer you my services ?: 23.61
<S> are you not rich yourself ? my father s income is about 50,000 francs per annum ; and he will give me , perhaps , ten or twelve thousand when i marry . that , perhaps , might not be considered a large sum , in paris especially , said the count ; but everything does not depend on wealth , and it is a fine thing to have a good name , and to occupy a high station in society .: 41.52
<S> our charming gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as ever .: 94.92
<S> do that , cried she , and you will have saved my life , you will have saved my honor ! do not exaggerate the service i have the happiness to render your majesty .: 28.98
<S> she will soon pass ; she is already late .: 52.24
<S> there , seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from hartwell , and to which , from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people , he was particularly attached , the king , louis xviii. , was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty two years of age , with gray hair , aristocratic bearing , and exceedingly gentlemanly attire , and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of gryphius s rather inaccurate , but much sought after , edition of horace a work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch .: 97.75
<S> athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned .: 56.51
<S> i had determined to make believe sup , but to eat nothing .: 66.41
<S> good , thought he ; mazarin has been listening to discover whether i betrayed him .: 41.37
<S> but what were you to do with that woman ? asked d artagnan , with anguish .: 10.20
<S> here it is , i see . at this very moment friquet passed , mounted on raoul s horse , waving his parti colored cap and crying , broussel !: 62.22
<S> edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow who had been one of his own sailors as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance .: 72.27
<S> the officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the bastille , where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their muskets .: 64.18
<S> something whispers me so , continued porthos , becoming more and more melancholy .: 68.89
<S> milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment ; then , as if appearing to have formed a resolution , she said , i have an enemy . you , madame ! said d artagnan , affecting surprise ; is that possible , my god ? good and beautiful as you are ! a mortal enemy . indeed ! an enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death .: 41.03
<S> they found him in the large armchair , which served him for a bed , enjoying a calm , nay , almost a smiling sleep .: 50.57
<S> eh , your excellency ?: 31.08
<S> he pointed his finger to the lighted window .: 29.18
<S> neither am i , said porthos .: 26.26
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> there is a horse , while on the contrary , the hundred pistoles feed their master . but how shall we get back ? upon our lackey s horses , pardieu .: 36.97
<S> to me , sir ? said he .: 9.07
<S> kitty came in , but milady was very cross with her .: 55.84
<S> it must have been for his hide , for , certes , the carcass is not worth eighteen livres .: 57.85
<S> i can not calmly say with you , providence has struck the blow ; but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred , and when i have found him i shall kill him , or he will kill me .: 43.28
<S> if you heard the cry of mad dog ! you would take your gun you would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast , who , after all , was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog .: 83.08
<S> i did think of it , but this letter has neither date nor postmark . true , said porthos .: 31.23
<S> but with his simple musketeer s uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back his head and advanced his foot , athos instantly took the place which was his due and consigned the ostentatious porthos to the second rank .: 87.72
<S> but , in a word , what are you going to do ? asked she .: 9.30
<S> if i judge for myself , my lord , she said , the cardinal will do nothing , and will even , perhaps , act against us .: 30.49
<S> infamous ! said mme .: 22.05
<S> how do you mean ? said valentine , looking anxiously around .: 14.62
<S> you will not touch the garden either ; as to the yard , you may do what you please with it ; i should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition . i will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes , your excellency .: 54.82
<S> the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly expired .: 104.39

<S> the opera of parisina was announced for representation , and the principal actors were coselli , moriani , and la specchia .: 58.71
<S> m. de boville was in his private room , and the englishman , on perceiving him , made a gesture of surprise , which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence .: 14.89
<S> monsieur porthos ! cried the procurator s wife .: 8.48
<S> gendarmes , said the president , lead in the accused . at these words the public attention became more intense , and all eyes were turned towards the door through which benedetto was to enter .: 52.94
<S> all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy , between life and death , which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next a sublime spot , a resting place full of poetry and character , and at which franz had already halted five or six times , and at each time found it more marvellous and striking .: 58.96
<S> whence it came no one knew , and it spoke an unknown tongue .: 102.42
<S> the pardon chapter 117 .: 37.50
<S> d artagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the same instant , the one to recover , the other to obtain , the sword ; but d artagnan , being the more active , reached it first and placed his foot upon it .: 44.32
<S> i am dead drunk , that s all , and never did a man more strongly set about getting so .: 64.97
<S> this evening , said the governor , when the task was ended .: 21.65
<S> i say , sire , that the minister of police is greatly deceived or i am ; and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty , it is probable that i am in error .: 30.38
<S> caderousse , scarcely yet relying on this promise , put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder .: 52.74
<S> then , turning to noirtier , do you hope the assassin will be tried ? no . then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine ? yes . it is no news to you , added d avrigny , to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her ? the old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject .: 29.98
<S> m. de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars , on his left morrel .: 25.71
<S> the porter knew him , and let him pass , only calling to him : in his study , monsieur procureur in his study ! villefort pushed , or rather forced , the door open .: 54.54
<S> the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber , the furniture of which was sumptuous , and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling .: 60.41
<S> in this waiting room were five or six of the cardinal s guards , who recognized d artagnan , and knowing that it was he who had wounded jussac , they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning .: 22.13
<S> it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color , and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out , and his hand and head cut off ; the tongue the first day , the hand the second , and the head the third .: 76.90
<S> what an appetite you used to have !: 126.30

<S> ah , said the marquise de saint me ran , a woman with a stern , forbidding eye , though still noble and distinguished in appearance , despite her fifty years ah , these revolutionists , who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror , would be compelled to own , were they here , that all true devotion was on our side , since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch , while they , on the contrary , made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun ; yes , yes , they could not help admitting that the king , for whom we sacrificed rank , wealth , and station was truly our louis the well beloved , while their wretched usurper has been , and ever will be , to them their evil genius , their napoleon the accursed . am i not right , villefort ? i beg your pardon , madame .: 89.68
<S> we will discuss that subject at length some future time , said he .: 54.58
<S> aramis , whom we have sent for ! that s true , said athos ; we must wait for aramis . at that moment aramis entered .: 20.48
<S> now , really , let me ask , sir , have you ? do you believe you have anything to do ?: 22.51
<S> there is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss , at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity .: 36.07
<S> i am sorry he does not speak french , that i might tender him my compliments . i am ready to receive and return them , sir , said the officer , in pretty good french , for i resided three years in paris . then , sir , allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your man . nearly ?: 49.11
<S> when he was quite a child , and only a shepherd , i gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way , and he , in order to repay me , gave me a poniard , the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand , and which you may have seen in my collection of arms .: 32.70
<S> now , said valentine , you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden . morrel looked at her with astonishment .: 34.21
<S> stay , said monte cristo , here , in this very spot and he stamped upon the ground , i had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in , to refresh these old trees ; well , my man , digging , found a box , or rather , the iron work of a box , in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant . 30225m monte cristo felt the arm of madame danglars stiffen , while that of villefort trembled .: 57.51
<S> are the english expected by land , or do the musketeers consider themselves superior officers ? monseigneur , replied athos , for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him , monseigneur , the musketeers , when they are not on duty , or when their duty is over , drink and play at dice , and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys . lackeys ? grumbled the cardinal .: 94.79
<S> oh , yes , yes ; this instant , i entreat you . in a moment that part of the floor on which dante s was resting his two hands , as he knelt with his head in the opening , suddenly gave way ; he drew back smartly , while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed .: 46.10
<S> one may soon see that you re a soldier .: 71.96
<S> but at this sort of work , many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken .: 97.35
<S> his eminence , then , orders me said the lady .: 60.75
<S> as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong .: 88.58
<S> athos would have died rather than appeal for help ; but he could look , and with that look ask assistance .: 105.69
<S> he could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars , or refuse food and die of starvation .: 86.05
<S> at eleven o clock the mourning coaches rolled into the paved court , and the rue du faubourg saint honore was filled with a crowd of idlers , equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich , and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess .: 53.51
<S> a large vase of japan porcelain , filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume , stood in the salon .: 58.59
<S> as he rose , a flash of lightning , that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven , illumined the darkness .: 42.01
<S> then the general advanced , and making a violent effort to control his feelings , i have a son , said he , and i ought to think of him , finding myself among assassins . general , said the chief of the assembly , one man may insult fifty it is the privilege of weakness .: 50.36
<S> help ! cried he .: 14.26
<S> morrel , evidently discomposed , came to meet monte cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry .: 59.08
<S> but she was greatly embarrassed .: 43.98
<S> monsieur de beaufort told the guards who took him to vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison , and that he had found out forty ways of escaping . my lord , if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out long ago . come , come ; not such a fool as i fancied ! thought mazarin .: 58.07
<S> bonacieux took place .: 44.12
<S> it is the desire of vengeance , and how desire molds a man !: 56.46
<S> immediately , without any other signal , the carriages moved on , flowing on towards the corso , down all the streets , like torrents pent up for a while , which again flow into the parent river ; and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks .: 85.55
<S> as perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the rue de jerusalem , and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing , allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap .: 48.14
<S> for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears , and i chose the latter ; at any rate , it is a french word .: 33.95
<S> the one was a little billet , genteelly folded , with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch .: 76.89
<S> at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs , followed by the measured tread of soldiery , with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements ; then came a hum and buzz as of many voices , so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party , among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk , and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed .: 83.27
<S> monsieur de rochefort , said gondy , laughing , are you a boy to play with firearms ? rochefort recognized the voice .: 40.84
<S> the duke was the grandson of henry iv .: 16.30
<S> d artagnan s eyes sparkled with joy .: 7.16
<S> d artagnan approached quickly , making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind .: 20.66
<S> let me see ; have i not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins , and of his having had a miraculous escape ?: 83.19
<S> could never rid himself , this horse was born in the house of your father about thirteen years ago , and has remained in it ever since , which ought to make you love it .: 72.54
<S> pray , was not monsieur d artagnan , in the time of the cardinal , mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out , according to report , quite cleverly ? my lord , as to the report you allude to guitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak out i know nothing but what the public knows .: 64.72
<S> truly , it is i who am mad , and you prove to me that passion blinds the most well meaning .: 43.95
<S> i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert . and the steamboat ? she is at cha lons ? yes . the same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels . very good . when you have purchased the estate i desire , i want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road . your excellency may depend upon me . the count made a gesture of satisfaction , descended the terrace steps , and sprang into his carriage , which was whirled along swiftly to the banker s house .: 60.03
<S> i have induced you to take a charming promenade ; here is a delicious breakfast ; and yonder are five hundred persons , as you may see through the loopholes , taking us for heroes or madmen two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other . but the secret ! said d artagnan .: 87.40
<S> whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also .: 88.75
<S> i forgot that my songs are out of place in this castle .: 59.15
<S> well , but he is a charming young man , according to my ideas . he is , which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of m. noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying ; old men are always so selfish in their affection , said madame de villefort .: 36.53
<S> nothing ; and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things , when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news . yes , my lord , said athos , i wish to speak to the king . to the king !: 38.91
<S> your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france ? i am , sir , said the king , much agitated ; and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saint jacques .: 39.25
<S> at the second turn , the count stopped the carriage , and requested permission to withdraw , leaving the vehicle at their disposal .: 33.84
<S> the duke had been five years in prison , and now to him , looking back upon them , those five years , which had passed so slowly , seemed not so long a time as were the two days , the forty eight hours , which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape .: 65.79
<S> we will try and carry him on board the tartan . dante s declared , however , that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him .: 49.73
<S> i am , at least , fearful of it .: 15.73
<S> the count then looking over into the street , saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction , and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over .: 35.37
<S> never ?: 71.95
<S> how do i know ?: 12.02
<S> the door keeper was called .: 22.13
<S> at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder .: 16.68
<S> from that lucky moment scarron led a happy life , spending both income and principal .: 324.69
<S> of course you stopped at your father s ? a feeling of faintness came over villefort .: 59.85
<S> what ails you ? said he at length .: 11.84
<S> had you known this edmond dante s , of whom they spoke ? no , your excellency , i had never heard of him before , and never but once afterwards , and that was from the abbe busoni himself , when i saw him in the prison at ni mes . go on . the jeweller took the ring , and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales , he took the stone out of its setting , and weighed it carefully .: 34.49
<S> planchet met them hard by the shed .: 160.40
<S> a mass of straight black hair , defying all attempts to train or curl it , fell over his projecting forehead , and hung down to his shoulders , giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment .: 148.34
<S> i should be delighted to do so , was the reply ; but if i am not mistaken , the words in haste , are written on the envelope of the letter which i brought . you are right , said du tremblay .: 27.90
<S> laporte , said the queen , it is time for his majesty to go to bed . the king asked to remain up , having , he said , no wish to sleep ; but the queen was firm .: 34.95
<S> he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor .: 34.73
<S> yes , i recognize the voice which speaks to me in my dreams ; yes , i recognize the features of the angel who appears to me every night , crying to my soul , which can not sleep : strike , save england , save thyself for thou wilt die without having appeased god ! speak , speak ! cried felton , i can understand you now . a flash of terrible joy , but rapid as thought , gleamed from the eyes of milady .: 57.54
<S> fearing , however , to make use of any valuable piece of paper , i hesitated for a moment , then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary , which was on the table beside me , an old paper quite yellow with age , and which had served as a marker for centuries , kept there by the request of the heirs .: 48.72
<S> the moccoli , or moccoletti , are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight , and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple with , first , how to keep his own moccoletto alight ; and secondly , how to extinguish the moccoletti of others .: 131.46
<S> saddle our horses , take your carbine . whom are we going to attack , sir ? no one ; a mere matter of precaution , answered the gascon .: 45.91
<S> good day , said he .: 16.05
<S> my leave is at an end ! do you return to paris ? asked athos , quickly .: 27.52
<S> the woman screamed , and cried for help ; but her cries were soon stifled .: 61.92
<S> can i be of any use to you ? chatillon made a sign with his hand and aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock ; twas a thrust from a sword , but his cuirass turned aside the blow .: 48.99
<S> beauty has always been and always will be all powerful .: 115.77
<S> communication being closed by the war , i was in want of everything .: 69.74
<S> the steward made a gesture that signified , i do not know . the notary looked at the count with astonishment .: 22.98
<S> the duke was in full strength and beat la ramee completely .: 85.50
<S> i don t see why ; we are very comfortable in those we wear . to prevent recognition , said d artagnan .: 35.85
<S> oh , if you are struck in france , if you die in france , if i could imagine that your love for me was the cause of your death , i could not console myself ; i should run mad .: 29.39
<S> do as you think best , d artagnan . at this moment the four guards appeared at the door of the antechamber , but seeing four musketeers standing , and their swords by their sides , they hesitated about going farther .: 41.88
<S> it seems , however , that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth . still , argued caderousse , i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened ; or , at least , that i had had no hand in it .: 41.42
<S> and now , where is he gone ? inquired d artagnan .: 11.29
<S> felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three hebrews in the furnace .: 95.14
<S> he had sighed deeply , therefore , when accepting the gift of the pony from m. d artagnan the elder .: 32.15
<S> andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him .: 57.75
<S> in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of chapter xxxv .: 46.84
<S> you received a second fortune , money and tranquillity were restored to you , and you , who had been condemned to a felon s life , might live as other men .: 50.68
<S> you know i am not familiar with the french language , which you , monsieur le coadjuteur , both speak and write so well . this is a council of state , d artagnan remarked to porthos ; but we held better ones at la rochelle , with athos and aramis . at the saint gervais bastion , said porthos .: 47.27
<S> no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home ; nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows .: 115.19
<S> ah , he is not generous , neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him , for if he did , he would have perceived that i was unhappy ; and if he had been generous , seeing me sad and solitary , he would have used his influence to my advantage , and since , as you say , he resembles the sun , he would have warmed my heart with one of his life giving rays .: 48.43
<S> cha teau renaud , returned debray , you only know your dull and gloomy faubourg saint germain ; do not pay any attention to him , count live in the chausse e d antin , that s the real centre of paris . boulevard de l ope ra , said beauchamp ; the second floor a house with a balcony .: 55.57
<S> we shall see better what is going on . and then monsieur de chatillon will not come to the place royale to look for you .: 24.65
<S> they pitied the young king , who was unconsciously ruining his country , and threw all the odium of his proceedings on mazarin .: 63.90
<S> is that all ? yes , go ; but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity .: 80.86
<S> he let go the rope and fell upon his feet , without receiving any injury .: 41.83
<S> i am here because i am a soldier and have to obey orders i have taken an oath to obey , and i do obey ; but you who have taken no such oath , why are you here and what cause do you represent ? that most sacred in the world , said athos ; the cause of misfortune , of religion , royalty .: 67.50
<S> how misfortune humbles a man ! i promise you it shall be done , answered de comminges .: 45.05
<S> he then returned with the same slow step and said : go and tell the dying man that he must be patient .: 28.77
<S> peeping out from the drapery , he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea .: 73.60
<S> fernand would have been court martialed if napoleon had remained on the throne , but his action was rewarded by the bourbons .: 67.88
<S> now , if i entreat , if i order you to live , morrel , it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life . oh , heavens , said the young man , oh , heavens what are you saying , count ?: 26.49
<S> this anxiety became so great that it even extended to aramis and porthos .: 90.52
<S> so d artagnan began : sir , he said , with desperate politeness , it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do , whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france . mordaunt did not reply .: 68.54
<S> dante s was beside himself with joy .: 16.37
<S> athos , by signs , desired grimaud to bring another bottle of wine .: 67.09
<S> well , i follow its course , i track its passage ; i adopt the wisdom of the ancients , and feel my way , for my friendship for your family and my respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my eyes ; well oh , speak , speak , doctor ; i shall have courage . well , sir , you have in your establishment , or in your family , perhaps , one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only one .: 68.72
<S> pooh ! replied porthos , i am what i am . they rode on for an hour , till the horses were covered with foam and dust .: 29.85
<S> what a scandal !: 53.80
<S> your very grateful , milady clarik that s all very simple , said d artagnan ; i expected this letter .: 35.22
<S> as for you , my dear lieutenant , i promise you nothing ; but if you bring him back to me , dead or alive , you may ask all you wish . to horse , porthos ! said d artagnan , taking his friend by the hand .: 22.17
<S> as he had said , it had been a long time since any one had needed him ; and that demand for his services on the part of mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign .: 39.74
<S> he ordered the carriage , therefore , for eleven o clock , desiring signor pastrini to inform him the moment that albert returned to the hotel .: 26.11
<S> now , since d artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen , since he was alone , since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain , no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way .: 32.66
<S> for my part , i declare , d artagnan , i think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bosom . d artagnan blushed .: 43.21
<S> for i presume it was when you left me that you went to visit her . at the hotel de ville , my dear fellow . what !: 33.90
<S> his head hanging down , his eye dull , his speech slow and painful , athos would look for hours together at his bottle , his glass , or at grimaud , who , accustomed to obey him by signs , read in the faint glance of his master his least desire , and satisfied it immediately .: 96.49
<S> alas , said milady , i know it is so .: 14.31
<S> among these two hundred levees , that of tre ville was one of the most sought .: 33.85
<S> was mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen ?: 67.61
<S> yes .: 18.24
<S> the animal uttered a cry during the transit , but , arrived at its destination , it crouched behind the cushions , and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless .: 72.59
<S> meanwhile , to his great regret , as he said , he was obliged to keep his bed .: 20.64
<S> on the entrance of the new comers , their eyes glanced from father to son , and then , naturally enough , rested on the latter , whom they began criticising .: 94.15
<S> i saw the lamp ascend , and leave me in darkness ; then i heard the well known creaking of the door although i had heard that door open but twice .: 71.83
<S> he concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majesty s command .: 51.14
<S> this portrait attracted the count of monte cristo s attention , for he made three rapid steps in the chamber , and stopped suddenly before it .: 28.52
<S> but when he saw the carriage take the way to la gre ve , when he perceived the pointed roof of the ho tel de ville , and the carriage passed under the arcade , he believed it was over with him .: 29.07
<S> i have but little influence now , but all that i have shall most assuredly be his .: 80.74
<S> five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing room were thrown open , and bertuccio appearing said , with a violent effort , the dinner waits . the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort .: 24.09
<S> going straight towards him , he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects , carefully watching the man s countenance as he did so ; but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing .: 59.02
<S> as you are my commander , it is my duty to obey . and springing backward , he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it , threw the pieces over the convent wall , and crossed his arms , whistling a cardinalist air .: 68.55
<S> mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf , on account of the ceremonial of the day , and that they would soon withdraw .: 47.50
<S> at the siege of besancon i was in the trenches .: 27.71
<S> since i have the good fortune to meet you , i beg you to receive them , and to hold me always as one of your friends . monsieur the duke , said m. de tre ville , i was so confident of your loyalty that i required no other defender before his majesty than yourself .: 31.99
<S> i read it a little while since .: 71.91
<S> why , every day in the trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that for a bullet may break a leg , and i am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head .: 99.12
<S> at the end of twelve days , after having made a splendid dinner , he reckoned his accounts , and found that he had only 50,000 francs left .: 21.63
<S> no .: 17.05
<S> is it not true , antoine ? asked the governor .: 14.81
<S> how happy you are in being exempt from all this ! well , and why should not you be free , too ?: 61.39
<S> in fact , her position was terrible .: 27.19
<S> but , said d artagnan , i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal ! ah , yes ! said aramis , toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment !: 43.78
<S> he would not take them ? said he with slight emotion .: 35.15
<S> i love most fondly i love madly i love as a man who would give his life blood to spare her a tear i love valentine de villefort , who is being murdered at this moment !: 84.99
<S> you know it is not my fault , said morrel .: 9.83
<S> which was the real delinquent ? both , sir ; one with a letter , and the other put it in the post . and where was this letter written ? at la re serve , the day before the betrothal feast . twas so , then twas so , then , murmured the abbe .: 52.41
<S> inside the cup was a small piece of paper , on which were written these words from lord ruthven to countess g . precisely ; i was sure of it , said morcerf .: 49.25
<S> la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up , but the duke remarked that it would be losing time ; and going near the rampart himself and looking over , he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat .: 61.84
<S> humph , murmured athos , it is certainly she ! and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat , he advanced toward milady .: 46.78
<S> you have known me long enough , continued albert , biting his lips convulsively , for he saw that beauchamp s anger was beginning to rise , you have been my friend , and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point . if i have been your friend , morcerf , your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title .: 52.42
<S> shall i open the secretaire ? asked valentine .: 31.37
<S> as you please , said athos .: 10.58
<S> they are contained in this box , which you will not open until you are on the other side of the channel . very well ; and you what will you do ? i i return to paris . what , without chastising this insolent boy ? asked the lady .: 40.47
<S> he is asleep . and the spanish woman ? dreaming . and the cursed italian ? he is awake , so keep on the watch , as they are gone away ; it s for some purpose , rely on it .: 70.44
<S> the violins began to sound with all their might , but nobody listened to them .: 55.65
<S> great undertakings come poorly off with paltry means . well , returned mazarin , we will satisfy you . richelieu , thought d artagnan , would have given me five hundred pistoles in advance . you will then be at my service ? asked mazarin .: 41.36
<S> but there , as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the jolly miller , without anyone host , waiter , or hostler coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse , d artagnan spied , though an open window on the ground floor , a gentleman , well made and of good carriage , although of rather a stern countenance , talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect .: 74.68
<S> i struggled , then , with all my strength , and doubtless opposed , weak as i was , a long resistance , for i heard him cry out , these miserable puritans !: 58.94
<S> my god , my lord , i have long despised thee !: 24.90
<S> valentine , will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner ? valentine rose , and saluting the count , left the apartment without speaking .: 36.50
<S> well , mademoiselle , what are you thinking about , standing there like a statue ?: 58.24
<S> for what ? said the count .: 12.12
<S> he caused me to be arrested , had me conducted hither , and placed me under your guard .: 48.97
<S> he therefore promised albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the carnival from the windows of the rospoli palace .: 53.10
<S> and yet , as you come from dax or pau from tarbes , said d artagnan .: 37.37
<S> luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind .: 98.89
<S> and as to this book , added she , pointing to the manual with her finger but without touching it , as if she must be contaminated by it , you may carry it back and make use of it yourself , for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of lord de winter the accomplice in his persecutions , the accomplice in his heresies . felton made no reply , took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested , and retired pensively .: 47.07
<S> do you not see your friends , or are you too proud to speak to them ? no , my dear fellow ! replied dante s , i am not proud , but i am happy , and happiness blinds , i think , more than pride . ah , very well , that s an explanation ! said caderousse .: 24.11
<S> coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs , and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment .: 56.98
<S> i recognized it on your finger . you bought it back , then , from monsieur des essarts ? asked porthos .: 24.40
<S> at last the half hour struck .: 22.70
<S> the day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal ; and four and twenty hours afterward i will answer for its being carried into execution .: 63.61
<S> there are ten men to accompany you .: 28.20
<S> the sailors did not wait for a second invitation ; four strokes of the oar brought them to land ; gaetano sprang to shore , exchanged a few words with the sentinel , then his comrades disembarked , and lastly came franz .: 72.89
<S> but monsieur de tre ville is a skilled physiognomist , who knows men at first sight ; and he placed you in the company of his brother in law , monsieur dessessart , leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the musketeers . monseigneur is correctly informed , said d artagnan .: 43.93
<S> and now , my dear child , adieu for the present .: 20.42
<S> what the devil !: 8.64
<S> the more this young man was superior to others , the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him .: 39.41
<S> the child went directly to him without kissing his mother .: 35.44
<S> he passes for a very charitable man .: 97.32
<S> i will say two words about it to the cardinal s esquire likewise .: 54.67
<S> you must not weep , no , you must not groan , you must tremble ! what can you mean ? asked madame danglars , shuddering .: 25.71
<S> what i hate to day i adore to morrow , and vice versa .: 97.45
<S> that woman was once a young girl , as beautiful as she is today .: 30.23
<S> this person walked along the terrace , which was ornamented with flowers .: 30.89
<S> we anchored our vessel which had a double hold , where our goods were concealed amidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the rho ne from beaucaire to arles .: 76.85
<S> now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against england will your honor give me all four of them ? take them , said cromwell .: 47.33
<S> the same flower of innocence had flourished , or was still flourishing , on their brow , that is seen on the brow of the culprit in your house . 40120m villefort shrieked , clasped his hands , and looked at the doctor with a supplicating air .: 53.29
<S> the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life , and i was immediately set at liberty . and then it was , i presume , said monte cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abbe busoni ? it was , your excellency ; the benevolent abbe took an evident interest in all that concerned me .: 39.98
<S> soubrette and mistress meantime , as we have said , despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of athos , d artagnan became hourly more in love with milady .: 74.66
<S> it was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse , who was charging at the head of the english regiment , of which , in his ardor , he was ten steps in advance .: 32.06
<S> the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor s emotion , and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features ; but they felt the sacredness of his grief , and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause , while , with instinctive delicacy , they left him to indulge his sorrow alone .: 69.34
<S> one might believe the queen was about to speak .: 20.96
<S> besides , bazin is ambitious and learned ; bazin has read history , gentlemen , he knows that sixtus the fifth became pope after having kept pigs .: 195.30
<S> all have forgiven me , some have even loved me ; but i think that god has not pardoned me , for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night i see that woman s ghost rising before me . a woman !: 66.54
<S> now , in order not to presume on this , and also to be beforehand with them , i have , if agreeable to you , thought of inviting m. and madame danglars , and m. and madame de villefort , to my country house at auteuil .: 50.00
<S> with two companions , yes , replied the duke .: 25.72
<S> what ? asked his friend .: 14.74
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> are you not the captain fernand who betrayed , sold , and murdered his benefactor , ali ?: 75.76
<S> the departure for belgium chapter 98 .: 49.01
<S> at this moment the duke s surgeon arrived , quite terrified ; he was already on board the admiral s ship , where they had been obliged to seek him .: 26.26
<S> i told her my orders from m. beauchamp ; she first extended her arms to prevent me , but after a moment s reflection , yes , go , florentin , said she , and may he come quickly . yes , my mother , said albert , i will return , and woe to the infamous wretch !: 35.75
<S> i had not yet fully recovered consciousness , when again i heard groans , mingled with half stifled cries , as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle .: 85.29
<S> the palikares , who were prostrated at my father s feet , now sprang up and fired , and the room was filled with fire and smoke .: 37.98
<S> god knows , planchet , that i should fly from a sight so sad if i did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the comte de la fere , whom we loved so much . planchet shook his head and said nothing .: 45.97
<S> at length , franz arrived at the word myself .: 59.21
<S> your misfortunes engaged his sympathies , so you see you must have been interesting .: 125.11
<S> his thin face , deeply furrowed by care , and the bold outline of his strongly marked features , betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength .: 109.24
<S> consult some politician of the period of which you speak , and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want . eh , pardieu ! said mazarin , with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money .: 72.25
<S> but fortunately this was not the case , and the governor left him , convinced that the poor madman , for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection , was only troubled with a slight indisposition .: 43.83
<S> one evening i was in a garden ; a clump of trees concealed me ; no one suspected i was there .: 43.94
<S> very well , indeed , sir , replied comminges ; at first , like you , he seemed distressed ; but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening ah ! cried d artagnan , the cardinal is about to visit the comte de la fere ? yes ; and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage of this visit to plead for you and for himself . ah !: 22.20
<S> in the first place i have as a precaution shut up at rueil , near me , under my own eyes , within reach of my hand , the two most intractable ones .: 46.39
<S> the two witnesses followed .: 26.83
<S> they knew the count s energetic and violent temper ; it must be , indeed , a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself .: 45.67
<S> his face , a little elongated , had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement .: 125.79
<S> pardon for whom ? cried he .: 49.06
<S> when his son had left him , morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door ; then putting forth his arm , he pulled the bell .: 28.40
<S> grief had made her blind to all but one object that was edmond .: 95.13
<S> my husband dines with the chancellor , replied the young lady ; he has just gone , and i am sure he ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went . two visitors who were there when the count arrived , having gazed at him with all their eyes , retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires .: 73.76
<S> i pardon you for the death of poor felton ; i pardon you for the attempts upon my own person .: 45.82
<S> the count and franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief , who drew back a bolt and opened a door .: 36.34
<S> you have one at heart , aramis , one deeper and more painful a wound made by a woman . the eye of aramis kindled in spite of himself .: 47.64
<S> he was silent for an instant , and during that time he scanned the young man even more attentively than he had done at first .: 25.71
<S> the siege of la rochelle the siege of la rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of louis xiii. , and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal .: 22.65
<S> franz himself , however , saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light , which served in some manner as a guide .: 51.46
<S> but , then your word is given . yes , doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her , but not to one who does not .: 37.56
<S> my brother is only your second husband ; and your first is still living .: 43.37
<S> when you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world , you would seem to leave a neapolitan spring for a lapland winter to quit paradise for earth heaven for hell !: 151.37
<S> everything goes on capitally , my dear monsieur bernouin , but here is a man whom i must beg you to put in a safe place . where , then , sir ? where you like , provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be locked . we have that , sir , replied bernouin ; and the poor coachman was conducted to a closet , the windows of which were barred and which looked very much like a prison .: 59.22
<S> the other was that which laporte had placed in the hands of the duke of buckingham , warning him that he was about to be assassinated ; that communication had arrived too late .: 28.35
<S> i am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request .: 30.85
<S> we were speaking of hanging . ah , you see how it is , said athos , becoming still paler , but yet attempting to laugh ; i was sure it was so the hanging of people is my nightmare . yes , yes , replied d artagnan .: 31.45
<S> the cardinal knocked three times , and in a peculiar manner .: 21.85
<S> what a life i cause you to lead , poor maximilian , you who are formed for happiness !: 110.34
<S> therefore athos had invented the phrase , family affair .: 88.10
<S> advancing a few steps toward the queen , he knelt down .: 32.99
<S> never had flora , the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners , been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure .: 91.76
<S> his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings , while , with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples .: 36.73
<S> stop a moment ; does not that sunbeam yonder , just by the side of the town , glitter on the ironsides ? this was the name given the cuirassiers , whom cromwell had made his body guard .: 77.23
<S> the box taken by albert was in the first circle ; although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic , and is , for this reason , generally styled the nobility s boxes , and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons , it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants .: 115.21
<S> strange !: 102.06
<S> how pale you are ! the abominable creature , murmured d artagnan .: 20.13
<S> porthos ventured to put his head between the railings , to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom .: 58.95
<S> it however became necessary for one of them to break it first , and as d artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion , aramis said , you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas . yes , efficacious grace has touched you , as that gentleman said just now . oh , these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time .: 67.32
<S> she is not to leave this chamber , understand , john , continued the baron .: 45.92
<S> i defended the king . and who told you to defend the king ? the comte de la fere himself . yes , the king ; but to day you have not fought for the king , you have fought for mazarin ; which is not quite the same thing . but you yourself ? oh , for me ; that is another matter .: 34.73
<S> the duc d elbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife , one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twenty five thousand for each of the three others .: 47.05
<S> as to d artagnan , he remained standing like a man in consternation , with the deepest affliction depicted on his face .: 20.34
<S> i gave the custom house officers a copy of our bill of lading ; and as to the other papers , they sent a man off with the pilot , to whom i gave them . then you have nothing more to do here ? no everything is all right now . then you can come and dine with me ? i really must ask you to excuse me , m. morrel .: 52.53
<S> you told me to open the door if i heard anyone cry out , said the soldier ; but you forgot to leave me the key .: 29.58
<S> athos played , and that as a rule unfortunately .: 113.13
<S> under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her .: 141.09
<S> so much the better !: 8.35
<S> you see , they are going to send a whole regiment against us , said athos .: 21.56
<S> we hear from yanina if valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of franz when he quitted the chamber of m. noirtier , even she would have been constrained to pity him .: 50.77
<S> i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet . oh ! answered another voice , which d artagnan instantly recognized as that of aramis .: 62.72
<S> yes , but let us understand each other , returned athos , seriously .: 24.35
<S> this man , your highness , when he saw me stop before his shop , where he has a display of things which would make your mouth water , my lord , asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the donjon .: 49.80
<S> no , no , said fernand , restraining him , stay !: 27.06
<S> however ill our two friends were mounted , they were soon far in advance of their servants , and arrived at cre vec ur .: 42.77
<S> you will not be pitiless ! cried mordaunt .: 27.44
<S> i speak as i can ; i restrain myself .: 42.50
<S> wait a moment , said athos , perhaps they do not recognize your majesty s voice , and await the order of their captain . have they not heard that of their colonel ?: 41.31
<S> let us horsewhip the fine gentleman ! said others .: 76.70
<S> bonacieux into the little apartment of which we have given a description .: 41.06
<S> everything goes as if in flowery paths . everything goes too well , porthos .: 86.20
<S> yes , my son ; and he rendered very important services to your father .: 38.72
<S> the musketeers , who had already discovered who mazarin was , followed in profound silence .: 66.75
<S> well , said porthos , what do you want , and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation ? hush ! said athos , speaking in a low voice .: 12.04
<S> formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman ; but now it was a different thing ; he answered her summons as an humble soldier obeys an illustrious general .: 70.66
<S> for pity , for mercy s sake do not deliver me up ! it is too late , they are coming , said euge nie .: 27.68
<S> yes , sir ; at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had opened .: 69.53
<S> as , however , he did not fall , as he did not declare himself conquered , but only broke away toward the ho tel of m. de la tre mouille , in whose service he had a relative , d artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound his adversary had received , and pressing him warmly , without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow , when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court , two of the friends of the guardsman , who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with d artagnan , rushed , sword in hand , from the court , and fell upon the conqueror .: 44.07
<S> it was the fault of that blockhead pastrini , that i did not sooner assist you in your distress .: 53.79
<S> peste ! returned albert , i compliment you on it ; i have its fellow he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket and it cost me 3,000 francs . let us hear the history , said franz , motioning signor pastrini to seat himself .: 60.20
<S> the queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince , who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five o clock in the morning .: 25.74
<S> they are alive , that s all that i can say about them ; from time to time i hear of them indirectly , but in what part of the world they are , devil take me if i know , no , on my honor , i have not a friend in the world but you , rochefort . and the illustrious what s the name of the lad whom i made a sergeant in piedmont s regiment ? planchet ! the illustrious planchet .: 44.55
<S> then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew , as if with regret .: 99.23
<S> now after what you told me this morning of your heart , i may believe well , count , replied morrel gayly , i will not dispute it . but you will not make me your confidant , maximilian ? said the count , in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret .: 31.57
<S> fernand saw this , and when he learned of the old man s death he returned .: 31.16
<S> m. d e pinay became very pale ; he looked round him a second time , several members of the club were whispering , and getting their arms from under their cloaks .: 46.99
<S> i do not wish it , said the eye of her grandfather .: 12.15
<S> in my opinion the people are right ; and cheerfully would i give up five years of my pay which i am never paid , by the way to make the king five years older . really !: 57.92
<S> let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time , said porthos .: 93.56
<S> haul taut . they obeyed .: 273.37
<S> as to that , no , replied athos , laughing .: 11.98
<S> how much in that little bag ? seven thousand livres , in louis of twelve francs . seven thousand livres ! cried porthos .: 58.92
<S> if , on the sixteenth day after your departure , at eight o clock in the evening you are not here , no money even if it be but five minutes past eight . then , monsieur , said planchet , you must buy me a watch . take this , said athos , with his usual careless generosity , giving him his own , and be a good lad .: 28.39
<S> their disappearance at first caused much disquietude ; but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto .: 111.22
<S> having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path , he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him .: 68.27
<S> they sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody .: 35.41
<S> six days ago , i landed at portsmouth . well ? said felton .: 32.16
<S> m. de saint me ran had been unwell for some days ; still , the idea of seeing our dear valentine again inspired him with courage , and notwithstanding his illness he would leave .: 55.18
<S> i do not despise bankruptcies , believe me , but they must be those which enrich , not those which ruin .: 131.42
<S> and why so ?: 20.42
<S> the decanter was nearly full , with the exception of a little , which had been already drunk by m. noirtier .: 29.42
<S> meanwhile , do not be surprised at anything that happens ; prepare yourself for every emergency . charles shook his head .: 80.39
<S> read me something , m. debray , she said .: 31.84
<S> at the sight of his friend , porthos uttered a loud cry of joy ; and mousqueton , rising respectfully , yielded his place to him , and went to give an eye to the two stewpans , of which he appeared to have the particular inspection .: 29.01
<S> a fortnight afterward the duke , going to the tennis court , found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside ; he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future day .: 65.98
<S> gone , said morrel ; gone ! adieu , my friend adieu , my father ! gone , murmured valentine ; adieu , my sweet hayde e adieu , my sister ! who can say whether we shall ever see them again ? said morrel with tearful eyes .: 44.25
<S> if richelieu made the king , by comparison , seem small , he made royalty great .: 166.90
<S> this fashion is coming in .: 72.81
<S> during that time he had many moments of despair .: 34.24
<S> with whom are you going to fight ? with beauchamp . one of your friends ! of course ; it is always with friends that one fights . i suppose you have some cause of quarrel ? i have . 40094m what has he done to you ? there appeared in his journal last night but wait , and read for yourself . and albert handed over the paper to the count , who read as follows : a correspondent at yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance .: 65.22
<S> my prisoner ! he cried .: 13.70
<S> unfortunately , no .: 33.24
<S> listen , my dear girl , said d artagnan ; you can not but perceive that all this must end , some way or other .: 31.06
<S> his eyes were fixed upon those of the queen , and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips ; the queen did not wear her diamond studs .: 22.23
<S> he resembles his mother . so he opened the door and beckoned the young man in .: 37.83
<S> has he not come ? said kitty .: 19.24
<S> it is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge .: 32.56
<S> the vision had fled ; and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb , they had vanished at his waking .: 45.92
<S> yes , go , go ! said she to her brother ; the effects are drawing near , on the contrary ; but you , weak fool , will not see them until it is too late to shun them . silence was re established .: 49.98
<S> a very great nobleman , but whether maltese or sicilian i can not exactly say ; but this i know , that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine . it seems to me , said franz , speaking in an undertone to albert , that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord , he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel , and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way .: 63.52
<S> as she went downstairs she gave the keys of valentine s room to m. de villefort , so that no one could reach the sick room excepting through that of madame de villefort and little edward .: 42.68
<S> the queen entered the great hall ; and it was remarked that , like the king , she looked dull and even weary .: 40.11
<S> is this carriage for me ? said dante s .: 18.07
<S> there is but little reason why i should delay you .: 36.96
<S> bertuccio appeared .: 73.39
<S> nature , according to her way , had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself .: 71.57
<S> morrel had looked carelessly around , and had probably noticed nothing .: 64.89
<S> but this , planchet , is so serious and important that i have not informed my friends that i would entrust this secret to you ; and for a captain s commission i would not write it . be satisfied , monsieur , said planchet , you shall see if confidence can be placed in me . mounted on an excellent horse , which he was to leave at the end of twenty leagues in order to take the post , planchet set off at a gallop , his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the musketeers , but otherwise as light hearted as possible .: 52.68
<S> milady is fair , you say ? she has the most beautiful light hair imaginable ! ah , my poor d artagnan ! said athos .: 44.49
<S> i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know , and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity .: 29.80
<S> the road led straight up to the chateau which , compared to its ancestor on the hill , was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the duc d enghein would have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of charles vii .: 72.30
<S> now , then , to breakfast , said beauchamp ; for , if i remember , you told me you only expected two persons , albert . morrel , muttered albert morrel who is he ? but before he had finished , m. de cha teau renaud , a handsome young man of thirty , gentleman all over , that is , with the figure of a guiche and the wit of a mortemart , took albert s hand .: 52.69
<S> m. de villefort , who examined him attentively , and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use , in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes , notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze .: 50.73
<S> then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind , and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene , mene , tekel upharsin of belshazzar .: 64.54
<S> do you know monsieur d artagnan ? lieutenant in the king s musketeers ? said the voice ; you are monsieur d artagnan ? i am . then you came here to defend him ? him ?: 23.11
<S> he found her in a charming humor .: 18.20
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> i have not forgotten all i owe thee .: 33.62
<S> in short , continued the cardinal , as i have heard nothing of you for some time past , i wished to know what you were doing .: 18.96
<S> each fish was brought over in a cask one filled with river herbs and weeds , the other with rushes and lake plants ; they were placed in a wagon built on purpose , and thus the sterlet lived twelve days , the lamprey eight , and both were alive when my cook seized them , killing one with milk and the other with wine .: 137.67
<S> let us say no more on the subject ; you tell me so , i believe you .: 24.59
<S> it must have been the devil who taught it you , was it not ? mordaunt replied by trying his opponent s weapon with an amount of strength which the gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble ; but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which mordaunt had just achieved , he succeeded in meeting his sword , which slid along his own without touching his chest .: 74.35
<S> man s whole life passes in doing these things , and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them .: 107.38
<S> but how can i pay them ? oh , nothing easier ; you have an account open with messrs. thomson french , via dei banchi , rome ; give me a draft for 4,998 louis on these gentlemen , and our banker shall take it . danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace , so he took the pen , ink , and paper peppino offered him , wrote the draft , and signed it .: 69.22
<S> this voice was that of my father .: 17.91
<S> milady fell down , and seemed to be in a swoon .: 22.79
<S> you accuse him , then ?: 22.39
<S> you wish to ask for liberty , and i give it you . oh , my lord ! answered d artagnan , you are too good ; as to our liberty , we have that ; we want to ask something else of you . you have your liberty ? repeated mazarin , in terror .: 28.99
<S> for an apprentice musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love .: 71.61
<S> undeceive yourself , comrade , you are not monsieur de tre ville . my faith ! replied d artagnan , recognizing athos , who , after the dressing performed by the doctor , was returning to his own apartment .: 30.86
<S> and who are you , that they should have made so deep an impression on you ? on them depended my father s life , replied she .: 41.72
<S> we depart from one place , and arrive at another , that is all .: 33.92
<S> meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat , waistcoat , and shirt , and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail , of which the last in france , where daggers are no longer dreaded , was worn by king louis xvi. , who feared the dagger at his breast , and whose head was cleft with a hatchet .: 69.98
<S> in a few days you will be away from this place ; your life , madame , will then no longer be under my care , and , added he , with a sigh , then you can do what you will with it . so , cried milady , as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation , you , a pious man , you who are called a just man , you ask but one thing and that is that you may not be inculpated , annoyed , by my death ! it is my duty to watch over your life , madame , and i will watch . but do you understand the mission you are fulfilling ?: 40.48
<S> i found myself again in complete darkness .: 44.02
<S> i !: 24.10
<S> i have already had the honor of telling you i was , said morrel .: 16.05
<S> then the cardinal put out the waxlight , slipped it into his pocket , and taking up the lantern : now , he said , for monsieur de la fere . very good , thought d artagnan , tis our road likewise ; we will go together . all three set off on their walk , mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones .: 49.38
<S> god is always the last resource .: 50.88
<S> so far , well , said athos , i perceive you know me . the comte de la fe re ! murmured milady , becoming exceedingly pale , and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther .: 38.62
<S> what could that mean ?: 23.42
<S> it was the governor , who , hearing of faria s illness from the jailer , had come in person to see him .: 30.27
<S> sometimes , when monsieur de chavigny paid him a visit , the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of parisians , all fully armed , appear at vincennes to deliver him from prison .: 60.40
<S> the young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment , and to be branded .: 29.34
<S> then m. de tre ville made a sign with his hand , and all retired except d artagnan , who did not forget that he had an audience , and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place .: 20.23
<S> i wish , in order to honor our worthy aldermen , you should appear in ceremonial costume , and above all , ornamented with the diamond studs which i gave you on your birthday .: 69.01
<S> well , said the banker to his daughter , are we then all to be excluded ? he then led the young man into the study , and either by chance or man uvre the door was partially closed after andrea , so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything ; but as the banker had accompanied andrea , madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it .: 49.63
<S> will these be in your way ? he said to the executioner , raising his long locks ; if so , they can be tied up . charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman .: 67.27
<S> the cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent , and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to escape .: 78.33
<S> he mentioned this to gaetano , who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat , bread , wine , half a dozen partridges , and a good fire to roast them by .: 69.94
<S> morbleu ! i won t be their dupe , i will answer for it .: 23.54
<S> cocles appeared , and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to m. morrel s apartment .: 33.38
<S> shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor , and the young lieutenant , with whom we are already acquainted , stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron .: 37.21
<S> against whom do they cry out ?: 94.27
<S> i once endeavored to go down with two of my servants ; but he flew into terrible rage .: 60.23
<S> but i do not mean , my friend that we were right in what we did .: 27.04
<S> she belonged body and soul to her handsome soldier .: 118.32
<S> if he stays in we will break in the window .: 82.03
<S> milady looked at this man , and hesitated .: 21.46
<S> now , to follow out this reasoning , what is the marvellous ? that which we do not understand .: 40.72
<S> one throw is soon made ! and if i lose ? you will win . but if i lose ? well , you will surrender the harnesses . have with you for one throw ! said d artagnan .: 62.79
<S> porthos had six occasions , and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them ; aramis had eight of them .: 55.33
<S> the devil ! replied the prince ; surely , at the death of mazarin .: 25.52
<S> pray do not call what i consider the wisest action of my life by such a name .: 52.10
<S> what is his bearing ? mordaunt hesitated ; but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth .: 32.33
<S> we have already wasted too much . the king again shook hands with all three , exchanged hats with winter and went out .: 53.36
<S> nothing then was altered in the plan , and orders were given to get under weigh next night , and , wind and weather permitting , to make the neutral island by the following day .: 125.20
<S> at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path , about eighteen inches wide ; when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge , upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers .: 55.28
<S> danglars bent his head , which he meant to imply , very well . the carriage again moved on .: 44.67
<S> the man of meung ! replied d artagnan , and disappeared .: 14.83
<S> nevertheless , he never borrowed a sou of his companions , although his purse was ever at their service ; and when he had played upon honor , he always awakened his creditor by six o clock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening .: 43.97
<S> yes , said he , yes , anne of austria is my true queen .: 19.69
<S> then i shall also remain . then , rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man s head , he slowly added , by the blood of christ i swear never to leave you while you live . faria gazed fondly on his noble minded , single hearted , high principled young friend , and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose .: 71.54
<S> and when i told you i had foreseen the result , it is the honor of your visit i alluded to . so much the better .: 27.13
<S> oh , i have been base , cowardly , i tell you ; i have abjured my affections , and like all renegades i am of evil omen to those who surround me ! no , merce de s , said monte cristo , no ; you judge yourself with too much severity .: 39.46
<S> let me see : with regard to porthos , i received a letter from him , too .: 45.99
<S> say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him . now , then , go , said the marquis .: 21.01
<S> it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham , their courage would fail with their hope .: 79.87
<S> bravo !: 16.42
<S> porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a princess .: 52.31
<S> d artagnan , i am your prisoner treat me as such . ah !: 35.47
<S> it was there he must dig .: 47.04
<S> rather say that you have a new love . not so ; i speak frankly to you .: 52.77
<S> indemnity you agree to indemnify and hold the foundation , the trademark owner , any agent or employee of the foundation , anyone providing copies of project gutenberg electronic works in accordance with this agreement , and any volunteers associated with the production , promotion and distribution of project gutenberg electronic works , harmless from all liability , costs and expenses , including legal fees , that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur : a distribution of this or any project gutenberg work , b alteration , modification , or additions or deletions to any project gutenberg work , and c any defect you cause .: 24.40
<S> ah , maternal love is a great virtue , a powerful motive so powerful that it excuses a multitude of things , even if , after duncan s death , lady macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience . madame de villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes , delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to him .: 86.89
<S> i regret not having heard them .: 35.12
<S> of the two persons who composed this group , one was a man and the other a woman .: 34.47
<S> have you informed him of it ? i wrote to him from boulogne .: 28.24
<S> we are so good and gentle to your eminence .: 36.57
<S> now , understand me , said the count , no direct questions , my dear morcerf ; if you wish to know anything , tell me , and i will ask her . agreed . ali reappeared for the third time , and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door , to signify to his master and albert that they were at liberty to pass on .: 32.52
<S> in the king s name ! cried comminges .: 17.06
<S> but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger . that is well understood . and in that case , how shall i know where you are ? you do not want your lackey ? is he a sure man ? to the proof . give him to me .: 39.79
<S> meanwhile , lord de winter , the deputies , the leaders of the expedition , the officers of buckingham s household , had all made their way into the chamber .: 28.87
<S> well , suppose it is a bull fight you are going to see ?: 38.54
<S> he has been fortifying you , his beloved child , against the fatal effects of the poison , which has failed because your system was already impregnated with it .: 78.20
<S> i lost madame du vallon two years ago , he said , and you find me still in affliction on that account .: 39.61
<S> monsieur aramis , become a poet , i beg of you . bazin , my friend , said aramis , i believe you meddle with my conversation . bazin perceived he was wrong ; he bowed and went out .: 24.06
<S> which means that i have just been duped sixty louis for a horse which by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour . d artagnan and athos laughed aloud .: 67.75
<S> certainly , though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement , she was better ; and moreover , monte cristo had told him when , half distracted , he had rushed to the count s house , that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved .: 53.12
<S> well , i was not hot headed then well , but what else could you play for ?: 80.64
<S> no , his horse ; of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite .: 105.81
<S> only think , then , if mademoiselle danglars , instead of being called claire marie euge nie , had been named mademoiselle chastity modesty innocence danglars ; what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage ! hush , said the count , do not joke in so loud a tone ; hayde e may hear you , perhaps . and you think she would be angry ? no , certainly not , said the count with a haughty expression .: 55.83
<S> this count of monte cristo is a strange man , said emmanuel .: 14.58
<S> what then ? how much do you require for my ransom ? merely the 5,000,000 you have about you . danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart .: 58.25
<S> morrel shuddered ; he thought he heard a sob .: 28.54
<S> six hours after he left pierrefonds he was at saint germain .: 53.56
<S> is the countess up yet ? if you wish , i will inquire . yes , ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets , mine is incomplete ; and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three o clock , and that i request permission to introduce someone to her . the valet left the room .: 43.82
<S> his bright eyes kindled , and his mouth , so finely formed , assumed a wicked smile ; every blow he aimed was sure , and his pistol finished the deed annihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise again .: 60.08
<S> so ! thought the gascon here s a young blade who has already his love affair , who doesn t at all agree with athos in his hatred to the fair sex .: 136.29
<S> arrived at the staircase , it was still worse .: 35.00
<S> the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself , nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips .: 138.39
<S> then , by the gleam of a lamp , similar to that which lighted the columbarium , albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him , lying in a corner in profound slumber .: 36.72
<S> he had , not the less , decided upon setting out that same evening ; and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him , he persisted in having the review , hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him .: 60.37
<S> scarcely , however , had they gone a quarter of a league when , having killed a kid , he begged jacopo to take it to his comrades , and request them to cook it , and when ready to let him know by firing a gun .: 44.65
<S> before she went to bed she had pondered , analyzed , turned on all sides , examined on all points , the words , the steps , the gestures , the signs , and even the silence of her interlocutors ; and of this profound , skillful , and anxious study the result was that felton , everything considered , appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors .: 96.38
<S> he turned it gently on its hinges .: 28.34
<S> this crisis past , i endeavored to catch your eye , but could not .: 84.07
<S> then he entreated peppino , as he would a guardian angel , to give him food ; he offered him 1,000 francs for a mouthful of bread .: 54.76
<S> i understand , replied porthos ; she has ordered relays of horses . exactly so . and we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left ? my dear porthos , you are really a man of most superior understanding , said d artagnan , with a look as if he spoke against his conviction .: 33.60
<S> i do ! replied athos , with a deep sigh .: 15.13
<S> it was the cannon which announced the closing of the port .: 29.56
<S> one day , when benedetto was about five or six , our neighbor wasilio , who , according to the custom of the country , never locked up his purse or his valuables for , as your excellency knows , there are no thieves in corsica complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse ; we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money , but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement .: 55.97
<S> out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office , but two remained .: 123.10
<S> her mouth , which might have been found fault with as too large , displayed teeth of pearly whiteness , rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips , contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion .: 104.40
<S> bonacieux to join her .: 28.99
<S> never have i seen you look so young , so beautiful ! the duchess shook her head .: 38.10
<S> in the surrounding plain , which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground , were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat , the effect , no doubt , of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable .: 77.61
<S> is he alive and at liberty ?: 68.24
<S> instead of that , louise do you understand ? air , liberty , melody of birds , plains of lombardy , venetian canals , roman palaces , the bay of naples .: 92.15
<S> you refuse ? cried the cardinal , with astonishment .: 18.95
<S> they wandered about the streets , looking at the pavement as if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them .: 35.14
<S> that will do ; i will be there . endeavor not to make me wait ; for at quarter past twelve i will cut off your ears as you run . good ! cried d artagnan , i will be there ten minutes before twelve . and he set off running as if the devil possessed him , hoping that he might yet find the stranger , whose slow pace could not have carried him far .: 49.28
<S> what can cardinal mazarin be to us , to four men who compelled such a man as richelieu to act as we pleased ?: 101.36
<S> those devilish scotchmen are always thirsty .: 209.10
<S> thank god , i have never heard his name mentioned by any person , and i hope and believe he is dead . do not think so , bertuccio , replied the count ; for the wicked are not so easily disposed of , for god seems to have them under his special watch care to make of them instruments of his vengeance . so be it , responded bertuccio , all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again .: 46.74
<S> certainly not !: 74.57
<S> make no noise , sir , unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards , who take their weakness for a shield .: 44.65
<S> as we have said , the inspector , from discretion , and that he might not disturb the abbe faria s pupil in his researches , had seated himself in a corner , and was reading le drapeau blanc .: 45.64
<S> those lips were magnificent ; they might be said to be of coral .: 75.07
<S> but to avoid risk , put the pistols in the holsters .: 57.11
<S> if he turned up an ace first he won ; if a king he lost .: 178.82
<S> while retracing the past , i forget the present ; and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner . but the ink , said dante s ; of what did you make your ink ? there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon , replied faria , but it was closed up long ere i became an occupant of this prison .: 97.28
<S> to him who is called the comte de la fere . it is i , said athos , and what is the name of the person ? grimaud . ah ! exclaimed athos , turning pale .: 12.42
<S> be it understood we are speaking of athos .: 40.76
<S> it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled .: 60.13
<S> pay no attention to it ; you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy . then i have full occupation , for i am so . not yet ; wait a little !: 74.11
<S> suppose i happen to strangle him ? to be sure there would only be a swiss the less in the world ; but you will not do so , i hope .: 30.91
<S> m. de tre ville listened to the young man s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair .: 37.31
<S> then he passed his hand across his forehead , which was clouded with doubt .: 22.96
<S> be one or the other , but not both , replied porthos .: 32.07
<S> on the contrary , let us speak about it ; for it was agreed among us , once for all , that we should always hold together , though engaged on opposing sides . yes , added athos , i now ask you , d artagnan , what side you are on ?: 45.83
<S> for to me there is but one ; the other was an instrument , that was all . what , brother ! cried milady , must i name him again ?: 55.62
<S> well , i should hope , in the first instance , to have for keeper an honest fellow like you . and you have me , my lord .: 49.05
<S> will your majesty pardon me , said planchet , but is it really the king who is lying there ? anne of austria started .: 34.32
<S> well ? exclaimed franz and the sailors in unison .: 39.09
<S> returning to her own room , kitty had thrown the purse into a corner , where it lay open , disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet .: 45.75
<S> now , since , as every one knows , asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection , this civility infuriated monsieur de beaufort .: 108.43
<S> no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her , while on his side the count thought she was about to address him ; but both remained silent , and after a mere bow , monte cristo directed his steps to albert , who received him cordially .: 37.93
<S> but a recompense was in store for him ; turning around , he saw near the door a beautiful fair face , whose large blue eyes were , without any marked expression , fixed upon him , while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips .: 59.08
<S> in a quarter of an hour he returned , accompanied by a tall man , masked , and wrapped in a large red cloak .: 16.35
<S> i possess a share of wit , and a certain relative sensibility , which enables me to draw from life in general , for the support of mine , all i meet with that is good , like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents .: 69.06
<S> there is to be war in flanders .: 48.93
<S> these were all who were left of the little troop .: 33.83
<S> mademoiselle danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men , and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor .: 36.10
<S> the three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop .: 25.69
<S> i insult you ! said lord de winter , with contempt .: 17.39
<S> almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened , the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to milady , who leaned upon it , and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness .: 22.71
<S> they laugh best who laugh last ! having delivered himself of this pompous address , uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath , he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing room , whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chausse e d antin .: 84.07
<S> do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg license terms from this work , or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg .: 17.42
<S> it seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot . wait , said caderousse , we shall see . he then took the greatcoat with the large collar , which the groom had left behind in the tilbury , and put it on his back ; then he took off cavalcanti s hat , which he placed upon his own head , and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself .: 41.80
<S> he pushed on toward him , but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley , into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it .: 65.13
<S> m. de monte cristo yields his right of using his . we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count , said beauchamp , and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten days since , thinking to want them on a similar occasion .: 65.61
<S> if not , i will apply to the chancellor , i will apply to the king , i will apply to the hangman , i will move the courts against you , i will denounce you as branded , i will bring you to trial ; and if you are acquitted , well , by the faith of a gentleman , i will kill you at the corner of some wall , as i would a mad dog . i like the means well enough , said d artagnan , but where and how to meet with her ? time , dear friend , time brings round opportunity ; opportunity is the martingale of man .: 49.42
<S> but let us see ; whatever i may be , she added , hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow , let us see what profession you wish to follow . athos , standing , looked at them both with indescribable pleasure .: 62.79
<S> however , scarcely was the imperial power established that is , scarcely had the emperor re entered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readers , he found on the table there louis xviii . s half filled snuff box , scarcely had this occurred when marseilles began , in spite of the authorities , to rekindle the flames of civil war , always smouldering in the south , and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad .: 131.56
<S> i have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of , and here i am . mme .: 34.32
<S> he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police , notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend , or perhaps because of that advice , when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy , whom he alone should recognize and over whom , if such were the case , he alone would gain any advantage , as fiesco17 had done over the moor who would have killed him .: 60.05
<S> nothing will ever go well with us hereafter ! oh , heaven !: 78.10
<S> athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired .: 39.21
<S> there , said monte cristo placing his arms around the count , and leaning with him over the front of the box , just as hayde e , whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian , perceived his pale features close to morcerf s face .: 37.04
<S> my arm and my life belong to you , like my love . then , said milady , since you are as generous as you are loving she stopped .: 44.05
<S> this house was gloomy because it was remorseful : it was remorseful because it concealed a crime . who said it was a crime ? asked villefort , with a last effort .: 54.40
<S> is it as good now ? oh , yes , replied andrea , laughing .: 14.70
<S> still , they may have concealed some precious stone , some valuable diamond ; so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures .: 64.25
<S> a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions .: 174.15
<S> my first business will be to dispose of this diamond . so saying , the abbe again drew the small box from his pocket , opened it , and contrived to hold it in such a light , that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of caderousse .: 38.34
<S> adieu , valentine , adieu ! said morrel , bowing .: 15.54
<S> just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit , they saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock , and they fired the signal agreed upon .: 58.07
<S> this tranquillity proved one thing that d artagnan did not yet know milady .: 42.46
<S> the appointed hour was about to strike .: 43.58
<S> she then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises , in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their lives .: 151.22
<S> with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord , and faria had been equally silent .: 111.57
<S> had i been alone i should scarcely have gone to rueil without great caution .: 60.94
<S> as to the servant , he had , as we have said , been with his master for five and twenty years , therefore he knew all his habits , and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything , so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid .: 43.14
<S> edward ! he stammered edward ! the child did not answer .: 50.65
<S> d artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeer s uniform in every street of the camp .: 51.24
<S> oh , said valentine , we have been waiting for you with such impatience , dear m. d avrigny .: 18.45
<S> she has met mademoiselle de villefort , and has taken her arm ; see , they are following us , both in white dresses , one with a bouquet of camellias , the other with one of myosotis .: 44.99
<S> d artagnan glanced at the dinner service .: 29.79
<S> it is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies , who will give him evil counsel ; whereas , brought up by the coadjutor , for instance , he would imbibe national principles and love his people . that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks , the patrols of armed shop people , and the bands of mendicants reappeared .: 89.82
<S> moderato ! he cried as they descended .: 55.96
<S> messrs .: 211.00
<S> after supper i exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening ; but this time , as i yielded to fatigue , or as if i had become familiarized with danger , i dragged myself toward my bed , let my robe fall , and lay down .: 54.81
<S> yes ; my son , and a sacred command . say it , my father . the house of thomson french is the only one who , from humanity , or , it may be , selfishness it is not for me to read men s hearts has had any pity for me .: 52.79
<S> how do you feel this morning ? he inquired .: 22.48
<S> he threw some dust over the topcoat , which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume , and going to chapelle en serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place .: 94.66
<S> you may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion .: 81.31
<S> do not my mother and you agree ? asked albert , astonished .: 25.36
<S> france is large ; the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant . and who is to pursue him ? cried mazarin .: 50.31
<S> and yet they were the same , murmured monte cristo , only now it is broad daylight instead of night ; it is the sun which brightens the place , and makes it appear so cheerful . he proceeded towards the quay by the rue saint laurent , and advanced to the consigne ; it was the point where he had embarked .: 40.46
<S> the order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening .: 26.46
<S> well , cried milady , in a sharp voice .: 12.95
<S> but the count , disregarding his cry , continued to wring the bandit s wrist , until , his arm being dislocated , he fell first on his knees , then flat on the floor .: 47.10
<S> that is not all ; the money gained in the exercise of my profession i have distributed to the poor ; i have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me .: 79.60
<S> marseilles is filled with half pay officers , who are daily , under one frivolous pretext or other , getting up quarrels with the royalists ; from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons , and assassinations in the lower . you have heard , perhaps , said the comte de salvieux , one of m. de saint me ran s oldest friends , and chamberlain to the comte d artois , that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence ? yes ; they were talking about it when we left paris , said m. de saint me ran ; and where is it decided to transfer him ? to saint helena . for heaven s sake , where is that ? asked the marquise .: 62.55
<S> his heart ceased beating , he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table .: 31.31
<S> the messenger resisted ; my brother killed him . oh ! said mme .: 39.55
<S> really , porthos , you are a gifted individual ! i have heard speak , said porthos , of a certain milo of crotona , who performed wonderful feats , such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting it of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders , et cetera .: 92.91
<S> so many times , in order to follow valentine in thought at every hour in the day , had he made her describe the whole house , that without having seen it he knew it all .: 51.49
<S> sir , said comminges , i am the bearer of an order from the king . very well , sir , replied broussel , what is this order ? and he held out his hand .: 13.85
<S> i tell you , one of them was saying , that if coysel predicted that , tis as good as true ; i know nothing about it , but i have heard say that he s not only an astrologer , but a magician . deuce take it , friend , if he s one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying so . why ? because he may be tried for it . ah !: 53.11
<S> your profession ? first i was a forger , answered andrea , as calmly as possible ; then i became a thief , and lately have become an assassin . a murmur , or rather storm , of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly .: 61.07
<S> i have just made m. de villefort promise to call on him , and i hope the visit will be returned .: 29.27
<S> this time there could be no doubt ; d artagnan was really insulted .: 24.30
<S> he opened a window and leaned out to listen .: 20.95
<S> my officer , said athos , has forgotten to give a piece of very important information to the lady , and has sent me back to repair his forgetfulness . go up , said the host ; she is still in her chamber . athos availed himself of the permission , ascended the stairs with his lightest step , gained the landing , and through the open door perceived milady putting on her hat .: 44.96
<S> it is quite immaterial to me , said monte cristo , and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle .: 24.57
<S> but , devil take him !: 35.29
<S> he reached it before the carriage arrived .: 44.45
<S> a second after , he saw it again , approaching with frightful rapidity .: 44.40
<S> the pupils of his eyes , as he gazed at monte cristo dilated horribly .: 77.31
<S> your swords are in the corner ; do not forget them , they are in many circumstances very useful ; there is porthos s purse , too . he put it into his pocket .: 42.90
<S> i have now been six years with m. noirtier , and let him tell you if ever once , during that time , he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand . no , signed the old man .: 36.65
<S> information about the mission of project gutenberg project gutenberg is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete , old , middle aged and new computers .: 52.41
<S> i know it well , so take grimaud . take mousqueton . take bazin . take planchet .: 92.62
<S> caderousse was equally restless and uneasy , but instead of seeking , like m. morrel , to aid dante s , he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy , in the hope of drowning reflection .: 51.15
<S> if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement , you must obtain permission in writing from the project gutenberg literary archive foundation , the manager of the project gutenberg trademark .: 9.21
<S> go to blin or ve ronique for your clothes .: 207.08
<S> well , then , resumed faria with a bitter smile , let me answer your question in full , by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the cha teau d if , for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity ; and , in all probability , i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children , if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair . dante s remained for a short time mute and motionless ; at length he said : then you abandon all hope of escape ? i perceive its utter impossibility ; and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve . nay , be not discouraged .: 58.44
<S> te deum for the victory of lens .: 107.76
<S> as soon as she was seated in the vehicle , she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil , which she tied on to her straw bonnet .: 30.12
<S> well ; buckingham heard by some means , no doubt , of my return .: 67.90
<S> bonacieux , and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her , d artagnan would have returned home , since he had so promised .: 40.09
<S> we are about to leave this evening , continued mazarin .: 15.10
<S> now , said the count , what will you take a glass of sherry , port , or alicante ? alicante , if you please ; it is my favorite wine . i have some that is very good .: 22.24
<S> let me think a moment .: 25.72
<S> yes , the gascon answered ; athos !: 40.35
<S> i can only tell you that madame de villefort sent to request my presence , as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended .: 37.19
<S> valentine chapter 103 .: 58.45
<S> if you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me , the young girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit may obtain his pardon .: 44.50
<S> and thus they parted the best possible friends , and m. de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers . the countess made no reply .: 55.16
<S> this is quite another man , and does not resemble him at all .: 33.17
<S> the cha teau d if ? cried he , what are we going there for ? the gendarme smiled .: 25.43
<S> the presentation when albert found himself alone with monte cristo , my dear count , said he , allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you a specimen of a bachelor s apartment .: 65.67
<S> the people who wrote are anglo germans , you know . oh , as for the composition of the letter , there is nothing to be said ; but as regards the competency of the document , i certainly have doubts . is it possible ? asked the count , assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor .: 42.87
<S> besides , be assured , my dear edmond , the dungeon i am about to leave will not long remain empty ; some other unfortunate being will soon take my place , and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation .: 57.55
<S> here ! cried porthos , here ! porthos foresaw that if d artagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the bed .: 46.74
<S> besides , she felt as we feel when a storm is coming on that this issue was near , and could not fail to be terrible .: 56.39
<S> do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence ? not the slightest , but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences . but who perpetrated that joke , let me ask ?: 83.56
<S> what is the matter , my dear m. mouston ? asked d artagnan .: 6.99
<S> then his two guides took his arms , and he went on , guided by them , and preceded by the sentinel .: 24.69
<S> at last , as albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time , at the beginning of the second act the door opened , and monte cristo entered , dressed in black , and , leaning over the front of the box , looked around the pit .: 22.04
<S> at this moment a horse neighed .: 25.28
<S> order was re established in the hall , except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another .: 101.44
<S> i would almost answer for planchet . well , my dear friend , add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money , and then , instead of answering for him once , answer for him twice . why , good god !: 37.70
<S> to answer you would be to forget it .: 50.69
<S> d artagnan thought this could not last long , and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears .: 30.93
<S> count , to possess valentine would have been a happiness too infinite , too ecstatic , too complete , too divine for this world , since it has been denied me ; but without valentine the earth is desolate . i have told you to hope , said the count .: 58.95
<S> when franz appeared again on the shore , the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon .: 54.54
<S> dante s glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth ; then paused with hand in mid air .: 67.96
<S> this was the name which he gave him in former days , in their moments of tender intimacy .: 48.53
<S> he sent immediately for a cabriolet , and hastened to the publisher s office .: 36.76
<S> mousqueton s horse which had traveled for five or six hours without a rider the day before , might have been able to pursue the journey ; but by an inconceivable error the veterinary surgeon , who had been sent for , as it appeared , to bleed one of the host s horses , had bled mousqueton s .: 52.23
<S> certainly i see him . then i did not kill him ? really , i think you are going mad , good bertuccio , said the count .: 23.59
<S> i believed you dead ; why did i survive you ?: 72.23
<S> there is a proposition almost like it in the augustinus of the heresiarch jansenius , whose book will sooner or later be burned by the hands of the executioner .: 65.75
<S> no , be assured , i am not mad .: 12.00
<S> gentlemen , continued he , addressing the guardsmen , i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure .: 23.21
<S> from seven o clock in the morning a crowd was stationed at the iron gates , and an hour before the trial commenced the hall was full of the privileged .: 31.24
<S> but what do you think of the music ? what music ? why , the music you have been listening to . oh , it is well enough as the production of a human composer , sung by featherless bipeds , to quote the late diogenes . from which it would seem , my dear count , that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise ? 30097m you are right , in some degree ; when i wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to , i go to sleep . then sleep here , my dear count .: 69.29
<S> there , what do you think now of the affair ?: 22.09
<S> and this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court , a victory at home and abroad ; so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed , ah , gentlemen of the parliament , we shall see what you will say now ! upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart , whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own .: 77.52
<S> there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement .: 21.06
<S> hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them , and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them .: 49.51
<S> only that our enemies have escaped ; they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat . mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door .: 56.57
<S> now , said d artagnan , i am going to call this soldier and talk to him .: 13.94
<S> that is not an answer , replied athos .: 14.40
<S> but there must be some cause for this strange scene . the count of morcerf s adventure exasperates the young man . have you anything to do with it ? it was through hayde e that the chamber was informed of his father s treason . indeed ? said morrel .: 34.56
<S> ah yes ! mazarin bit his lips as he spoke ; i know your devotion to her majesty . i have been a captain in the queen s guards for twenty years , was the reply .: 33.08
<S> what is it ? asked he .: 5.11
<S> nature subdued must yield in the combat , the dream must succeed to reality , and then the dream reigns supreme , then the dream becomes life , and life becomes the dream .: 148.29
<S> i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair .: 52.79
<S> and she began to shriek more loudly , clinging to the bars of the window : help !: 51.48
<S> the house ali had chosen , and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo , was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champs e lyse es .: 33.76
<S> what man ? a mendicant . give him alms , bazin , and bid him pray for a poor sinner . this mendicant insists upon speaking to you , and pretends that you will be very glad to see him . has he sent no particular message for me ? yes .: 59.31
<S> as we have said , he was lying on the deck .: 12.02
<S> i see nothing but faces a yard broad ; in short , it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb , and that the trees , instead of leaves and flowers , are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days . as for me , said planchet , i seem to smell , from this place , even , a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat , and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge , hailing our approach .: 94.81
<S> maximilian , said he , are your affections disengaged ? morrel looked at monte cristo with astonishment .: 23.36
<S> father and son m. noirtier for it was , indeed , he who entered looked after the servant until the door was closed , and then , fearing , no doubt , that he might be overheard in the antechamber , he opened the door again , nor was the precaution useless , as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain , who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents .: 73.61
<S> do you think they have recognized us ? said d artagnan .: 11.17
<S> and lord de winter do you know anything about him ? i know that he is in high favor with charles i. the fortunes of that monarch now are at low water .: 59.35
<S> but would you believe that i purchase all this delight , joy , and happiness , for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life , at the small cost of 500 francs per annum , paid quarterly ?: 64.00
<S> for heaven s sake don t be obstinate , for when others are obstinate i am obstinate likewise , and then i become ferocious and headstrong , and there s my friend , who is even more headstrong and ferocious than myself .: 80.62
<S> let me kill him . we are all four lost , if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him . then turning to the young man he exclaimed : a fine prize !: 47.48
<S> the young man was more pale than usual , and his eyes , reddened by want of sleep , denoted that he had passed a feverish night .: 23.68
<S> captain gaumard , recovered from his illness , had returned from palma .: 96.84
<S> what s the matter ?: 10.56
<S> i am as poor as job , and were you to search my pockets and my boxes i don t believe you would find a hundred pistoles . peste !: 37.13
<S> they resumed their route .: 19.68
<S> she ran to the window and opened it .: 11.33
<S> i ?: 34.71
<S> this would have been a method of reckoning time , had not dante s long ceased to do so .: 35.63
<S> then there was the ring with the lion s head , which c sar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand .: 43.48
<S> that is another thing , said porthos .: 8.29
<S> but when napoleon returned to paris , danglars heart failed him , and he lived in constant fear of dante s return on a mission of vengeance .: 55.43
<S> listen , he said ; today is the 5th of september , is it not ? yes . today , then , at eleven o clock , your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay ? yes , we know that . well , then , continued emmanuel , we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house . what will happen then ? why , if today before eleven o clock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid , he will be compelled at twelve o clock to declare himself a bankrupt . oh , come , then , come ! cried she , hastening away with the young man .: 26.07
<S> very brave , said monte cristo ; i have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head . and i know he has fought two duels , said morrel .: 29.14
<S> these three windows were in madame de saint me ran s room .: 13.15
<S> d artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to mme .: 37.61
<S> on the morrow , at three o clock in the afternoon , they arrived at surge res .: 13.00
<S> i fear he may have been an ancestor of your eminence . monsieur d artagnan , you are a great wit and i am really sorry to be on bad terms with you . my lord , let us come to terms ; i ask nothing better . very well , said mazarin , if i place you in security , in a manner evident , palpable ah !: 34.98
<S> the rabbit died .: 44.22
<S> she saw d avrigny curiously examining the glass , which she felt certain of having emptied during the night .: 42.26
<S> monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of morrel , who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen .: 51.80
<S> i understood that i had nothing to fear , that i should neither be seen nor heard , so i decided upon descending to the garden .: 33.39
<S> besides , i have promised him your patronage . you are right , said the duke .: 16.43
<S> but what then must be done ? asked morrel .: 20.62
<S> and with whom ? lord , who can say , monsieur ?: 45.64
<S> fly , fly ! yes , yes , let us fly ! repeated mme .: 30.48
<S> d artagnan unfolded the paper .: 18.30
<S> well , what do you see from this window ?: 15.93
<S> adieu , my charmer ; i will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better humor . at these words he blew a whistle ; the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and disappeared .: 43.36
<S> your excellency , said the captain , that was the land signal , will you answer yourself ? what signal ? the captain pointed towards the island , up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke , increasing as it rose .: 54.85
<S> he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried .: 80.60
<S> were you present during the last struggle ? asked m. d avrigny .: 32.58
<S> you , is it ?: 30.40
<S> oh ? said caderousse , thunderstruck , but for that black hair , i should say you were the englishman , lord wilmore . i am neither the abbe busoni nor lord wilmore , said monte cristo ; think again , do you not recollect me ? there was a magic effect in the count s words , which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man .: 49.92
<S> as athos and aramis proceeded , and passed different companies on the road , they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battle .: 38.23
<S> and the next day , bernajoux .: 26.41
<S> indeed , every day the king asked the cardinal when this fe te should take place ; and every day the cardinal , under some pretext , deferred fixing it .: 64.66
<S> i go , said he ; i go at once . how , you will go ! said mme .: 17.24
<S> you arrive , and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company ; yet i expect , in all probability , to quit the convent at any moment . how , you are going soon ? asked milady .: 56.91
<S> franz returned to the manuscript , and continued : sir , said the president , you have been invited to join this assembly you were not forced here ; it was proposed to you to come blindfolded you accepted .: 54.34
<S> the executioner , who had lifted himself up , fell back upon his bed .: 16.35
<S> grimaud s first intention had been to return to paris , but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion raoul , and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hour s riding would unite them , and that the going , returning and explanation would not occupy an hour , he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of mazingarbe .: 68.71
<S> d artagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris .: 13.38
<S> stop !: 27.26
<S> i do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her .: 37.50
<S> andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the cheval rouge , but after leaning an instant against the door , and hearing the last sound of the cab , which was disappearing from view , he went on his road , and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues .: 57.79
<S> for the rest , he was dumb , blind , and deaf , and of unimpeachable fidelity .: 34.57
<S> yet i had read , i had even written a precise history of the borgia family , for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the cardinal c sar spada ; but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi , his companion in misfortune .: 66.41
<S> at this challenge , vampa rose quickly , drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle .: 48.52
<S> the blow , so they tell me at least , was struck with a master s hand . mordaunt remembered that cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account , and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution , hidden behind some screen or curtain .: 61.20
<S> thanks to m. morrel , all the forms were got over ; in a word i was , as i told you , at my marriage feast ; and i should have been married in an hour , and tomorrow i intended to start for paris , had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust . ah , said villefort , this seems to me the truth .: 31.34
<S> the pharaon is entering the harbor ! morrel fell back in his chair , his strength was failing him ; his understanding weakened by such events , refused to comprehend such incredible , unheard of , fabulous facts .: 107.37
<S> listen , now , to what i say in this my dying moment .: 61.55
<S> does your majesty require anything further ?: 64.06
<S> at last , said he , i shall know with whom i have to do . they opened the door and the four men alighted . franz again interrupted himself , and wiped the cold drops from his brow ; there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his father s death , which had hitherto been a mystery .: 51.31
<S> are we mistaken , and is dante s triumphant in spite of all we have believed ? why , we must inquire into that , was caderousse s reply ; and turning towards the young man , said , well , catalan , can t you make up your mind ? fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow , and slowly entered the arbor , whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses , and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body .: 65.28
<S> monsieur de beaufort was at supper , but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced .: 29.03
<S> his was one of those rare organizations , endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog ; with a blind valor , a quick eye , and a prompt hand ; to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone , and the hand to strike this displeasing personage , whether a besme , a maurevers , a poltiot de me re , or a vitry .: 109.68
<S> ah , danglars ! whispered caderousse , you have deceived me the trick you spoke of last night has been played ; but i can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault .: 49.45
<S> we must now only think of you , my dear friend , and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible .: 60.85
<S> who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him ?: 75.27
<S> for soon , perhaps , i shall not hear , and i shall die without knowing what she has written to me . laporte made no further objection , and read : my lord , by that which , since i have known you , have suffered by you and for you , i conjure you , if you have any care for my repose , to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against france , to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause , and of which , it is generally whispered , your love for me is the concealed cause .: 56.32
<S> this time , said d artagnan , when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot , i think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach france .: 30.37
<S> although he felt himself ably supported , the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase , step by step .: 73.07
<S> m. de morcerf went out about half an hour ago ; the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation . i am ready , my son , said merce de s .: 23.32
<S> so then , sir , said morrel , you hold bills of mine ? yes , and for a considerable sum . what is the amount ? asked morrel with a voice he strove to render firm .: 30.78
<S> the garden was long and narrow ; a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle , and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage , that made a background for the shrubs and flowers .: 74.49
<S> when i look at this room , whence so many guilty creatures have departed , trembling and ashamed , when i look at that chair before which i now sit trembling and ashamed , oh , it requires all my reason to convince me that i am not a very guilty woman and you a menacing judge . villefort dropped his head and sighed .: 69.72
<S> she then thought that lord de winter would come , and by his presence give fresh strength to her jailer .: 46.61
<S> how often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend a friend lost to him forever ; and on his death bed , when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light , this thought , which had until then been but a doubt , became a conviction , and his last words were , maximilian , it was edmond dante s ! at these words the count s paleness , which had for some time been increasing , became alarming ; he could not speak ; he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour , said a few hurried words to madame herbault , and pressing the hands of emmanuel and maximilian , madame , said he , i trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally ; i value your friendship , and feel grateful to you for your welcome , for this is the first time for many years that i have thus yielded to my feelings ; and he hastily quitted the apartment .: 54.82
<S> well , tempter , what more do you want with me ? said d artagnan .: 13.66
<S> he ascended into grottos paved with emeralds , with panels of rubies , and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites .: 123.50
<S> he determined to cultivate the good will of the youth raoul and , either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting , to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the present .: 187.20
<S> the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished .: 158.66
<S> you have often heard me speak of them , have you not , my friend ? yes ; but i confess i always thought you jested . with such things !: 29.94
<S> you are young , replied athos ; and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances . epilogue la rochelle , deprived of the assistance of the english fleet and of the diversion promised by buckingham , surrendered after a siege of a year .: 65.03
<S> aramis , you know , continued athos , is naturally cold , and then he is always involved in intrigues with women . i believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one , said d artagnan .: 32.44
<S> his holiness had an idea .: 40.14
<S> who knows ? said gondy ; such men are like thunderbolts one recognizes them only when they have struck . every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence , during which the queen pressed her hand to her side , evidently to still the beatings of her heart .: 47.73
<S> he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain , but nothing positive had been learned .: 79.07
<S> what was your deputy called ? de villefort ! the abbe burst into a fit of laughter , while dante s gazed on him in utter astonishment .: 30.09
<S> besides , were not those riches chimerical ? offspring of the brain of the poor abbe faria , had they not died with him ?: 69.97
<S> the number of lights had been intentionally diminished , but the young woman could not conceal the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two days .: 33.83
<S> we will divide our regiments into two squadrons .: 73.91
<S> hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain .: 41.37
<S> and where is she , then ?: 17.92
<S> his colleagues looked at him , and doubtless pitied his prospects , blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman .: 56.71
<S> as to aramis , he had asked for leave of absence for five days , and was gone , it was said , to rouen on family business .: 38.70
<S> they are men who do nothing for nothing . you know the only reply that i desire , said d artagnan , the only one worthy of you and of me ! and he drew nearer to her .: 40.38
<S> monsieur de chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province , and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter .: 48.76
<S> well , said andrea , admitting your love , why do you want me to breakfast with you ? that i may have the pleasure of seeing you , my little fellow . what is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements ? eh , dear friend , said caderousse , are wills ever made without codicils ?: 32.92
<S> well , at a few minutes to seven at a few minutes to seven ? cried la ramee , cold sweat upon his brow .: 36.52
<S> answer , or we charge . beware of what you are about , gentlemen ! said a clear voice which seemed accustomed to command .: 58.85
<S> there was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except cardinal mazarin .: 48.66
<S> he has two means of extricating me from this dilemma , the one by a mysterious escape , managed through bribery ; the other by buying off my judges with gold .: 85.38
<S> i can imagine the effect , i do not see the means . i will find the means myself . you are aware it will be war , civil war , furious , devouring , implacable ? oh !: 65.30
<S> my fist is strong enough i swear , cried porthos , extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton .: 60.45
<S> the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal , and one of them , passing under d artagnan s arm , entered and broke a mirror , in which porthos was complacently admiring himself .: 48.86
<S> i thought i had told you a most lamentable story . and he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his heart .: 18.44
<S> general information about project gutenberg electronic works professor michael s. hart was the originator of the project gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone .: 10.30
<S> you say you desire my mother s good opinion ; i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent . 30111m do you think so ? said monte cristo , with interest .: 35.94
<S> the cavalier entered the second hall , which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers .: 30.93
<S> monsieur bazin , the beadle ? said the verger .: 39.47
<S> what do you say ?: 5.61
<S> enervated , prostrate , and breathless , he became unconscious of outward objects ; he seemed to be entering that vague delirium preceding death .: 149.67
<S> have you seen him ? i left him five days ago , said d artagnan , and he portrayed with gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of porthos in his chateau of pierrefonds ; nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent monsieur mouston .: 69.76
<S> one of us would suffice . really , my dear monsieur d artagnan , said the cardinal , your coolness startles me . i should have thought , on the contrary , that it ought to have inspired you with confidence . and bernouin do i not take him with me ? there is no room for him , he will rejoin your eminence . let us go , said mazarin , since everything must be done as you wish . my lord , there is time to draw back , said d artagnan , and your eminence is perfectly free . not at all , not at all , said mazarin ; let us be off . and so they descended the private stair , mazarin leaning on the arm of d artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling .: 28.81
<S> i think so , answered albert in a firm tone .: 18.54
<S> he instantly retired , from a feeling of respectful delicacy ; it was , however , evident that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and the other officers on horseback .: 50.32
<S> was she dead ?: 59.32
<S> he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and houdinie re .: 41.67
<S> the duke came straight up to him , and said : monsieur de tre ville , his majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my ho tel .: 19.88
<S> thank you , madame , i am aware of them now ; monsieur cardinal has enlightened me on that head . the cardinal ? cried mme .: 29.43
<S> in the meanwhile the promises of m. de tre ville went on prosperously .: 18.16
<S> you evidently know her .: 117.70
<S> yes , he said , there is the stone upon which i used to sit ; there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall ; there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall .: 40.87
<S> sensible ! i always obey , madame , when i am commanded by so gentle a voice . he kissed her hand tenderly .: 73.52
<S> these attempts did not prevent the cardinal , to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery , from making nocturnal excursions , sometimes to communicate to the duc d angoule me important orders , sometimes to confer with the king , and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home .: 76.06
<S> they obtained information at ablain , and a statement of their route was left for grimaud .: 87.87
<S> barrois , said valentine , shut the door , and let no one come in . she passed first .: 31.54
<S> the count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly passions .: 67.21
<S> i have seen them before . as ugly ? no , but reasonably hideous . what a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar ! pshaw ! said de guiche .: 50.24
<S> peppino passed , lighted his torch , and turned to see if they came after him .: 29.71
<S> mazarin sent us to cromwell .: 56.17
<S> she took the risk upon herself .: 63.10
<S> your husband , then , is at last dead ? how does that concern you ? replied the swiss .: 28.48
<S> i owe you my real good , my present happiness ; and all the sovereigns of the earth , even c sar borgia himself , could not deprive me of this . thus , if not actually happy , yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly .: 72.17
<S> made richelieu smile .: 321.53
<S> the carriage pursued its way , still going at a great pace , till it dashed into paris , and disappeared .: 72.36
<S> you are mad , dear friend . judge not rashly , say the gospel and the cardinal , replied athos .: 47.95
<S> how delightful to see you again , dear friend ! he cried , in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass , you ve not then forgotten me ? forget you !: 68.63
<S> they waited for ten minutes , during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered , and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned , closed the door after them , and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights , disappeared .: 38.02
<S> redistribution is subject to the trademark license , especially commercial redistribution .: 22.74
<S> la ramee !: 17.09
<S> don t let us disarrange your eminence .: 30.64
<S> he darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world ; but the hackney coach drove on and the head of neither merce de s nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband .: 79.65
<S> confound it ! cried the gascon , trying in vain , too late , to retract the thrust .: 35.67
<S> the jailer always brought dante s soup in an iron saucepan ; this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners , for dante s had noticed that it was either quite full , or half empty , according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first .: 108.63
<S> the abbe busoni did right to send you to me , he went on in his ordinary tone , and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history , as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future .: 54.51
<S> he threw them on the table without looking at them , so sure was he of victory ; d artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill humor .: 46.45
<S> and who am i , to nourish such ambition ?: 62.90
<S> between people like us threats are out of place , everything should be amicably arranged .: 143.19
<S> a moment , said d artagnan .: 8.40
<S> there and elsewhere . the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed , still with the same tranquillity : madame , if the opinion i have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow .: 76.29
<S> then m. de tre ville , unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man , requested m. de la tre mouille to interrogate him himself .: 21.25
<S> see , my father , see ! villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man , who , almost a stranger to him , called noirtier his father .: 37.74
<S> you held her hand you were feeling her pulse and the second fit came on before you had turned towards me .: 107.68
<S> this mysterious shade , spread over his whole person , rendered still more interesting the man whose eyes or mouth , even in the most complete intoxication , had never revealed anything , however skillfully questions had been put to him .: 97.46
<S> breathe not a word of that , or the comte de la fere will be furious . you think the count will be angry with me ? think it ?: 35.09
<S> yes , indeed , the marks are recent . quite so , replied the lieutenant .: 26.76
<S> when we show a friend a city one has already visited , we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been .: 135.90
<S> and i have not seen him !: 18.04
<S> scarcely had the door closed , when m. de villefort sent to tell valentine to be ready in the drawing room in half an hour , as he expected the notary and m. d e pinay and his witnesses .: 25.62
<S> then he added with a certain uneasiness , did you meet them ? why , yes , i think so in the street , said athos ; and he looked smilingly at aramis , who looked at him with an expression of surprise .: 20.95
<S> to your eminence ! murmured bonacieux , rolling his eyes round in astonishment .: 45.28
<S> until then you will not see me .: 43.39
<S> then all his suspicions were confirmed ; the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest .: 54.71
<S> then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of god s justice . he will be found . well , said the cardinal , then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required . your eminence is right , replied milady ; and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is that is , to announce to his grace , on the part of your eminence , that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fe te given by madame the constable ; that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham ; that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens , with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place , and portraits of the actors who figured in them ; that montague is in the bastille , and that the torture may make him say things he remembers , and even things he has forgotten ; that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse , found in his grace s lodging , which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it , but her in whose name it was written .: 63.46
<S> de villefort ! cried the king , is the messenger s name m. de villefort ? yes , sire . and he comes from marseilles ? in person . why did you not mention his name at once ? replied the king , betraying some uneasiness .: 25.43
<S> poor things !: 49.20
<S> tis here , said athos .: 14.63
<S> if that is really so , how came you in the bastille ? how i came there , or rather why i am there , replied bonacieux , that is entirely impossible for me to tell you , because i don t know myself ; but to a certainty it is not for having , knowingly at least , disobliged monsieur the cardinal . you must , nevertheless , have committed a crime , since you are here and are accused of high treason . of high treason ! cried bonacieux , terrified ; of high treason !: 46.45
<S> this unexpected circumstance brought back richelieu s former anxiety , and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the other side of the sea .: 44.59
<S> they questioned him as to his sentiments , but he contented himself with answering , that the letters from the island of elba ought to have informed them franz interrupted himself by saying , my father was a royalist ; they need not have asked his sentiments , which were well known . and hence , said villefort , arose my affection for your father , my dear m. franz .: 56.77
<S> you must be tired , said she to the jeweller ; i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed ; go up when you are ready , and sleep well . joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury , but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that , instead of diminishing , the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased ; resigning himself , therefore , to what seemed inevitable , he bade his host good night , and mounted the stairs .: 68.88
<S> sometimes , said he , in my voyages , when i was a man and commanded other men , i have seen the heavens overcast , the sea rage and foam , the storm arise , and , like a monstrous bird , beating the two horizons with its wings .: 66.29
<S> yes , sir , continued the inspector of prisons .: 11.95
<S> milady perceived a bed ; she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas , but still further , her complexion .: 80.82
<S> adieu , my kind friends !: 47.34
<S> we will see , my dear monsieur , if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice box . you see plainly that i have no sword , said the englishman .: 33.16
<S> porthos , murmured d artagnan , look well at that priest . yes , said porthos , i see him .: 23.20
<S> that i am exceedingly disquieted , sire . really , have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine ? no , sire , for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and seven years of scarcity ; and with a king as full of foresight as your majesty , scarcity is not a thing to be feared . then of what other scourge are you afraid , my dear blacas ? sire , i have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the south . well , my dear duke , replied louis xviii. , i think you are wrongly informed , and know positively that , on the contrary , it is very fine weather in that direction . man of ability as he was , louis xviii .: 45.73
<S> they are the count of cha teau renaud , whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers , and whose ancestors had a place at the round table ; m. lucien debray , private secretary to the minister of the interior ; m. beauchamp , an editor of a paper , and the terror of the french government , but of whom , in spite of his national celebrity , you perhaps have not heard in italy , since his paper is prohibited there ; and m. maximilian morrel , captain of spahis . at this name the count , who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy , but at the same time with coldness and formality , stepped a pace forward , and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks .: 65.11
<S> on both sides loud cries arose on the one side cries of anger , on the other cries of enthusiasm .: 58.97
<S> i have proof of it .: 19.19
<S> caderousse , who had raised himself on his knees , and stretched out his arm , tried to draw back , then clasping his hands , and raising them with a desperate effort , oh , my god , my god ! said he , pardon me for having denied thee ; thou dost exist , thou art indeed man s father in heaven , and his judge on earth .: 28.25
<S> i do not wish to be taken by surprise , added the king .: 17.45
<S> edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors , from the brightest pink to the deepest blue ; and from time to time his cheeks flushed , his brow darkened , and a mist passed over his eyes .: 61.55
<S> you are not hurt ? asked d artagnan .: 13.47
<S> i never visit ministers ; i leave that to the princes . really , you were only before sparkling , but now you are brilliant ; take compassion on us , or , like jupiter , you will wither us up . i will not speak again , said cha teau renaud ; pray have compassion upon me , and do not take up every word i say . come , let us endeavor to get to the end of our story , beauchamp ; i told you that yesterday madame made inquiries of me upon the subject ; enlighten me , and i will then communicate my information to her . well , gentlemen , the reason people die so multitudinously i like the word at m. de villefort s is that there is an assassin in the house ! the two young men shuddered , for the same idea had more than once occurred to them .: 51.92
<S> you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary , compressed , marked up , nonproprietary or proprietary form , including any word processing or hypertext form .: 44.89
<S> you are aware , sir , of the deplorable condition of my husband s father ? yes , madame , m. de villefort spoke of it to me a paralysis , i think . alas , yes ; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless ; the mind alone is still active in this human machine , and that is faint and flickering , like the light of a lamp about to expire .: 44.99
<S> madame de villefort wiped his forehead , pressed her lips upon it , and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other .: 28.26
<S> i fancy i remember it .: 32.82
<S> the pistols were loaded ; he stretched forth his hand , took one up , and murmured his daughter s name .: 36.21
<S> i thought the assassin , having discovered the chest , and supposing it to be a treasure , had intended carrying it off , but , perceiving his error , had dug another hole , and deposited it there ; but i could find nothing .: 59.24
<S> ah , pardieu , tre ville !: 15.06
<S> you were saying , my dear friend no ; i said nothing . yes ; you were saying you wished to leave this place . ah , indeed !: 30.17
<S> with me you will be as safe as in a temple ; i give you my word of a gentleman . let us go , said she , i place full confidence in you , my friend ! d artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution , and both , light as shadows , glided through the interior door into the passage , ascended the stairs as quietly as possible , and entered d artagnan s chambers .: 36.68
<S> it signifies nothing whether you eat much or little whether you have ten dishes or one it is always the same price . what , still keeping up this silly jest ?: 142.86
<S> de chavigny , who , according to report , was a son of richelieu s , and had been a creature of the late cardinal s , understood tyranny .: 34.13
<S> aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion ; d artagnan , to be preparing his exordium .: 82.92
<S> a ray of moonlight poured through the trees , and lighted up the face of the dead .: 25.01
<S> we can talk of it afterward . then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the quai from the pont neuf to the quai saint michael , he raised his sword for them to double their speed .: 43.94
<S> on reaching home d artagnan found kitty waiting for him .: 28.05
<S> foolish creature , he exclaimed .: 54.24
<S> my friend , you impose a painful task on me .: 35.95
<S> if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement , you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg electronic works in your possession .: 11.53
<S> thou alarmest me ! said athos , who never used thee and thou but upon very particular occasions , what has happened ? look you , my friends ! cried d artagnan , a horrible suspicion crosses my mind !: 103.34
<S> i am parched with thirst .: 37.76
<S> do not let us despond , but wait at rueil , for my conviction is that they are at rueil .: 35.80
<S> we will talk over our travels ; and you , who have seen the whole world , will relate your adventures you shall tell us the history of the beautiful greek who was with you the other night at the opera , and whom you call your slave , and yet treat like a princess .: 54.81
<S> as all this , however , bore some resemblance to a duel , d artagnan began to recover himself little by little .: 46.20
<S> richelieu the cardinal , after having read these two lines , sank into a profound reverie ; but he did not return the paper to d artagnan .: 30.68
<S> at length he went to bed , fell asleep , and had golden dreams .: 30.34
<S> alas , murmured edmond ; can it be ? he moved his bed , drew up the stone , rushed into the passage , and reached the opposite extremity ; the secret entrance was open .: 25.26
<S> you understand me perfectly , on the contrary , said danglars : but , if you will persist , i will tell you that i have just lost 700,000 francs upon the spanish loan . and pray , asked the baroness , am i responsible for this loss ? why not ? is it my fault you have lost 700,000 francs ? certainly it is not mine . once for all , sir , replied the baroness sharply , i tell you i will not hear cash named ; it is a style of language i never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband . oh , i can well believe that , for neither of them was worth a penny . the better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank , which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night ; that noise of jingling crowns , which are constantly being counted and re counted , is odious to me .: 45.11
<S> in fifteen days at most , rochefort would be back ; besides , during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four friends .: 93.24
<S> it is unnecessary to say that from the day i saw raoul i loved him ; nevertheless , believe that i heartily pray that i may not become to him a father , however much i might be proud of such a son .: 58.22
<S> what ! he continued , can i have been following a false path ? can the end which i proposed be a mistaken end ? can one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible , if not a sacrilegious , undertaking ?: 126.33
<S> he gave no other name , answered julie , looking earnestly at the count , than that at the end of his letter sinbad the sailor . which is evidently not his real name , but a fictitious one . then , noticing that julie was struck with the sound of his voice : tell me , continued he , was he not about my height , perhaps a little taller , with his chin imprisoned , as it were , in a high cravat ; his coat closely buttoned up , and constantly taking out his pencil ? oh , do you then know him ? cried julie , whose eyes sparkled with joy .: 47.52
<S> ah , yes ; you look at my room , my four straw chairs , my images , three francs each .: 61.74
<S> yes , yes ; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit .: 48.94
<S> come with us to marseilles come along . i will not . what do you mean ?: 34.98
<S> his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence ; his lips were straight , and so thin that , as they closed , they were drawn in over the teeth ; his cheek bones were broad and projecting , a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness ; while the flatness of his forehead , and the enlargement of the back of his skull , which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears , combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing , save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable , more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt , and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole .: 93.72
<S> ah , you will tell all i have said , will you not , reverend sir ? yes , and much more . what more will you say ? i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house , in the hope the count would kill you .: 27.97
<S> one can no more now reckon on one s friends than on one s footmen , said porthos .: 67.52
<S> monte cristo raised his head once more , and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep .: 36.51
<S> will you take me away with you ?: 17.63
<S> let us go to rueil , said athos .: 8.73
<S> suddenly , about nine o clock in the evening , edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying .: 26.59
<S> when he had ended the perusal , he folded the letter and resumed his pensive attitude .: 48.13
<S> a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence , and which was given to me for you . but from whom is that letter ? oh , from some heartbroken waiting woman , some desponding grisette ; from madame de chevreuse s chambermaid , perhaps , who was obliged to return to tours with her mistress , and who , in order to appear smart and attractive , stole some perfumed paper , and sealed her letter with a duchess s coronet . what do you say ? hold !: 52.56
<S> what had become of him he cared not to inquire .: 30.16
<S> you will give them to your son , who will , of course , take great care of them . i should think so , indeed !: 29.17
<S> privately ? yes . well , i will remain with you . at this moment villefort returned , followed by the lady s maid ; and after her came madame de villefort .: 23.77
<S> bring her in , said the president .: 34.19
<S> this miserable strain confines me to my bed ; but mousqueton forages , and brings in provisions .: 168.02
<S> you , rochefort !: 29.82
<S> d artagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the king s musketeers , in which it was known he would one day take his place ; he was considered beforehand as a comrade .: 32.05
<S> thank you ! no , sir , neither of those ; something connected with this story . really ?: 68.28
<S> vitray , said he , you will go with all speed to london .: 21.41
<S> her first trial was lost ; she acted like a woman who reckons up her resources .: 64.84
<S> you are the king of lackeys .: 24.88
<S> he spoke italian like a tuscan , and spanish like a castilian ; he would have been free , and happy with merce de s and his father , whereas he was now confined in the cha teau d if , that impregnable fortress , ignorant of the future destiny of his father and merce de s ; and all this because he had trusted to villefort s promise .: 36.66
<S> then , having blown out the lights , the two fugitives , looking and listening eagerly , with outstretched necks , opened the door of a dressing room which led by a side staircase down to the yard , euge nie going first , and holding with one arm the portmanteau , which by the opposite handle mademoiselle d armilly scarcely raised with both hands .: 60.07
<S> although about forty four or forty five years old , she might have passed for thirty five .: 50.56
<S> in short , up to this period nothing had been wanting to tre ville but opportunity ; but he was ever on the watch for it , and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand .: 59.83
<S> valentine chapter 94 .: 33.95
<S> though i remember , in our affair of the rue fe rou , i received a sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the same effect . but this dinner was not intended for you alone , porthos ? said aramis .: 52.55
<S> one expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner : if i had listened to you , lord de winter had said to felton .: 43.80
<S> confided to me , it shall never escape my lips ; say , albert , my friend , do you wish it ? albert threw himself on beauchamp s neck .: 37.32
<S> do you hear not a single creature !: 46.35
<S> the first time he saw d artagnan , you have come off well , said he to him ; there is your jussac thrust paid for .: 46.19
<S> he no longer possessed strength , will , power , or feeling ; he followed where they led him .: 81.83
<S> this appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his intrusion .: 55.34
<S> the state , which is now threatened , would be safe , and you and i ? well you the cardinal would have given you letters of nobility . did he tell you so ? yes , i know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise . be satisfied , replied bonacieux ; my wife adores me , and there is yet time . the ninny ! murmured mme .: 44.11
<S> what in the devil does he say ? asked the prince .: 14.22
<S> a horse slips and injures a joint ; a horse stumbles and breaks his knees to the bone ; a horse eats out of a manger in which a glandered horse has eaten .: 98.05
<S> but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns , which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act .: 43.65
<S> he had passed the night standing , and without sleep .: 28.69
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other , and was about to cut up the fowl .: 25.48
<S> in royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at all .: 50.96
<S> yes , hell has resuscitated you , continued athos .: 32.85
<S> she declared that she would never assent to the treaty and that she wished eternal war .: 107.42
<S> some days before the return of the emperor , fernand was drafted .: 62.06
<S> at this moment a man entered , without even knocking at the door .: 15.44
<S> he wished to hasten their steps ; but athos took his arm and passed it under his own , and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend .: 20.93
<S> to own the truth , i should be inconsolable if you were to leave vincennes . a droll way of showing your affliction . the duke meant to say affection . but , my lord , returned la ramee , what would you do if you got out ?: 63.84
<S> villefort dictated a petition , in which , from an excellent intention , no doubt , dante s patriotic services were exaggerated , and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleon s return .: 48.16
<S> anne of austria was then twenty six or twenty seven years of age ; that is to say , she was in the full splendor of her beauty .: 17.93
<S> danglars followed his guide without opposition , and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him .: 40.56
<S> yes , replied the man , but at what a price ! listen , friend , said monte cristo .: 24.13
<S> the english do they dislike wine ? they hate it . but i have seen them drink it . as a punishment .: 87.58
<S> i pardon you , said he , the ill you have done me .: 22.05
<S> you tell me , said franz , at the moment signor pastrini was about to open his mouth , that you knew luigi vampa when he was a child he is still a young man , then ? a young man ?: 26.27
<S> albert and franz looked at each other , fearing really to abuse the count s kindness .: 39.05
<S> so much the better , young man !: 10.18
<S> do you see the waistcoat ?: 26.11
<S> do you see that ray of sunlight ? i do . well , the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you .: 34.04
<S> en route , gentlemen . and the troop , grumbling angrily , disappeared in the darkness and took the road to paris .: 51.29
<S> as for the duc de beaufort , he arrived from vendome , according to the annals of the day , bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair , qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the marketplaces .: 42.38
<S> the story volume two chapter 28 .: 80.09
<S> yes , but it was fated that i should not keep it . so , then , we are all right as regards the executioner , said athos ; but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant , his man , or whatever you call him . and this one had his , said d artagnan ; but , as good luck would have it , just as i thought i should have two affairs to manage , our friend was brought home with a broken leg .: 52.00
<S> at your service , sir , said planchet , overwhelmed with joy ; if i were still capable of serving you . perhaps so , replied d artagnan .: 21.04
<S> this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor , he stopped , laid down his pickaxe , seized his gun , mounted to the summit of the highest rock , and from thence gazed round in every direction .: 40.67
<S> the news caused a great sensation throughout the house ; madame de villefort would not believe it , and valentine was thunderstruck .: 38.89
<S> she cast anchor , clued up sails , and on the deck was captain gaumard giving orders , and good old penelon making signals to m. morrel .: 149.75
<S> what are you doing ? asked the coadjutor .: 6.39
<S> will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me ? thanks , count , no , replied de winter .: 21.20
<S> the brand of england ! it would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on me , and i could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the kingdom ; but the brand of france ! oh , by that , by that i was branded indeed ! this was too much for felton .: 55.83
<S> but , my good gentleman , resumed the old man , upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done , do not take on so ; they did not kill her , and that s a comfort . can you guess , said d artagnan , who was the man who headed this infernal expedition ? i don t know him . but as you spoke to him you must have seen him . oh , it s a description you want ? exactly so . a tall , dark man , with black mustaches , dark eyes , and the air of a gentleman . that s the man ! cried d artagnan , again he , forever he !: 44.90
<S> credit , owing to the reports afloat , was no longer to be had ; and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month , and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to m. de boville , m. morrel had , in reality , no hope but the return of the pharaon , of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time , and which had already arrived in harbor .: 37.65
<S> d artagnan , on his part , entered boldly at the principal gate .: 27.85
<S> acknowledge it , beauchamp ; your courage can not be doubted . not so , murmured the journalist ; on the contrary albert turned frightfully pale ; he endeavored to speak , but the words died on his lips .: 41.21
<S> the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property ?: 70.86
<S> isn t mousqueton there ? but he wears my livery ; my livery will be known , replied porthos .: 71.24
<S> what for ? that they may try , a month hence , to marry me again ; and to whom ? m .: 55.71
<S> at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified , not for myself for i , a simple corsican fisherman , had nothing to fear ; on the contrary , that time was most favorable for us smugglers but for my brother , a soldier of the empire , returning from the army of the loire , with his uniform and his epaulets , there was everything to apprehend .: 69.09
<S> the horses were at the place fixed upon , and they leaped lightly into their saddles .: 37.98
<S> what men call the chances of fate namely , ruin , change , circumstances i have fully anticipated , and if any of these should overtake me , yet it will not overwhelm me .: 90.50
<S> what do you mean ? i only mean that the count seems the rage , replied the viscount , smiling , and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the same question .: 28.36
<S> well , said the count , you do not get out , m. bertuccio you are going to stay in the carriage , then ?: 17.00
<S> this manoeuvre , transparent to the duc de beaufort , was quite unintelligible to la ramee .: 27.52
<S> yes , my poor girl , replied morrel ; i come to bring and to hear bad tidings . this is , indeed , a house of mourning , said valentine ; speak , maximilian , although the cup of sorrow seems already full . dear valentine , said morrel , endeavoring to conceal his own emotion , listen , i entreat you ; what i am about to say is very serious .: 35.56
<S> you must teach me a small part of what you know , said dante s , if only to prevent your growing weary of me .: 41.44
<S> i am brother to parry , his majesty s lackey . athos and aramis remembered that this was the name by which de winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the king s tent .: 28.28
<S> employ me in any other way ; employ me even actively , but let it be on the high roads . my dear monsieur de rochefort , mazarin replied in a tone of raillery , you think yourself still a young man ; your spirit is that of the phoenix , but your strength fails you .: 52.81
<S> a cold , sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches , and yet the drops fell from my forehead .: 88.18
<S> at all events , she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brother in law , with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily , rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy .: 41.62
<S> on !: 53.45
<S> adieu !: 28.11
<S> if you require to know positively what she is capable of , read her past history on her left shoulder . well , now that will do wonderfully well , said athos .: 50.92
<S> but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance , which nevertheless ought not to be omitted ; in one of the rooms he crossed , the trousseau of the bride elect was on exhibition .: 65.22
<S> suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name .: 46.91
<S> egad ! cried d artagnan , it s quite clear that the king and his escort have been by here . the devil ! said porthos ; in that case they have eaten everything . bah ! said d artagnan , they will have left a chicken , at least . he dismounted and knocked on the door .: 22.38
<S> he seized a rope which dante s flung to him , and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor , climbed up the side of the ship , while the young man , going to his task , left the conversation to danglars , who now came towards the owner .: 42.85
<S> parry , for his part , will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened . oh , juxon , said the king , seizing the bishop s two hands in his own , promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet , and for two others also , who , wherever they may be , are on the watch for my safety . sire , replied juxon , you shall be obeyed . meanwhile , the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly , when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage .: 69.55
<S> caderousse , meanwhile , continued to pace the room in gloomy silence , sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest ; but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast , the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it .: 39.75
<S> madame de saint me ran s last request was , that the marriage might not be delayed ; must i let things take their course ? noirtier did not move .: 53.21
<S> who wrote for particulars concerning my father ? i imagine anyone may write to yanina . but one person only wrote ! one only ? yes ; and that was you ! i , doubtless , wrote .: 133.78
<S> and then , you know , he said , an idea , a supposition , is sufficient . well , said monte cristo , you may believe me if you like , but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house . take care , said madame de villefort , the king s attorney is here . ah , replied monte cristo , since that is the case , i will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration . your declaration ? said villefort .: 17.81
<S> that is never done .: 26.67
<S> tis true ! thought the gascon , where has he heard it ?: 33.99
<S> ha !: 25.83
<S> come !: 17.12
<S> the next day , m. dessessart s valet came to d artagnan s lodging , and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres .: 30.11
<S> still , as i have already told you , i have an instinctive affection for him , the source of which i can not explain to you .: 14.94
<S> as i told you , everything can be attained , porthos , women and doors , by proceeding with gentleness . you re a great moralist , and that s the fact , said porthos .: 53.51
<S> merciful goodness ! whispered aramis to athos , did you see ? what ? asked athos .: 34.70
<S> one day , however , an emissary of the cardinal s gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often .: 34.72
<S> two men , whom you will find at the door on going out , will serve you as escort .: 42.28
<S> he had taken the lady as far as fromelles ; and from fromelles she had set out for armentie res .: 48.94
<S> oh , it is impossible ! utterly impossible ! what i have said , i have said , answered caderousse .: 24.78
<S> after shutting the gate behind them , i pretended to return to the house , but i immediately went out a back door , and stealing along in the shade of the hedge , i gained yonder clump of elder , from which i could hear and see everything .: 55.46
<S> well , i will avenge you of this wretch , replied d artagnan , giving himself the airs of don japhet of armenia .: 32.72
<S> and when you have found the culprit , if you find him , i will say to you , you are a magistrate , do as you will ! i thank you , doctor , said villefort with indescribable joy ; i never had a better friend than you . and , as if he feared doctor d avrigny would recall his promise , he hurried him towards the house .: 33.38
<S> he shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future .: 45.60
<S> i will come and ask mine at eleven o clock this evening .: 21.25
<S> she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room , with her legs crossed under her in the eastern fashion , and seemed to have made for herself , as it were , a kind of nest in the rich indian silks which enveloped her .: 40.22
<S> and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared , completely hidden between them .: 54.48
<S> diavolaccio , seeing himself thus favored by fortune , burst into a loud laugh .: 91.91
<S> yes , you talk like a child i repeat the word .: 38.57
<S> soon the water rushes out of the scupper holes like a whale spouting , the vessel gives a last groan , spins round and round , and disappears , forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean , and then all is over , so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of god can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea .: 83.55
<S> this poor fellow , whom caderousse had forgotten , had not forgotten him , and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him . but how did he obtain it ? asked the jeweller ; had he it before he was imprisoned ? no , monsieur ; but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman , and as in prison he fell sick , and dante s took the same care of him as if he had been his brother , the englishman , when he was set free , gave this stone to dante s , who , less fortunate , died , and , in his turn , left it to us , and charged the excellent abbe , who was here this morning , to deliver it . the same story , muttered the jeweller ; and improbable as it seemed at first , it may be true .: 38.98
<S> but , first of all , how are madeleine and antoinette ? madeleine was the daughter of m. d avrigny , and antoinette his niece .: 39.74
<S> what on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog ? exclaimed porthos .: 52.10
<S> never mind , i ll fix that all right .: 40.51
<S> i would rather do so , was edmond s reply , than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me . the patron turned towards his vessel , which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor , and , with sails partly set , would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed .: 120.67
<S> he was , then , a more unhappy son than you , morrel , for he could not even find his father s grave . but then he had the woman he loved still remaining ? you are deceived , morrel , that woman she was dead ? worse than that , she was faithless , and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed .: 43.09
<S> all his sorrows , all his sufferings , with their train of gloomy spectres , fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter .: 73.43
<S> faria has dreamed this ; the cardinal spada buried no treasure here ; perhaps he never came here , or if he did , c sar borgia , the intrepid adventurer , the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer , has followed him , discovered his traces , pursued them as i have done , raised the stone , and descending before me , has left me nothing . he remained motionless and pensive , his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet .: 65.50
<S> d artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered , and found athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance , and beginning to grow uneasy .: 30.82
<S> well , i would secure for myself a fortune independent of him , even if i acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him . madame danglars blushed , in spite of all her efforts .: 52.32
<S> danglars fancied that they had reached the long desired point ; he opened his eyes and looked through the window , expecting to find himself in the midst of some town , or at least village ; but he saw nothing except what seemed like a ruin , where three or four men went and came like shadows .: 51.22
<S> let us return to my ring , or rather to yours .: 29.44
<S> bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man .: 19.79
<S> he held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance , and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable : oh ! with such an expression of extreme terror that mousqueton started , alarmed , and blaisois was near fainting from fright .: 75.56
<S> news from your father , do you hear , henrietta ?: 48.71
<S> i believe so , replied aramis .: 11.31
<S> well ? demanded d artagnan .: 9.09
<S> should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers , able enough to turn it over again , or if not , to hold on by it .: 110.24
<S> i will leave him at the place i quit , and he will conduct you to me . and you say you will wait for me at armentie res ? at armentie res . write that name on a bit of paper , lest i should forget it .: 26.80
<S> then , when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air , they separated their flocks , and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position .: 43.32
<S> d artagnan was standing at the door looking after porthos with a mournful gaze , when the baron , after walking scarcely more than twenty paces , returned stood still struck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed : i recollect ! what ? inquired d artagnan .: 48.55
<S> and now that we are acquainted , superficially at least , with the masters and the valets , let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of them .: 51.66
<S> there are no extravagant hopes but for fools , monsieur , and you are a man of understanding .: 39.07
<S> albert took the letter , opened , and read it , then looked round for bertuccio , but he was gone .: 29.95
<S> i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me .: 64.92
<S> and that mysterious staircase , the passage through which , not to disturb their sleep , the doctor and nurse pass , or even the father carrying the sleeping child ? here madame danglars , instead of being calmed by the soft picture , uttered a groan and fainted .: 78.19
<S> just heaven , what have i read ? cried the duke .: 31.36
<S> my spirit is willing , my head is clear , but this demon , the gout , o ercrows me .: 98.21
<S> he should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till half past eleven ; it is twelve , and , tired of waiting , he must have gone on . it is likely . well , will you try and overtake him ? nothing i should like better . if you do not overtake him before we reach bourget you shall have twenty francs ; if not before louvres , thirty . and if we do overtake him ? forty , said andrea , after a moment s hesitation , at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise .: 43.08
<S> oh , no , monsieur , replied monte cristo ; i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar .: 21.08
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> and who are you ? eh , pardieu ! joannes , the jeweller . well , and you said i offended the good god , said la carconte with a horrid smile .: 36.67
<S> i could not see the expression of his countenance , but i felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed .: 28.78
<S> every one hoped so , so that the minister felt that all around him , beneath the homage of the courtiers , lay a fund of hatred , ill disguised by fear and interest .: 96.10
<S> but he was a man of stone .: 18.36
<S> then he let his head sink upon his two hands , while d artagnan stood before him , stupefied .: 16.93
<S> de chevreuse .: 23.96
<S> she is to correspond with nobody ; she is to speak to no one but you if you will do her the honor to address a word to her . that is sufficient , my lord !: 37.25
<S> we and his majesty will lead the second .: 76.38
<S> i was worn out with fatigue .: 21.84
<S> does it happen to be jacopo manfredi ? exactly so .: 52.57
<S> however , he remained standing , clinging to a window .: 21.86
<S> that is not difficult .: 24.14
<S> poor young man , said monte cristo in a low voice ; it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation . meanwhile albert had revived , and , continuing to read , he threw back his head , saying : florentin , is your horse fit to return immediately ? it is a poor , lame post horse . in what state was the house when you left ? all was quiet , but on returning from m. beauchamp s , i found madame in tears ; she had sent for me to know when you would return .: 52.95
<S> crown pieces only silver pieces !: 1135.70
<S> their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world , and they only spoke in broken words , which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow .: 79.74
<S> there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards .: 109.20
<S> it was then three o clock in the morning .: 6.13
<S> the order is positive .: 47.13
<S> i am not willing that a compatriot , a handsome cavalier , a brave youth , quite fit to make his way , should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it .: 46.71
<S> you watch while i sleep and you have come to bring me some news ? alas , sire , answered athos , your majesty has guessed aright . it is bad news ? yes , sire . never mind ; the messenger is welcome .: 37.05
<S> i tell you , marquis , my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first , for the king will not forget the service i do him . in that case go and get ready .: 54.06
<S> do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat ? aramis rushed after the fugitive hat .: 54.36
<S> nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor .: 183.63
<S> madame broussel , separated by the width of the table from her husband , burst into tears , and the young girls clung to their father s arms .: 37.50
<S> this letter told buckingham that the city was at an extremity ; but instead of adding , if your succor does not arrive within fifteen days , we will surrender , it added , quite simply , if your succor comes not within fifteen days , we shall all be dead with hunger when it comes . the rochellais , then , had no hope but in buckingham .: 86.66
<S> then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age , even when they are torn with remorse .: 47.59
<S> i declare , i expect to look magnificent in it , and chose that regiment only from vanity . merce de s sighed while endeavoring to smile ; the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son .: 77.81
<S> they advanced , and athos , who was the first to enter , gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face , framed in its long and now untidy , matted hair , the blue veins showing through the transparent temples , his eyes seemingly swollen by tears .: 73.49
<S> how , sire ? cried the young queen , affecting surprise , you are giving me , then , two more : i shall have fourteen . in fact the king counted them , and the twelve studs were all on her majesty s shoulder .: 47.56
<S> it is impossible to say whether charles , who kept his eyes constantly closed , had noticed the insolence of the puritan captain , but the moment he heard the clear tone of d artagnan s voice his eyelids rose , in spite of himself .: 44.84
<S> the pharaon ! he cried ; the pharaon ! what ! what ! the pharaon !: 38.38
<S> if by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named mordaunt , tell porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck .: 78.33
<S> i have that honor , your excellency . you had a new livery yesterday ? yes , sir . i have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening , and do not wish to be known ; lend me your livery till tomorrow .: 38.49
<S> france has already received queen henrietta , and , unintentionally , doubtless , has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country .: 130.72
<S> it is not true , said milady , in a tone of voice so firm , and with a countenance so unchanged , that if d artagnan had not been in such perfect possession of the fact , he would have doubted .: 19.96
<S> this is torture to me , cried athos .: 19.85
<S> the noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoofs .: 32.25
<S> madame , i never eat muscatel grapes , replied monte cristo , as if the subject had not been mentioned before .: 24.09
<S> alas , my friends , replied m. morrel , with a mournful shake of his head , the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected . oh , indeed indeed , sir , he is innocent ! sobbed forth merce de s .: 39.58
<S> he applied his imitative powers to everything , and , like giotto , when young , he drew on his slate sheep , houses , and trees .: 90.54
<S> he checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on , his head drooping as if in deep thought .: 45.95
<S> the soldiers looked at dante s with an air of stupid curiosity .: 18.38
<S> that woman had , in all probability , poisoned my brother , and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn .: 32.07
<S> that is not probable . it is possible , said milady .: 12.21
<S> during the scene of tumult , andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly ; then , leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock , in the most graceful attitude possible , he said : gentlemen , i assure you i had no idea of insulting the court , or of making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly .: 45.54
<S> sit down , and let us talk it over . milady ! murmured athos .: 27.77
<S> the youth brought a small loaf .: 74.96
<S> unable to have me for your wife , you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister ; and besides , she added , her eyes troubled and moistened with tears , wait , wait , fernand ; you said just now that the sea was treacherous , and he has been gone four months , and during these four months there have been some terrible storms . fernand made no reply , nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of merce de s , although for each of these tears he would have shed his heart s blood ; but these tears flowed for another .: 50.49
<S> hayde e scarcely had the count s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard , when albert , turning towards the count , burst into a loud fit of laughter much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural .: 52.56
<S> your fellow countryman , bonaparte , became emperor . we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican .: 77.70
<S> three arcades were before them , and the middle one was used as a door .: 57.51
<S> the young shepherd stopped , as if his feet had been rooted to the ground ; then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder , took aim at the ravisher , followed him for a second in his track , and then fired .: 29.20
<S> questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made dante s indignant , for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbe a love and respect equal to his own .: 71.40
<S> let us go , repeated d artagnan .: 7.20
<S> i may be mistaken , but i believe that raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could display . the remembrance of milady recurred to d artagnan .: 66.00
<S> wretch ! said he to the young man , who since the death of buckingham had regained that coolness and self possession which never after abandoned him , wretch !: 61.77
<S> under the cuirass the hump will not be seen .: 45.25
<S> still it belongs to government , and i ought not to waste it ; but , having received the signal that i might rest for an hour here he glanced at the sun dial , for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhe ry , even a sun dial , and having ten minutes before me , and my strawberries being ripe , when a day longer by the by , sir , do you think dormice eat them ? indeed , i should think not , replied monte cristo ; dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved , as the romans did . what ?: 64.45
<S> the clear and vigorous intellect of athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would be .: 142.46
<S> at these words he took up a silver bell , and rang it ; the officer entered .: 28.82
<S> wait ! said aramis ; that is an idea ! of which i invite you to take advantage , my friend .: 32.72
<S> cavalcanti , being left alone , turned to monte cristo .: 30.52
<S> arrest the prime minister of king charles i. !: 79.48
<S> the young count s conversation was most interesting to raoul , therefore he listened much , whilst the count talked well and long .: 98.91
<S> he approached the block and laid his axe upon it .: 48.94
<S> he goes two or three times a week . dost thou know noisy well ? i think so , truly ; my nurse lives there . is there a convent at noisy ? isn t there a great and grand one the convent of jesuits ? what is thy name ? friquet . d artagnan wrote the child s name in his tablets .: 86.35
<S> he then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four and twenty hours .: 33.20
<S> come , now that we are alone , said athos , let us talk of yourself . whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves , replied de winter .: 20.55
<S> had that letter fallen into the hands of another , you , my dear father , would probably ere this have been shot . villefort s father laughed .: 74.68
<S> and , sir , where does he reside , pray ? the comte de la fere lodges in the rue guenegaud , hotel du grand roi charlemagne . thanks , sir .: 26.50
<S> you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg works .: 23.92
<S> he saw in the young man his natural successor , and regretted that he had not a daughter , that he might have bound edmond to him by a more secure alliance .: 48.69
<S> come , collect yourself , and tell me all . i have related it but once , and that was to the abbe busoni .: 24.79
<S> you understand no more delay . yes , sir , i will give my attention to the subject . i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision , but i do await it .: 32.31
<S> the servant understood them .: 48.42
<S> afterward ? afterward ?: 1121.35
<S> d artagnan preferred the second means , and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired .: 71.72
<S> hardly had the door closed when villefort threw himself half fainting into a chair .: 51.53
<S> did you really think me capable of that ? at least , said the abbe , i now see how wrong such an opinion would have been .: 31.61
<S> oh , sir , said danglars , after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held , and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him , three letters of unlimited credit !: 53.28
<S> he had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door , and maximilian and emmanuel , who had considerately passed forward a few steps , thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within .: 50.17
<S> then following the clew that , in the hands of the abbe faria , had been so skilfully used to guide him through the d dalian labyrinth of probabilities , he thought that the cardinal spada , anxious not to be watched , had entered the creek , concealed his little barque , followed the line marked by the notches in the rock , and at the end of it had buried his treasure .: 60.07
<S> la jeune ame lie had a very active crew , very obedient to their captain , who lost as little time as possible .: 71.32
<S> if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence , we are ready to obey you .: 33.82
<S> you think he is tracked , pursued , captured ; he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles .: 54.18
<S> what do you wish for ?: 9.46
<S> he was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep .: 57.09
<S> morrel rushed forward to tear it from him , but monte cristo perceiving his intention , seized his wrist with his iron grasp .: 52.12
<S> the intelligent creature was received with loud applause .: 69.04
<S> are we not going ? said he , after this embarrassing silence .: 27.35
<S> everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey .: 134.33
<S> his next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers .: 52.37
<S> yes , you !: 17.12
<S> you want me to throw again , do you not ? no , i would wish you to reflect . on what ? you mean to take your horse ? without doubt . you are wrong , then .: 25.10
<S> oh , that is very good indeed , it is very good ! said louise , looking at her with admiration ; but that beautiful black hair , those magnificent braids , which made all the ladies sigh with envy , will they go under a man s hat like the one i see down there ? you shall see , said euge nie .: 57.41
<S> wealth does not necessarily produce happiness .: 118.95
<S> he had on his estates the rights of high and low tribunals .: 73.91
<S> really , said planchet .: 17.15
<S> not one of them will do as he says , he murmured , with his little monkey smile ; but they may do as they please , the brave gentlemen !: 39.89
<S> instantly a mask , wearing the well known costume of a peasant woman , snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance .: 104.38
<S> at the very moment when i was about to pay you , i had placed my purse on the table . yes , monsieur . that purse contained sixty pistoles ; where is it ? deposited with the justice ; they said it was bad money . very well ; get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles . but monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold of .: 65.26
<S> and on this assurance , the four friends , who had finished their modest repast , separated , with the promise of meeting again that evening .: 51.19
<S> but even while they watched his daring progress , edmond s foot slipped , and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear .: 66.20
<S> what would your excellency like ? and peppino placed his pan on the ground , so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of danglars .: 60.35
<S> give me your arm , and let us go . very well , let us go , said caderousse ; but i don t want your arm at all .: 13.58
<S> as we pass from one room to another , i will open the windows to let you breathe . monte cristo had already seen the breakfast room and the salon on the ground floor .: 44.46
<S> monte cristo felt his limbs tremble ; he seated himself upon a log of wood .: 32.72
<S> but aramis bent his head the instant he saw the duke s finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him .: 51.50
<S> between the forest and this accursed spot , a little behind the trampled ground , was the same track of small feet as in the garden ; the carriage had stopped here .: 70.12
<S> i am a priest , resumed aramis .: 10.98
<S> and why , if you knew me , do you let me die ? because nothing can save you ; your wounds are mortal .: 29.65
<S> he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die , said the gascon to himself .: 31.73
<S> then the cardinal , whatever he said , very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter , in which frenchman would combat against frenchman , was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy ; and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress .: 85.00
<S> both orleans and montargis are ours .: 183.18
<S> we must seize the felucca , said aramis .: 24.40
<S> like a philosopher . danglars returned at this moment alone .: 61.68
<S> sir , said he , up to this time and it is now more than four and twenty years since i received the direction of this house from my father , who had himself conducted it for five and thirty years never has anything bearing the signature of morrel son been dishonored . i know that , replied the englishman .: 40.63
<S> you yourself gave me this comb . i was very wrong , my lord , for in giving it to you i acted in opposition to my orders . the duke looked furiously at grimaud .: 40.95
<S> athos , with his superior understanding , wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion , and at the moment when his friends , in deference to his deportment and sobriety , dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners , he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and manners a freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables .: 105.95
<S> touch me not ! said the executioner ; if this dagger is withdrawn i shall die . grimaud remained with his hand extended ; then , striking his forehead , he exclaimed : oh !: 45.44
<S> it is your new master , my good fellow , said the footman .: 20.14
<S> he turned round ; it was danglars .: 26.30
<S> d artagnan resolved to try and enter the louvre .: 21.35
<S> i should like , however , to know what this letter addressed to tre ville contains . and the stranger , muttering to himself , directed his steps toward the kitchen .: 35.59
<S> mine host s face does not please me at all ; it is too gracious . nor me either , said athos .: 71.07
<S> yes , replied the abbe , it is very affecting . merce de s came again , and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home .: 25.72
<S> what were you doing ? replied she .: 12.61
<S> i see that i have made a trifling mistake , as you say ; but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon , that you may drink to my health , and be able to ask your messmates to join you . so extreme was the surprise of the sailor , that he was unable even to thank edmond , whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment .: 62.90
<S> why , you sell yourself , body and soul , to the demon , the devil , for money ! no , to the cardinal . it s the same thing , cried the young woman .: 31.92
<S> has bedeau been killed ?: 83.36
<S> ask that woman , said the man in the red cloak , for you may plainly see she knows me ! the executioner of lille , the executioner of lille ! cried milady , a prey to insensate terror , and clinging with her hands to the wall to avoid falling .: 42.99
<S> d artagnan , on the contrary , quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy , approached the young men with a profound bow , accompanied by a most gracious smile .: 25.79
<S> i will tell them to send her to you . villefort returned , and d avrigny met him in the passage .: 20.01
<S> it neither increased nor decreased my income . albert felt the blood mounting to his brow ; there was no doubt upon the subject .: 73.54
<S> d artagnan , d artagnan ! cried mme .: 8.39
<S> i am twenty one years old , or rather i shall be in a few days , as i was born the night of the 27th of september , 1817. m. de villefort , who was busy taking down some notes , raised his head at the mention of this date .: 33.96
<S> come , come , continued the count , complaints are unavailing , be a man , be strong , be full of hope , for i am here and will watch over you . morrel shook his head sorrowfully .: 30.32
<S> the sentinel was unwilling to leave his post , but allowed parry to pass .: 26.14
<S> what do you say ? i say that it was you who gave me the wine ; i say that it was you who desired me to drink it .: 13.74
<S> besides , you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed . at what ?: 34.98
<S> good bye .: 30.43
<S> how ?: 28.72
<S> come , sir , said comminges , make haste ; you must obey the king . sir , said broussel , i am in bad health and can not give myself up a prisoner in this state ; i must have time . it is impossible , said comminges ; the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant . impossible ! said louvieres ; sir , beware of driving us to despair . impossible ! cried a shrill voice from the end of the room .: 39.42
<S> you see , we had each our mission , said porthos ; mine was to guard you and i am doing so .: 57.13
<S> who are you ? asked the man .: 8.32
<S> i think he has only been introduced to madame de villefort . still , he ought to have been here , said debray ; i wonder what will be talked about tonight ; this funeral is the news of the day .: 39.30
<S> for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs , while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven .: 79.08
<S> baptistin re entered with glasses , wine , and biscuits .: 76.23
<S> they believe me her accomplice , and will punish me with her .: 58.22
<S> during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastile where he remained for twelve long years when his companions , in their dreams of liberty , said to each other : as for me , i shall go out of the prison at such a time , and another , at such and such a time , the duke used to answer , as for me , gentlemen , i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves ; meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the bastile and de bassompierre regain his at court .: 59.66
<S> his tongue was paralyzed in his mouth .: 30.43
<S> i am lost , murmured she ; i am lost !: 17.56
<S> but to you , at least , m. debray , i need not give a further description , because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known .: 50.11
<S> as a result of the sympathetic devotion which jacopo had from the first bestowed on edmond , the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection .: 58.33
<S> d avrigny , who attends my mother , declares he is in despair about it .: 65.24
<S> at his house rebellion could be planned with impunity , for , as we have said , since that morning he had ceased to be the queen s invalid . as to raoul , he had attended the duchess to her carriage , where , as she took her seat , she gave him her hand to kiss ; then , by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous , she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead , saying : vicomte , may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune ! then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes .: 42.65
<S> the musketeer was introduced to m. coquenard , whose little gray eyes sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new .: 61.14
<S> i have a son too , and i should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months voyage . then i have your leave , sir ? yes , if you have nothing more to say to me . nothing . captain leclere did not , before he died , give you a letter for me ? he was unable to write , sir .: 44.42
<S> here i am , dear count . welcome home again . i arrived an hour since . from dieppe ? no , from tre port . indeed ? and i have come at once to see you . that is extremely kind of you , said monte cristo with a tone of perfect indifference .: 32.93
<S> during this time , edmond , seated on his bed with his head in his hands , tried to collect his scattered thoughts .: 28.83
<S> what i mean to say is this , sir , that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred excuse me , said morcerf , but is it a play we are acting ? a play ? yes , for it is like one ; pray let us come more to the point , and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other . that is quite my desire . you have seen m. de monte cristo have you not ? i see him very often , said danglars , drawing himself up ; he is a particular friend of mine . well , in one of your late conversations with him , you said that i appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage , did you not ? i did say so . well , here i am , proving at once that i am really neither the one nor the other , by entreating you to keep your promise on that score . danglars did not answer .: 49.68
<S> but he will not avow it . how so ? because they failed . your honor gave me two of these frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for charles i .: 63.69
<S> then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you , since for the moment you have no master but god ? it is possible . have you , my dear aramis , thought sometimes of those happy , happy , happy days of youth we passed laughing , drinking , and fighting each other for play ? certainly , and more than once regretted them ; it was indeed a glorious time . well , those splendidly wild days may chance to come again ; i am commissioned to find out my companions and i began by you , who were the very soul of our society . aramis bowed , rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment .: 91.66
<S> moreover , he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures .: 98.54
<S> partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me , partly to supply the wants of the poor widow , i eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler , which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution .: 71.75
<S> she prevailed upon him to leave the country ; but to leave the country , to fly together , to reach another part of france , where they might live at ease because unknown , money was necessary .: 68.77
<S> two days will be a different thing , said danglars , smiling .: 18.23
<S> albert related it to his mother ; cha teau renaud recounted it at the jockey club , and debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister ; even beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the count s courage and gallantry , thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy .: 62.18
<S> order a larded hare , a fat capon , mutton leg dressed with garlic , and four bottles of old burgundy . bazin , who looked at his master , without comprehending the cause of this change , in a melancholy manner , allowed the omelet to slip into the spinach , and the spinach onto the floor .: 60.42
<S> to form the slightest idea of his feelings , one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tear moistened eyes raised to heaven .: 91.14
<S> it is upon one higher placed than i am that god has laid this responsibility . to you no , to you alone !: 143.73
<S> dante s saw that he was looked upon as dangerous .: 37.04
<S> then they allow the lackey to remain with him ? yes ; stuart begged this favor and harrison consented .: 100.61
<S> what am i to do ? she said , bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant .: 32.62
<S> as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions !: 90.03
<S> sire , said the queen , i can send for them to the louvre , where they are , and thus your majesty s wishes will be complied with . do so , madame , do so , and that at once ; for within an hour the ballet will commence . the queen bent in token of submission , and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room .: 27.67
<S> parry had not quitted his master , and since his condemnation had not ceased to weep .: 35.87
<S> let us not misunderstand each other , replied monte cristo ; i introduce no one , and certainly not m. cavalcanti . and who , said albert with a forced smile , is to marry mademoiselle danglars instead of me , which grieves me cruelly . what ?: 34.57
<S> there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans , and eight days after the wedding they left marseilles . did you ever see merce de s again ? inquired the priest .: 48.46
<S> but to die ?: 58.05
<S> you thought yourselves alone , and talked about that tragical death , and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of valentine . villefort and d avrigny exchanged looks .: 73.42
<S> what do you say of this ? asked the queen .: 4.95
<S> taste of this ; it is a spanish wine which our friend athos thought much of . at that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been proposed .: 72.66
<S> let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream , said beauchamp ; let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper , and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes . yes , yes , said albert , and may there remain only the eternal friendship which i promised to my deliverer , which shall be transmitted to our children s children , and shall always remind me that i owe my life and the honor of my name to you , for had this been known , oh , beauchamp , i should have destroyed myself ; or , no , my poor mother !: 71.06
<S> i once knew a bragelonne is he still alive ? no , sir , he is dead ; and i believe it is from him my guardian , whose near relation he was , inherited the estate from which i take my name . and your guardian , sir , asked the queen , who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her , what is his name ? the comte de la fere , madame , replied the young man , bowing .: 35.62
<S> it was the end of november , all the verdure of the garden had disappeared , the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms , and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet .: 50.99
<S> i was sure of it the cursed letter ! don t be afraid , you idiot ; there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure . ah , like the charming journey the other day , when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps ! well , if you are really afraid , monsieur planchet , resumed d artagnan , i will go without you .: 51.57
<S> when mazarin ceased speaking he said to porthos in a low tone : never tell mazarin that i understand spanish , or i am a lost man and you are also . all right , said porthos .: 61.65
<S> oh ! and do you know who is his lieutenant ? his lieutenant ?: 37.56
<S> it would be exceedingly droll . the gascon , with his vivid imagination , had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation .: 43.87
<S> hem , replied d artagnan .: 17.91
<S> three or four times he has said to me , and certainly without the slightest premeditation , at such a period i was five years old , at another ten years old , at another twelve , and i , induced by curiosity , which kept me alive to these details , have compared the dates , and never found him inaccurate .: 55.71
<S> he s my friend , and this morning offered to share his money with me , as i shared mine with him .: 46.82
<S> you have no idea , my dear fellow , how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents , or what evil ways all these men of the church have , with whom i am obliged to live .: 68.76
<S> albert was not deceived , for the next evening franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner .: 58.81
<S> yes , and that s all settled ! exclaimed caderousse , who , by a last effort of intellect , had followed the reading of the letter , and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail .: 40.87
<S> but these 200 francs ? here they are , and 200 more besides .: 80.54
<S> but the inheritance consisted in this only , a scrap of paper on which spada had written : i bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers , my books , and , amongst others , my breviary with the gold corners , which i beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle . the heirs sought everywhere , admired the breviary , laid hands on the furniture , and were greatly astonished that spada , the rich man , was really the most miserable of uncles no treasures unless they were those of science , contained in the library and laboratories .: 105.55
<S> in the first , blazed piles of golden coin ; in the second , were ranged bars of unpolished gold , which possessed nothing attractive save their value ; in the third , edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds , pearls , and rubies , which , as they fell on one another , sounded like hail against glass .: 83.01
<S> so he cherishes no resentment ? you are mistaken , porthos , said d artagnan .: 29.04
<S> the bed was the only one in the apartment , which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom .: 31.65
<S> the assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man , they should be accused by him ; therefore their first idea was to join the enemy .: 83.55
<S> i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of yanina , fatigued with long service here hayde e cast a significant glance at monte cristo , whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative .: 49.15
<S> but , under the present circumstances , i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who , because he hated the father , vents his anger on the son .: 47.83
<S> a hundred writers since socrates , seneca , st. augustine , and gall , have made , in verse and prose , the comparison you have made , and yet i can well understand that a father s sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son .: 76.44
<S> the eight oars fell at once into the sea , making but a single sound , giving but a single stroke , and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the water .: 36.80
<S> you know what athos told you the other day ; you eat at everybody s mess .: 73.10
<S> i understand ; you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject .: 37.88
<S> dante s examined it with intense admiration , then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form .: 54.50
<S> permit me to inform you , count , said he , bowing , that i have received a letter of advice from thomson french , of rome . i am glad to hear it , baron , for i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants .: 25.17
<S> when he had passed one group he began to breathe more freely ; but he could not help observing that they turned round to look at him , and for the first time in his life d artagnan , who had till that day entertained a very good opinion of himself , felt ridiculous .: 41.20
<S> and all this all this , because my heart , which i thought dead , was only sleeping ; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again , because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman s voice .: 69.31
<S> he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water it was the general s body , which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead .: 44.45
<S> you were right , he said , my dear monsieur d artagnan , and you can not set out yet .: 16.44
<S> rob your master , eat his sweetmeats , and drink his wine ; but , by jove !: 97.18
<S> ah , monseigneur , do not mention it ! cried the host , in the most pitiable voice imaginable .: 14.33
<S> when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two mazarinists , it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass .: 45.94
<S> my dear albert , said he , let me introduce to you m. maximilian morrel , captain of spahis , my friend ; and what is more however the man speaks for himself my preserver .: 49.37
<S> my intention was to inform monsieur laporte , through my husband , in order that monsieur laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the louvre in the last three days , and whether there is any danger in presenting myself there . but i , said d artagnan , can go and inform monsieur laporte . no doubt you could , only there is one misfortune , and that is that monsieur bonacieux is known at the louvre , and would be allowed to pass ; whereas you are not known there , and the gate would be closed against you . ah , bah ! said d artagnan ; you have at some wicket of the louvre a concierge who is devoted to you , and who , thanks to a password , would mme .: 44.71
<S> then among them glided like a pure ray , like a christian angel in the midst of olympus , one of those chaste figures , those calm shadows , those soft visions , which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons .: 90.02
<S> each one , stretching out his hand to the bag , took his seventy five pistoles , and made his preparations to set out at the time appointed .: 28.96
<S> why , he left marseilles , and was taken , on the recommendation of m. morrel , who did not know his crime , as cashier into a spanish bank .: 39.70
<S> curiosity prevailed over prudence ; and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene , he stole from his hiding place , and quick as lightning , but stepping with utmost caution , he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall , from which his eye could pierce the interior of aramis s room .: 43.61
<S> to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org donate .: 47.00
<S> we must fire as long as we have loaded guns .: 43.51
<S> i will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself . the doctor pressed valentine s hand , and while he visited her grandmother , she descended the steps .: 25.77
<S> you are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days .: 116.08
<S> faith , said aramis , laughing , we have praised the dead enough , let us revile the living a little ; i should like to say something evil of mazarin ; is it permissible ? go on , go on , replied d artagnan , laughing heartily ; relate your story and i will applaud it if it is a good one . a great prince , said aramis , with whom mazarin sought an alliance , was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him .: 42.73
<S> now , planchet has an excellent memory ; and i will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance , he will allow himself to be beaten to death .: 54.13
<S> one of the notaries sat down , the other remained standing .: 21.92
<S> the abbess only crossed herself , without approving or disapproving .: 136.70
<S> have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from yours . good , answered harrison .: 99.69
<S> mousqueton remained glued to the door , awaiting the explanation of this strange occurrence .: 48.17
<S> nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles belief ; the last month s payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude ; cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash , and the same evening he had brought them to m. morrel , who , with a melancholy smile , threw them into an almost empty drawer , saying : thanks , cocles ; you are the pearl of cashiers . cocles went away perfectly happy , for this eulogium of m. morrel , himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles , flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns .: 69.86
<S> la ramee , some day when he sends for you , you must let me put on your clothes ; i will go in your stead ; i will strangle him , and upon my honor , if that is made a condition i will return to prison . monseigneur , i see well that i must call grimaud . well , i am wrong .: 35.01
<S> we mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues distant . athos placed his two hands on d artagnan s shoulders , and gazed at him with his calm , sad smile .: 40.67
<S> i do not jest , said athos .: 10.08
<S> god who knows all , knows without doubt ; but as for me , i accuse nobody . oh , what an abyss ; what an abyss ! cried felton .: 60.55
<S> why , then , have you laid it aside ? because , remembering the scene at armentieres , i thought i should find four axes for one , as i was to meet four executioners . sir , replied d artagnan , in the calmest manner possible , you are very young ; i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks .: 42.46
<S> once upon a time well , go on . signor pastrini turned toward franz , who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two ; we must do him justice , he had had a great many frenchmen in his house , but had never been able to comprehend them .: 45.18
<S> well , wait for the miracle i hope to accomplish , or or ? repeated morrel .: 78.02
<S> help !: 33.86
<S> the day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution i had formed ; only i took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart , for i had no doubt i was watched .: 50.98
<S> he cast his eyes around , and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him .: 36.07
<S> i understand you , fernand ; you would be revenged on him because i do not love you ; you would cross your catalan knife with his dirk .: 48.65
<S> here ! you decide , then , nothing about me , my lord ? on the contrary , i have come to a decision . bernouin came into the room .: 21.96
<S> the duke , however , overcame all difficulties with a word his majesty s order ; and , in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles , villefort was introduced .: 48.00
<S> the two grooms held the horses , that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled , and grimaud was posted as sentinel .: 37.95
<S> you must make some reformation in that quarter . you have opened my eyes , said the italian gravely ; i will show the gentlemen the door . monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter : and who only needs one thing more to make him happy . yes , indeed but one ! said the major with a sigh .: 35.60
<S> alas , murmured he , with intense suffering , i might , then , have been happy yet . then he carried hayde e to her room , resigned her to the care of her attendants , and returning to his study , which he shut quickly this time , he again copied the destroyed will .: 67.75
<S> certainly that is most in accord with your own principles , replied milady , frigidly .: 63.64
<S> calm and resolute , he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel , calculated its probable method of approach ; retreated , if at all , as a point of strategy and not from cowardice ; was quick to see an opening for attack , and won victory at a single thrust .: 145.43
<S> in addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles .: 70.29
<S> possibly this one , who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing , has asked more in the eyes of heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor .: 140.66
<S> from the manner in which you walked and talked together , one would have thought you were two school girls telling your secrets to each other . we were having a confidential conversation , returned valentine ; she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m. de morcerf ; and i , on the other hand , was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m. d e pinay . dear valentine ! that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and euge nie , as in speaking of the man whom i could not love , my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed . ah , how good you are to say so , valentine !: 67.11
<S> the result was , that rospigliosi and spada paid for being cardinals , and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation , and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators .: 98.60
<S> there were , besides , other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining , and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself .: 62.28
<S> i only ate some fruit .: 48.11
<S> first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her , then morrel stretched his arms towards her ; sometimes mere strangers , like the count of monte cristo came to visit her ; even the very furniture , in these moments of delirium , seemed to move , and this state lasted till about three o clock in the morning , when a deep , heavy slumber overcame the young girl , from which she did not awake till daylight .: 49.51
<S> and the duke ? furious against the cardinal .: 37.32
<S> and if i went to seek vampa , would you accompany me ? if my society would not be disagreeable . be it so .: 46.92
<S> he spoke of me to lord de winter , already prejudiced against me , and told him that his sister in law was a prostitute , a branded woman .: 27.48
<S> as to m. de boville , he was in such a state of despair , that it was evident all the faculties of his mind , absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment , did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past .: 30.69
<S> for my part , monsieur , i am catholic my father , faithful to his principles , having made my elder brother a huguenot . and what was the end of this worthy man ? asked d artagnan .: 28.85
<S> how strange , continued the king , with some asperity ; the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say , a murder has been committed , and especially so when they can add , and we are on the track of the guilty persons . sire , your majesty will , i trust , be amply satisfied on this point at least . we shall see .: 48.44
<S> try me , gentlemen , said he , and i swear to you by my honor that i will not go hence if we are conquered . what is your name , my brave fellow ? said athos .: 18.71
<S> bonacieux ; but why , then , did you cry out so ? do you not understand ? said milady , who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind .: 32.54
<S> the soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing , on foot , his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat .: 54.49
<S> shall we see you again to give us any information ? inquired the countess .: 22.41
<S> he hesitated a moment , he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil s punishment .: 42.09
<S> they directed their horses to the city .: 24.27
<S> i suffered , that is all . yes , said mazarin , as women suffer in avenging themselves .: 39.80
<S> upon reaching the room below , i found five or six custom house officers , and two or three gendarmes all heavily armed .: 89.87
<S> in this frame of mind , grateful for the accidental meeting with planchet , pleased with himself , d artagnan reached notre dame .: 86.67
<S> messieurs porthos and aramis , repeated athos , you who are her judges , what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman ? the punishment of death , replied the musketeers , in a hollow voice .: 49.19
<S> i think this is about your position , is it not ? confound it , yes ! replied danglars .: 29.46
<S> who goes there ? cried the same voice , impatiently whilst d artagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses heads .: 55.75
<S> the musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed , and which indeed have survived them , of the procurators of the period meanness , stinginess , fasts ; but as , after all , excepting some few acts of economy which porthos had always found very unseasonable , the procurator s wife had been tolerably liberal that is , be it understood , for a procurator s wife he hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind .: 91.17
<S> nothing .: 50.22
<S> very well ; if ever you meet him again , wherever it may be , whether on the high road or in the street or in a church , anywhere that he or you may be , put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity , without mercy , as you would crush a viper or a scorpion !: 84.38
<S> porthos would have given ten years of his life to possess this sword .: 42.51
<S> it is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher .: 43.54
<S> have you the diamond ? continued athos .: 16.60
<S> napoleon certainly he knew something of , inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him ; but of clement vii .: 55.01
<S> the palace of whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of cromwell , who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually .: 95.40
<S> i will , then , wait until the last moment , and when my misery is certain , irremediable , hopeless , i will write a confidential letter to my brother in law , another to the prefect of police , to acquaint them with my intention , and at the corner of some wood , on the brink of some abyss , on the bank of some river , i will put an end to my existence , as certainly as i am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in france . 30333m valentine trembled convulsively ; she loosened her hold of the gate , her arms fell by her side , and two large tears rolled down her cheeks .: 37.07
<S> porthos looked very melancholy .: 66.09
<S> but andrea drew a cigar case from his pocket , took a havana , quietly lit it , and began smoking .: 70.54
<S> the same silence , and then , ere the host could oppose his design , grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the bolt .: 69.55
<S> and the thing was so much the more annoying , as , according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman , albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him , and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs .: 50.25
<S> i see that i shall not only go alone to the duke of bracciano s , but also return to florence alone . if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful , said albert , i shall fix myself at rome for six weeks , at least .: 50.67
<S> if , then , i should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably , to comment on my actions , or watch my conduct , that very instant you would quit my service .: 74.58
<S> they both listened ; steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the stairs .: 75.77
<S> upon the landing leading to the chamber , and crouching against the door , he found the poor girl , all in a tremble .: 36.68
<S> the englishman calculated fast ; the two harnesses were worth three hundred pistoles .: 48.31
<S> d artagnan remained all day in his quarters , assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad .: 55.33
<S> at eight o clock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before , except that d artagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with monsieur groslow .: 39.87
<S> the breakfast hour arrived , but m. de villefort was not at table .: 34.91
<S> i made such haste that i am certain of not having been forestalled .: 31.72
<S> he was captured again , and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber , in which ornano , puylaurens , and his uncle had died .: 63.32
<S> the mendicant hesitated at first , but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented , and walked on before athos .: 39.37
<S> danglars defended himself with the baseness , but at the same time with the assurance , of a man who speaks the truth , at least in part , if not wholly not for conscience sake , but through fear .: 55.74
<S> in the meantime , my dear lucien , here are cigars contraband , of course try them , and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves . peste ! i will do nothing of the kind ; the moment they come from government you would find them execrable .: 77.44
<S> the will was made the day before yesterday , i believe ; you see there has been no time lost . oh , mercy , m. d avrigny ! no mercy , sir !: 32.22
<S> nobody knows him .: 51.75
<S> devil take him ! then he said aloud : the queen , my lord ?: 18.37
<S> the mountaineers are bonapartists , sire . then , murmured louis , he was well informed .: 73.61
<S> at first they appeared like black specks , and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves .: 55.96
<S> come in , come in , said albert , rising and advancing to meet the young man .: 16.28
<S> possessed by one single thought that of the promise he had made , and of the responsibility he had taken he retired last to his chamber , begged the host to procure him a map of the province , bent over it , examined every line traced upon it , perceived that there were four different roads from be thune to armentie res , and summoned the lackeys .: 50.05
<S> jump directly down , close to monsieur de la fere , or , on the honor of a gentleman , i ll kill you ! monsieur , monsieur , cried mazarin , you are breaking your word to me ! i did i promise you anything , my lord ? mazarin groaned .: 25.33
<S> the inspector turned smilingly to the governor .: 27.86
<S> you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me , are you not ? said the count .: 16.29
<S> you are free , my brothers !: 19.20
<S> where must we place him ? demanded the chief .: 31.29
<S> no , no , my dear edmond my boy my son ! no ; but i did not expect you ; and joy , the surprise of seeing you so suddenly ah , i feel as if i were going to die . come , come , cheer up , my dear father !: 34.61
<S> the woman who was here the woman with the embroidered handkerchief . who told you there was a woman here ? replied aramis , becoming as pale as death .: 44.01
<S> i have , therefore , chosen this drawing room , where you see , smiling and happy in their magnificent frames , your portrait , mine , my mother s , and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals .: 63.74
<S> and now , good night ; go to your rooms , and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening .: 52.67
<S> do you think anything else was to be expected of them ? asked comminges , who , putting together what mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the comte de la fere had said , began to feel a degree of uneasiness .: 40.53
<S> the iron box was there no one had touched it under a beautiful fig tree my father had planted the day i was born , which overshadowed the spot .: 83.26
<S> coquenard , they arose slowly from the table , folded their napkins more slowly still , bowed , and retired .: 106.02
<S> a child ! he exclaimed .: 13.08
<S> but the skilful manner in which dante s had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him ; and then , when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the cha teau d if , and heard the distant report , he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going , like that of kings , was accompanied with salutes of artillery .: 60.74
<S> yes , you will receive it from your father personally , but lord wilmore will be the security for the money .: 41.33
<S> i shall serve under the eye of your eminence , and if i have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention , then i shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor me .: 49.12
<S> it rests between his conscience and his god . but if your honor knew this man ? i neither know nor wish to know him .: 57.51
<S> a moment later the gray headed man was beside him .: 59.52
<S> but i forgot , added the gascon , smiling , pardon , i forgot you are no longer athos ; but never mind , let us hear your plan for dinner , porthos . my plan ! yes , have you a plan ? no !: 36.91
<S> see , he exclaimed , there remains still some of the magic draught .: 61.32
<S> her friendship was a fatal sign which called down persecution .: 201.38
<S> but it seems that it is intended to affect me personally .: 30.07
<S> at thirty five , which was then his age , he passed , with just title , for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of france or england .: 84.19
<S> can i have lost it ?: 29.64
<S> the mercer had said that he was rich ; the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as m. bonacieux ; and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love , which had been the consequence of it .: 54.44
<S> make your mind easy , resumed athos , we are all faithful servants of his majesty . is what you tell me true ? asked the wounded man .: 26.01
<S> however , he continued all the same , but with increasing warmth : yes , i can very well understand that after having inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir likewise ; but know beforehand , if you kill me or cause me to be killed , my precautions are taken .: 49.14
<S> he therefore found d artagnan alone , and as it was nearly eight o clock he took the young man with him .: 19.74
<S> albert is ten minutes after time . there he comes , said beauchamp , on horseback , at full gallop , followed by a servant . how imprudent , said cha teau renaud , to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols , after all the instructions i had given him . and besides , said beauchamp , with a collar above his cravat , an open coat and white waistcoat !: 42.31
<S> to learn more about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and how your efforts and donations can help , see sections 3 and 4 and the foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org .: 29.23
<S> no , my lord ; be assured we shall not . d artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation .: 20.80
<S> you were walking one day behind the chartreux , when it would have been better if you had been elsewhere .: 51.72
<S> my word , said de winter , rising , i think the hussy is going mad !: 26.06
<S> a horse for planchet , that s all .: 27.61
<S> d artagnan , remember this !: 25.99
<S> she did well to die , poor girl ! the sitting is adjourned , gentlemen , said the president ; fresh inquiries will be made , and the case will be tried next session by another magistrate . as for andrea , who was calm and more interesting than ever , he left the hall , escorted by gendarmes , who involuntarily paid him some attention .: 56.25
<S> in fact , about four o clock they were all concentrated about the palais royal , the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and swiss guards , and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance .: 54.97
<S> start , start ! said d artagnan .: 14.25
<S> i ask your excellencies pardon , but this is quite a french demand ; for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button . then i must give up the idea ? no ; we have them ready made .: 77.13
<S> you may guess , finding the luck turned , that i again staked the diamond . the devil ! said d artagnan , becoming angry again .: 57.39
<S> oh , no , sir , said madame danglars ; but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality . 30223m ah , yes , said monte cristo smiling ; it is all a matter of imagination .: 31.71
<S> well , this surprises me , for i thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs ! 30243m i ?: 97.25
<S> athos went in quest of the englishman , whom he found in the stable , examining the harnesses with a greedy eye .: 37.90
<S> he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hinges the clock gave its warning to strike eleven the door of his study opened .: 80.91
<S> franz complimented albert , who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction .: 37.83
<S> do not charge a fee for access to , viewing , displaying , performing , copying or distributing any project gutenberg works unless you comply with paragraph 1.e.8 or 1.e.9 .: 7.78
<S> then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him . what , did you refuse to dine with him ? said old dante s ; and did he invite you to dine ? yes , my dear father , replied edmond , smiling at his father s astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son .: 27.82
<S> i give you a hundred , i give you a thousand times to guess , monsieur , the visit i received in your absence . when ? about half an hour ago , while you were at monsieur de tre ville s. who has been here ?: 34.62
<S> d artagnan relates that on his first visit to m. de tre ville , captain of the king s musketeers , he met in the antechamber three young men , serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received , bearing the names of athos , porthos , and aramis .: 28.75
<S> his only jewellery was a chain , so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat .: 67.54
<S> what a misfortune ! he had been informed at seven o clock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle ; he had hastened to milady s chamber , had found it empty , the window open , and the bars filed , had remembered the verbal caution d artagnan had transmitted to him by his messenger , had trembled for the duke , and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled , had jumped upon the first he found , had galloped off like the wind , had alighted below in the courtyard , had ascended the stairs precipitately , and on the top step , as we have said , had encountered felton .: 54.58
<S> athos and aramis walked down toward the port .: 17.37
<S> he was still sleeping , his head gracefully reposing on his arm .: 29.99
<S> in fact , d artagnan believed that he might be tranquil , as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests .: 20.76
<S> then turning to the baroness : may i ask how mademoiselle danglars is ? said he .: 35.92
<S> well , i will amuse you . how ? by introducing to you a new acquaintance . a man or a woman ? a man . i know so many men already . but you do not know this man . where does he come from the end of the world ? farther still , perhaps . the deuce !: 33.96
<S> but this annoys you ; let us change the subject .: 33.61
<S> he had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws after the example of his clerks .: 50.48
<S> villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you , and , perhaps , to others .: 55.75
<S> the king threw himself into an arm chair .: 25.06
<S> arrived at the end of the lane , d artagnan turned to the left .: 12.70
<S> it concerns me much , said d artagnan , since you can not marry madame without my consent and since and since ? asked the swiss .: 48.59
<S> on the day after the morrow , by eleven o clock , the two diamond studs were finished , and they were so completely imitated , so perfectly alike , that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones , and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was .: 51.56
<S> the principal charge against you is this letter , and you see villefort approached the fire , cast it in , and waited until it was entirely consumed .: 93.79
<S> one day it was the morning of the day my story begins the king , louis xiv. , then ten years of age , went in state , under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox , to notre dame .: 61.60
<S> you will not sign that order , my lord ! said felton , making a step toward the duke .: 18.57
<S> my credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de wardes . and will you go ? asked kitty .: 31.84
<S> well , it is a question of serving the king , the gentleman s duty . but the king is with mazarin . he is , but not willingly ; in appearance , not heart ; and that is exactly the snare the king s enemies are preparing for the poor child . ah !: 45.43
<S> the pharaon ! said every voice .: 35.87
<S> milady uttered a cry of joy ; this man was the comte de rochefort the demoniacal tool of his eminence .: 19.59
<S> he recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him , and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand , he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabbard .: 44.85
<S> i am at your service , sir , said the abbe , with a marked italian accent .: 9.08
<S> you are a man of taste .: 14.32
<S> we must cut off our hair , that the populace may not insult us .: 59.84
<S> bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen , concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress , and disappeared with the lightness of a bird .: 23.45
<S> prince cavalcanti , said the latter ; prince cavalcanti , where are you ? andrea , andrea , repeated several young people , who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his christian name .: 39.69
<S> wait till he is set out and then , marry , come up , ask , and find out .: 53.46
<S> onward ! cried the gascon .: 14.52
<S> what is to be done ? my god , my god ! murmured the young woman , ought i to confide such a secret to you , monsieur ?: 24.93
<S> yet , i am sure , she is not happy , said caderousse .: 19.66
<S> was he to be thus stopped at the beginning , and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task ?: 94.86
<S> information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation project gutenberg depends upon and can not survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment .: 31.24
<S> president , i can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the lieutenant general the count of morcerf in epirus and in macedonia with important particulars . the president paused , and the count turned pale .: 44.25
<S> grimaud placed the pie before the duke , who took a knife with a silver blade to raise the upper crust ; but la ramee , who was afraid of any harm happening to this fine work of art , passed his knife , which had an iron blade , to the duke .: 50.76
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> and you believe he died of hunger , sir , of hunger , said caderousse .: 20.98
<S> my god , have mercy upon me ! and , uttering a fearful cry , barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning .: 30.97
<S> he was , we repeat , handsome , young , and bold ; he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in return .: 42.55
<S> i obeyed my love ; and have i not been richly paid for that obedience ?: 56.02
<S> madame de motteville , who was on especial duty that evening , followed to aid and undress her .: 81.62
<S> ah , you are his son ! he said ; that is a different thing . sir , i surrender , said louvieres , presenting his unloaded musket to the officer .: 31.66
<S> he began to reflect upon the events that had passed ; they were numerous and inauspicious .: 35.59
<S> bonacieux entered .: 27.83
<S> of what , think you , do young and strong men die in prison , when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year , unless it be of imprisonment ? caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow .: 62.00
<S> yes ; i will accompany you . but did you not read that i must be alone ? said julie .: 18.28
<S> i will send for m. deschamps ; we will read and sign the contract before we separate , and this evening madame de villefort shall accompany valentine to her estate , where we will rejoin them in a week . sir , said franz , i have one request to make . what is it ? i wish albert de morcerf and raoul de cha teau renaud to be present at this signature ; you know they are my witnesses . half an hour will suffice to apprise them ; will you go for them yourself , or shall you send ? i prefer going , sir . i shall expect you , then , in half an hour , baron , and valentine will be ready . franz bowed and left the room .: 33.45
<S> there is good and holy action to be performed , monsieur , and much money to be gained at the same time . mme .: 48.30
<S> at last , one day , emmanuel came to his wife , who had just finished making up the accounts .: 26.98
<S> danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips .: 68.52
<S> this communication , continued the procureur , in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion , will , we are sure , meet with your approbation . the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind ; he listened , nothing more .: 69.17
<S> this disposition , visible as it was in his majesty , did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway .: 72.89
<S> strange child , murmured the baroness .: 34.60
<S> pardieu ! mute as a carp . well , i think andrea stopped and looked around .: 62.62
<S> i will repeat them , then ; and since he has chosen me as his interpreter , i will be faithful to the trust , and will not alter a word of his intentions . oh , i am listening with the greatest impatience , replied the young man ; speak , i beg of you . valentine cast down her eyes ; this was a good omen for morrel , for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming valentine .: 31.06
<S> it means , replied mazarin , trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt , that our parts are changed , and that instead of these gentlemen being my prisoners i am theirs ; but , gentlemen , i warn you , unless you kill me , your victory will be of very short duration ; people will come to the rescue . ah !: 52.53
<S> his father went up to him , took him in his arms , and kissed his forehead .: 12.07
<S> m. coquenard was served first , then porthos .: 93.14
<S> but since the end of the month m. morrel had passed many an anxious hour .: 40.02
<S> you would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald green sea ; you would like very well , either on land or on the ocean , to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning .: 85.68
<S> i was born in no .: 28.65
<S> franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity .: 57.73
<S> i have always been an honest man , and , as far as lay in my power , i have done good . i do not deny it , returned the count ; but why are you thus agitated .: 24.91
<S> the brand disappeared ; the beauty alone remained .: 108.23
<S> speak ! morcerf did not reply .: 29.60
<S> midnight sounded , and almost at the same time the bell was rung in milady s chamber .: 28.68
<S> you know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles , at your choice . yes . well , then , i repeat , you are wrong .: 28.12
<S> albert soon left her , ordered his horses , and having arranged his toilet , drove to the champs e lyse es , to the house of monte cristo .: 28.65
<S> but now it is different ; i have lost all that bound me to life , death smiles and invites me to repose ; i die after my own manner , i die exhausted and broken spirited , as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand times round my cell , that is thirty thousand steps , or about ten leagues . no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed , arranged his couch to the best of his power , ate little and slept less , and found existence almost supportable , because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure , like a worn out garment .: 103.57
<S> look around you , gentlemen , if you doubt the fact , said the duke .: 18.77
<S> do these belong to the cardinal ?: 25.02
<S> u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff .: 93.72
<S> gaetano was not mistaken .: 27.53
<S> go , said he quickly .: 16.14
<S> they had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by monsieur d arminges .: 44.63
<S> oh , as to that , i do not engage myself .: 17.45
<S> now lift me on my bed , for i can no longer support myself . edmond took the old man in his arms , and laid him on the bed .: 22.04
<S> the accusation chapter 81 .: 31.17
<S> beware !: 43.76
<S> why , what can have happened ? he exclaimed , what has thus disturbed you ?: 33.05
<S> at the sixth cabaret , then , as we said , d artagnan stopped , asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality , and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room , determined thus to wait till daylight ; but this time again his hopes were disappointed , and although he listened with all his ears , he heard nothing , amid the oaths , coarse jokes , and abuse which passed between the laborers , servants , and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part , which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him .: 51.58
<S> the men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths , leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers ; for on approaching nearer , instead of one extended figure , the young men discovered two .: 87.42
<S> they entered ; behind a glass window , by the light of the cardinal s lantern , which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery , they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the castle of rueil , in long lines , forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys .: 51.73
<S> however , to teresa s great astonishment , luigi remained mute , and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening .: 36.06
<S> this lady , said the count , speaking to ali in the arabic language , is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives ; but the boy refuses , saying you are too ugly . ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy , on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion ; but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of monte cristo that the arab had been wounded to the heart .: 68.30
<S> did you not yet know me ?: 24.98
<S> d artagnan took up his camp tin cup , filled it with wine and arose .: 43.51
<S> athos and aramis were more and more astonished .: 17.77
<S> madame , say that you would love me then !: 38.56
<S> near the barrels stood selim , my father s favorite , whom i mentioned to you just now .: 51.50
<S> i have just received my courier from greece , said danglars .: 35.37
<S> general , said the president , we acknowledge no king louis xviii. , or an ex emperor , but his majesty the emperor and king , driven from france , which is his kingdom , by violence and treason . excuse me , gentlemen , said the general ; you may not acknowledge louis xviii. , but i do , as he has made me a baron and a field marshal , and i shall never forget that for these two titles i am indebted to his happy return to france . sir , said the president , rising with gravity , be careful what you say ; your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the island of elba , and have deceived us !: 58.45
<S> at sight of this pale , bleeding man , the wife grasped her husband s arm .: 37.15
<S> ah , ah , said the chief , i now understand why carlini stayed behind . all savage natures appreciate a desperate deed .: 103.04
<S> d artagnan , going to a distance to discover aramis .: 17.54
<S> well , said mme .: 10.41
<S> a sacerdotal officer .: 99.10
<S> morrel pulled the bell , but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered .: 91.76
<S> a quarter of an hour later he was at greenwich .: 10.43
<S> this time it was mordaunt who smiled .: 29.00
<S> i love you also , you ! said she , taking his hand .: 16.98
<S> to purchase back my liberty ? said the cardinal .: 48.27
<S> the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival , and , turning to him , he said hastily : do you know the woman who has just entered that box ? yes ; what do you think of her ? oh , she is perfectly lovely what a complexion !: 43.20
<S> it was a chaise drawn by three horses , driven by a postillion ; rochefort s lackey would precede it , as courier .: 86.07
<S> in the struggle her clothes caught fire , and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate .: 74.02
<S> if you wish it . i am at your service , my lord . i protest , my dear la ramee , said the duke , that you are a charming fellow and that i would stay forever at vincennes to have the pleasure of your society . my lord , replied la ramee , i think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be fulfilled . what do you mean ?: 20.37
<S> i have been heaven s substitute to recompense the good now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked ! at these words he gave a signal , and , as if only awaiting this signal , the yacht instantly put out to sea .: 67.48
<S> he had , then , in order not to disturb his habits , accustomed grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips .: 50.52
<S> milady therefore continued her voyage , and on the very day that planchet embarked at portsmouth for france , the messenger of his eminence entered the port in triumph .: 76.24
<S> i rely much on external impressions ; perhaps , with regard to you , they are immaterial , but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies . very well , replied m. danglars , who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness , but without understanding a word , since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past , he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker .: 56.79
<S> you are in prison , then ? rochefort trembled in every limb at this question .: 36.97
<S> i can not account for it , but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars . 30107m ah , said the count , in a somewhat forced tone , that may be easily explained ; the comtesse de morcerf , who is aristocracy and refinement itself , does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth ; that is natural enough . i do not know if that is her reason , said albert , but one thing i do know , that if this marriage be consummated , it will render her quite miserable .: 53.27
<S> approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away . no , certainly , replied planchet , rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him .: 54.56
<S> i have what is still better .: 77.50
<S> and therefore , when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king , appointed for the next day , gondy alone , in the midst of the general happiness , was dissatisfied ; he sent for the two men whom he was wont to summon when in especially bad humor .: 54.59
<S> i was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them .: 77.20
<S> you love me , my beautiful queen , and you will weep for me ? oh , my god , my god ! cried anne of austria , this is more than i can bear .: 14.52
<S> in france , my dear sir , half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to toulon for five years , for change of air . will you be good enough to explain your meaning ? said the major , endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty .: 49.48
<S> i am going away the day after tomorrow . do what you please , monsieur chevalier .: 22.88
<S> at the voice of this last speaker , grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow .: 65.61
<S> this athos was connected with three young musketeers , named porthos , d artagnan , and he stopped short .: 37.76
<S> the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot .: 51.93
<S> an error i readily forgive , but wilful negligence or forgetfulness , never .: 161.50
<S> a flurry in stocks chapter 55 .: 112.44
<S> before leaving the convent of the carmelites , henrietta had desired her daughter to attend her at the palace , which she had inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chambers .: 57.84
<S> we have circumvented cromwell , mordaunt , and the sea , but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing mazarin . you forget , replied athos , that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into . truly , athos , interrupted d artagnan , i am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of .: 79.91
<S> alas , continued the stranger , doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerf s brow , we do not act thus in italy ; we grow according to our race and our species , and we pursue the same lines , and often the same uselessness , all our lives . but , monsieur , said the count of morcerf , for a man of your merit , italy is not a country , and france opens her arms to receive you ; respond to her call .: 66.37
<S> to the judge to the judge , madame ! it was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman , the anguish of her look , the trembling of her whole frame .: 47.92
<S> stay where you are ; i will go myself . and with a light step , an eye on the watch , observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground , d artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier .: 41.65
<S> i will take charge of the inside one .: 22.66
<S> they set out , passing over the pont neuf ; they pursued their way along the quay then called l abreuvoir pepin , and went along by the walls of the grand chatelet .: 58.59
<S> ah , my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers . well , no , madame , this is the terrible news i have to tell you , said villefort in a hollow voice no , nothing was found beneath the flowers ; there was no child disinterred no .: 66.80
<S> a few dingy olives and stunted fig trees struggled hard for existence , but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict .: 219.73
<S> well , i shall look upon it as an expiation . ah ! said d artagnan ; i know what you mean . and i , too , added aramis ; but you must not think of that , athos ; what is past , is past . i don t understand , said porthos .: 19.76
<S> i have seen milady . where ? demanded d artagnan .: 19.41
<S> we must confess these three strange names struck us ; and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms , under which d artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious , or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which , from caprice , discontent , or want of fortune , they had donned the simple musketeer s uniform .: 93.34
<S> that s all plain enough .: 39.35
<S> lucullus dines with lucullus . porthos looked at the bottle , which was near him , and hoped that with wine , bread , and cheese , he might make a dinner ; but wine was wanting , the bottle was empty .: 52.88
<S> and i was ready to strangle you ! cried the duke .: 19.37
<S> oh , you may even see her if you like , my dear mr. o reilly .: 51.95
<S> holloa ! said he , what does that mean ? if monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me , in the first place , what crimes are imputed to me , i will then tell him the deeds i have really done . crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours , monsieur , said the cardinal .: 46.61
<S> m. de tre ville , moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage , sprang toward him .: 23.45
<S> d artagnan thought of all these matters .: 18.66
<S> thank you , la ramee , said the prisoner .: 12.18
<S> charles was impatiently awaiting his return .: 55.00
<S> come on , come on ! said d artagnan ; let us keep that paper carefully , perhaps i have not thrown away my half pistole .: 34.79
<S> i answered , in greece . then , said he , write to yanina . and who thus advised you ? no other than your friend , monte cristo . the count of monte cristo told you to write to yanina ? yes ; and i wrote , and will show you my correspondence , if you like . albert and beauchamp looked at each other .: 35.84
<S> oh , said the count , i only know two things which destroy the appetite , grief and as i am happy to see you very cheerful , it is not that and love .: 45.44
<S> dante s himself was simply , but becomingly , clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb ; and with his fine countenance , radiant with joy and happiness , a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined .: 92.00
<S> she had laid that down the preceding evening .: 67.39
<S> meanwhile , grimaud , still mute as ever , drew from the pie the other poniard , the rope ladder and the gag .: 66.85
<S> then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor .: 159.31
<S> count , said he , i thank you for your hospitality , which i would gladly have enjoyed longer ; but i must return to paris . what has happened ? a great misfortune , more important to me than life .: 30.08
<S> the bourbons left him quietly enough at the catalans , but napoleon returned , a special levy was made , and fernand was compelled to join .: 83.13
<S> why , this count of monte cristo must be a nabob ? indeed i do not know what he is ; he has three unlimited credits one on me , one on rothschild , one on lafitte ; and , you see , he added carelessly , he has given me the preference , by leaving a balance of 100,000 francs . m. de boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration .: 53.29
<S> no one better . speak out then , say what it was ! gaspard ! cried la carconte , do as you will ; you are master but if you take my advice you ll hold your tongue . well , wife , replied caderousse , i don t know but what you re right ! so you will say nothing ? asked the abbe .: 46.78
<S> are you not married ? asked the countess .: 9.01
<S> i believe he s swimming toward us .: 73.41
<S> your wit is always leading you beyond bounds ; if monsieur de tre ville heard you , you would repent of speaking thus . are you going to give me a lesson , porthos ? cried aramis , from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning .: 64.31
<S> i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m. de villefort . the procureur arose , delighted with the proposition , but his wife slightly changed color .: 38.88
<S> and smack of the puritan to a frightful extent , said aramis .: 59.62
<S> have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime ? villefort tried to smile .: 45.97
<S> you see we were quite right to pacify that country . yes ; but don carlos ? well , don carlos will drink bordeaux , and in ten years we will marry his son to the little queen . you will then obtain the golden fleece , if you are still in the ministry . i think , albert , you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning . well , you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach ; but i hear beauchamp in the next room ; you can dispute together , and that will pass away the time . about what ? about the papers . my dear friend , said lucien with an air of sovereign contempt , do i ever read the papers ? then you will dispute the more . m .: 43.73
<S> the figure put the comb in its pocket .: 42.64
<S> at the end of the dinner he entered in person .: 15.46
<S> but , now that the duke had escaped , the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock .: 51.69
<S> and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret ?: 360.44
<S> it was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short summer ; the clouds which m. de villefort had perceived at sunrise had all disappeared as if by magic , and one of the softest and most brilliant days of september shone forth in all its splendor .: 65.43
<S> monsieur your friend pardon for not calling him by the honorable name which no doubt he bears , but we do not know that name , monsieur your friend , having disabled two men with his pistols , retreated fighting with his sword , with which he disabled one of my men , and stunned me with a blow of the flat side of it . you villain , will you finish ? cried d artagnan , athos what has become of athos ? while fighting and retreating , as i have told monseigneur , he found the door of the cellar stairs behind him , and as the door was open , he took out the key , and barricaded himself inside .: 50.74
<S> monsieur mousqueton !: 36.26
<S> they arrived at the appointed spot .: 19.44
<S> never ; that ring is defiled , d artagnan . sell it , then . sell a jewel which came from my mother !: 60.05
<S> oh , my god , my god !: 4.70
<S> i will , however , inform monsieur d artagnan of your arrival here . comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion , at the end of the orangery .: 29.95
<S> on your knees , count . athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual , raised his sword , and instead of pronouncing the customary formula , i make you a knight .: 72.76
<S> her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age .: 49.74
<S> i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron ; but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them , i ventured to send them back to her , with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands . you are , then , doubtless , the count of monte cristo , of whom hermine has talked to me so much ? you have rightly guessed , madame , replied the count .: 41.14
<S> is , then , all that i have heard really true ? she inquired .: 41.38
<S> unhappy man , cried he , wringing his hands in his turn ; you love valentine , that daughter of an accursed race ! never had morrel witnessed such an expression never had so terrible an eye flashed before his face never had the genius of terror he had so often seen , either on the battle field or in the murderous nights of algeria , shaken around him more dreadful fire .: 90.75
<S> on ! cried d artagnan ; all goes well !: 31.03
<S> did the romans eat them ? said the gardener ate dormice ? i have read so in petronius , said the count .: 89.68
<S> be calm , exclaimed athos , for heaven s sake !: 24.04
<S> do you know what those three windows were worth ? two or three hundred roman crowns ? two or three thousand . the deuce ! does his island produce him such a revenue ? it does not bring him a bajocco . then why did he purchase it ? for a whim . he is an original , then ? in reality , observed albert , he seemed to me somewhat eccentric ; were he at paris , and a frequenter of the theatres , i should say he was a poor devil literally mad .: 50.83
<S> you know the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order , and her will bequeaths to valentine the entire property of the saint me ran family ; the notary showed me the documents yesterday , which will enable us to draw up the contract immediately .: 67.41
<S> the man , hearing nothing more , stood erect , and while monte cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire , whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale .: 82.07
<S> some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two .: 50.59
<S> describe to me your abduction , i pray you . oh , that s of no consequence just now , said mme .: 33.99
<S> this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution .: 100.16
<S> making no reply , grimaud opened the poor man s jacket to feel if the heart beat , whilst the host approached in his turn ; but in a moment they both fell back , the host uttering a cry of horror and grimaud becoming pallid .: 64.61
<S> a shorter clerk came behind the first , a taller clerk behind the second , a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third .: 86.30
<S> then my dear monsieur bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant ? so far from it , madame , he was too proud of your prudence , and above all , of your love . a second smile , almost imperceptible , stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman .: 54.28
<S> with such a vade mecum d artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes , to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait .: 156.25
<S> speak to him yourself , for ever since you were deputed by me to arrest the duc de beaufort , this officer and i have been on bad terms .: 46.26
<S> m. d avrigny smiled sadly .: 20.12
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> you see my strength fails me ; you see plainly i can not walk .: 41.36
<S> when i see you merely , you look like a reasonable being ; when you speak , i seem to have to do with a madman .: 43.32
<S> you remember , said the count , during the most profound silence , that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house ; the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice , on attempting to leave it . yes , said danglars .: 31.70
<S> there he is ! somebody has disturbed him , without doubt , said d artagnan .: 26.18
<S> this confession , said she , growing paler , what is this confession ? you gave de wardes a meeting on thursday last in this very room , did you not ? no , no !: 55.52
<S> you are young and rich leave paris all is soon forgotten in this great babylon of excitement and changing tastes .: 186.38
<S> lord wilmore , having heard the door close after him , returned to his bedroom , where with one hand he pulled off his light hair , his red whiskers , his false jaw , and his wound , to resume the black hair , dark complexion , and pearly teeth of the count of monte cristo .: 38.97
<S> the devil ! exclaimed porthos ; there s vulcan foundered . zounds ! cried d artagnan , then we must stop !: 28.74
<S> in two hours time , said he , these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each , to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more ; then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs , and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs .: 86.28
<S> in 2001 , the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg and future generations .: 12.46
<S> i am getting more and more seasick . go in , then , grimaud , said mousqueton , handing him the beer pot and gimlet .: 51.52
<S> forward ! aramis , wounded as he was , seized the mane of his horse , which carried him on with the others .: 38.92
<S> we ought not , therefore , i think , to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier condition .: 64.32
<S> if we stay here five minutes more there s an end of us . yes , you are right . but where shall we go ? asked porthos .: 24.33
<S> the first person to attract the attention of dante s , as he landed on the canebie re , was one of the crew belonging to the pharaon .: 26.68
<S> return on sunday . on the sunday following i did return to him .: 79.40
<S> then the curate forbade me to quit my uniform , and the jesuit entreated me to get him made a musketeer . without a thesis ? cried d artagnan , without a thesis ?: 51.85
<S> now , do you know , baron , i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it ; as if all the world did not know who the countess g was . ah , to be sure , replied cha teau renaud ; the lovely venetian , is it not ? herself . at this moment the countess perceived albert , and returned his salutation with a smile .: 31.96
<S> from time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder , and he panted like a horse .: 55.85
<S> they are destined to produce at least ten .: 57.77
<S> well , he is a man of bad taste , and is still more enchanted with another .: 31.85
<S> d artagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light , but could not find planchet in any of them .: 40.98
<S> the jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs .: 65.33
<S> oh , if you refuse my advice what do you advise ? said valentine , raising her eyes to heaven and sighing .: 22.77
<S> you will excuse us , sir , but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it . go , my young sirs , said the sick man , and may you both be blessed for your piety .: 40.27
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder , crying , help ! a second blow struck him almost immediately in the side , and he fell , calling , help , murder ! then , as he rolled on the ground , his adversary seized him by the hair , and struck him a third blow in the chest .: 50.32
<S> athos , whose keen eye lost nothing , perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young gascon as he replied , we had a short discussion upon dress . and you , aramis ? asked athos .: 58.27
<S> everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face , whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb , and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror .: 97.25
<S> for an instant , without an exclamation , without a cry for help , athos tried to sustain himself on the surface of the waters , but the weight dragged him down ; he disappeared by degrees ; soon nothing was to be seen except his long , floating hair ; then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water , which , in its turn , was soon effaced , alone indicated the spot where these two had sunk .: 53.36
<S> i forgot and he gave some orders in a low voice to one of the horsemen .: 30.38
<S> not for the countess , or for albert , said monte cristo ; a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored one , blood washes out shame . poor countess , said maximilian , i pity her very much ; she is so noble a woman ! pity albert also , maximilian ; for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess .: 66.92
<S> milady asked some questions about the carriage .: 47.09
<S> as to porthos , that is certainly droll ; but i am not the less a giddy fool .: 39.25
<S> with my usual fatuity i doubted it ; now i am convinced .: 70.07
<S> madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring , intending to direct her waiting maid to the spot where she would find valentine , when the young lady herself entered the apartment .: 28.66
<S> upon my word , cried the old man , you make short work of this kind of affair .: 23.22
<S> you knew i should be killed on leaving this house , and did not warn me ! 40168m no ; for i saw god s justice placed in the hands of benedetto , and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence . god s justice !: 49.13
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> let us rather kill them !: 45.60
<S> supper was to be served at three , and the clock of st. jean had struck three quarters past two .: 49.70
<S> my poor mother ! said villefort , to have such duties to perform at your age after such a blow ! god has supported me through all ; and then , my dear marquis , he would certainly have done everything for me that i performed for him .: 60.88
<S> remember that the queen awaits you , and after the queen , the cardinal , and after the cardinal , myself . d artagnan summoned anne of austria s servant and signified that he was ready to follow him into the queen s presence .: 26.08
<S> where am i , and why am i here ?: 29.19
<S> what fine things we would do together ! yes , said porthos .: 47.29
<S> albert looked around him .: 15.58
<S> now , i am going to put a question to you , and one very much to the purpose too .: 38.06
<S> to my misfortune , to my eternal misfortune ! and milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief .: 56.64
<S> gentlemen , he said , addressing the two musketeers , accompany the royal carriage , we are going forward to look for lodgings . d artagnan started off for saint germain , followed by porthos .: 28.89
<S> difficult for kings to return to the capitals of their kingdoms .: 32.21
<S> it often happens , continued she , that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole life .: 61.74
<S> in rome , as everywhere else , the arrival of a post chaise is an event .: 80.13
<S> the lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait , keeping together and without dismounting , at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was lodged .: 45.33
<S> i am only a lieutenant of musketeers , very poor , and journeys cost money .: 53.15
<S> ay , but it is for the first time , madame ! i did not say france , my lord ; i said the cardinal , and the cardinal is not even a frenchman . but did you see the queen ? it is useless , replied henrietta , the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says no .: 29.36
<S> yes , i understand , grandfather , said the young girl .: 12.95
<S> i reached the lower door .: 25.80
<S> well , it is just for that reason that we have called you , my good m. mouston .: 32.78
<S> you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project , but today you see it was a reality , and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word . i will keep it , returned morcerf ; but i fear that you will be much disappointed , accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons .: 72.04
<S> he went with groslow to the captain s berth , a sort of temporary cabin of planks , for the chief apartment had been given up by captain rogers to the passengers , who were to be accommodated at the other end of the boat .: 49.83
<S> here , it is eleven o clock .: 12.39
<S> at last he heard the voice of la ramee .: 12.82
<S> i am lord de winter , brother in law of that woman . the three friends uttered a cry of surprise .: 12.54
<S> believe me , that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you ; and had she crossed your path , and you had crushed her like glass , still , edmond , still she must have admired you !: 76.15
<S> she made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object .: 134.65
<S> but remember , also , that if by your fault any evil happens to d artagnan , i will find you , wherever you may be , for the purpose of ripping up your belly . oh , monsieur ! said planchet , humiliated by the suspicion , and moreover , terrified at the calm air of the musketeer .: 42.78
<S> well , fernand , i must say , said caderousse , beginning the conversation , with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy , you look uncommonly like a rejected lover ; and he burst into a hoarse laugh .: 66.10
<S> these horses are equipped for the field .: 36.78
<S> counting his treasures , replied the governor .: 52.34
<S> he had fainted .: 26.47
<S> a young man does not require luxuries ; besides , i know what travelling is . with a post chaise and valet de chambre ? any way , mother . well , be it so .: 51.22
<S> a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind .: 25.93
<S> then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him ; and one day after dinner he went to bed , calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that mazarin had poisoned him .: 50.95
<S> leave me at the first port you make ; i shall be sure to find employment . do you know the mediterranean ? i have sailed over it since my childhood . you know the best harbors ? there are few ports that i could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes . i say , captain , said the sailor who had cried courage ! to dante s , if what he says is true , what hinders his staying with us ? if he says true , said the captain doubtingly .: 70.17
<S> shall we wait , or shall we charge ? let us charge them , answered the gascon .: 27.59
<S> nevertheless , d artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed him .: 26.60
<S> the three carbineers looked about carefully on every side , saw the young peasants , and galloping up , began to question them .: 53.82
<S> are you french , sir ? said he to athos .: 13.74
<S> that s the thing ! replied the gascon .: 12.90
<S> some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now , that of living again in their grandchildren .: 79.24
<S> at nine in the morning he reached nanteuil and stopped for breakfast .: 44.00
<S> what do you want ? asked he , with a more sorrowful than angry tone .: 15.12
<S> oh , you do not mean that , said he ; besides , here comes the confirmation of my assertion . baptistin entered , and remained standing at the door .: 20.36
<S> he who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there ; behold ! de winter turned and followed the direction of aramis s finger .: 74.86
<S> yes !: 18.78
<S> good , she exclaimed , approaching the table , she has taken part of her draught ; the glass is three quarters empty . then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire , and although she had just left her bed , she could not resist the temptation offered by valentine s sleep , so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest .: 45.38
<S> if you do not go , sir , said de guiche , remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized wherever you may be ; and then i swear your trial will be summary ; one can always find a tree and a cord . the monk s eye again flashed , but that was all ; he merely repeated his phrase , i will go , and he went .: 56.02
<S> was going when he was assassinated . every one thronged around mademoiselle paulet , for she was always very much the fashion .: 94.89
<S> de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence .: 70.31
<S> my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you , never to do anything against you ; on your side , a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me .: 63.55
<S> an old gentleman , continued the concierge , a staunch follower of the bourbons ; he had an only daughter , who married m. de villefort , who had been the king s attorney at ni mes , and afterwards at versailles . monte cristo glanced at bertuccio , who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling .: 35.47
<S> no less , said athos , as pale as a corpse .: 15.12
<S> morbleu ! cried the latter , i should say that i do pledge myself to it !: 31.61
<S> when i ask you if you are consoled , i speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets .: 38.12
<S> gondy sprang to the window and threw it open ; he recognized louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men .: 34.40
<S> well , said the coadjutor , on seeing him , you are in disgrace , then , abbe ? this was the orthodox phrase .: 31.46
<S> the swiss , with an air of stupefaction , looked at the hostess , who turned pale .: 17.93
<S> where does he live ? rue fe rou , two steps from here . let us go ! both resumed their way .: 48.63
<S> the return , also , of the conqueror of lens was the pretext for giving a grand banquet .: 64.37
<S> but parry withdrew , thinking he was dreaming .: 62.65
<S> loose , half drunk , imposing , the king s musketeers , or rather m. de tre ville s , spread themselves about in the cabarets , in the public walks , and the public sports , shouting , twisting their mustaches , clanking their swords , and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them ; then drawing in the open streets , as if it were the best of all possible sports ; sometimes killed , but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged ; often killing others , but then certain of not rotting in prison , m. de tre ville being there to claim them .: 85.65
<S> nobody serves me for nothing .: 81.32
<S> she had married a younger brother of the family , who had left her a widow with one child .: 30.32
<S> my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king , the cardinal , and yourself whom he considered the first three personages in france . d artagnan added m. de tre ville to the others , as may be perceived ; but he thought this addition would do no harm .: 48.06
<S> he therefore went down the rue des petits augustins , and came up to the quay , in order to take the new bridge .: 21.14
<S> another reigns in her name .: 53.45
<S> and yet , frightful though this spot may be , it is looked upon as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered ; it is so rare for them to leave the lions den for any other place than the barrier saint jacques , the galleys !: 77.43
<S> porthos turned his head to the right and to the left , and drew himself up with a movement full of dignity .: 20.96
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79

<S> after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart , and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia , i did what a doctor would have done i inflated the lungs by blowing air into them , and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour , it began to breathe , and cried feebly .: 46.35
<S> nothing ambiguous , if you please .: 32.61
<S> oho !: 61.11
<S> the queen and de winter continued to converse for some time in low voices , in order that the young princess should not overhear them ; but the precaution was needless : she was in deep converse with her own thoughts .: 49.46
<S> will you this ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances ; then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it , so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain .: 92.94
<S> stop !: 27.26
<S> yes . well , read the letter again .: 35.51
<S> as they had long been acquainted with the king , they were not much excited ; but d artagnan , with his gascon imagination , saw in it his future fortune , and passed the night in golden dreams .: 37.41
<S> indeed , said maximilian , i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy ; at all events , he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good . ah , said valentine in a mournful tone , do let me see this man , maximilian ; he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered . my poor girl , you know him already . i know him ? yes ; it was he who saved the life of your step mother and her son . the count of monte cristo ? the same . ah , cried valentine , he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be mine . the friend of madame de villefort !: 30.86
<S> to begin with , tell me , said she , how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival , but even of the day , the hour , and the port at which i should arrive ? lord de winter adopted the same tactics as milady , thinking that as his sister in law employed them they must be the best .: 63.08
<S> at last their hilarity calmed down and : faith ! exclaimed d artagnan to the two friends , you may well wish ill to mazarin ; for i assure you , on his side he wishes you no good . pooh !: 65.63
<S> the frenchman made some resistance , and nearly strangled beppo ; but he could not resist five armed men , and was forced to yield .: 61.09
<S> monsieur , said he , as long as i hold him in this manner , he can t cry , i ll be bound ; but as soon as i let go he will howl again .: 28.02
<S> he turned up a king .: 42.59
<S> on his part the king returned to his apartment .: 16.04
<S> he renewed against danglars , fernand , and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon .: 54.06
<S> but athos was a man of inflexible determination ; he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed , when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty .: 84.27
<S> the juncture was favorable .: 47.02
<S> yes . in landed property ? no . in stock ? yes . the stock is in your own hands ? the look which m. noirtier cast on barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find .: 72.41
<S> but go a little way from france go either to aleppo or cairo , or only to naples or rome , and you will see people passing by you in the streets people erect , smiling , and fresh colored , of whom asmodeus , if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle , would say , that man was poisoned three weeks ago ; he will be a dead man in a month . then , remarked madame de villefort , they have again discovered the secret of the famous aqua tofana that they said was lost at perugia . ah , but madame , does mankind ever lose anything ?: 77.13
<S> in spite of herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave and appeared to be so much in love .: 29.30
<S> you have acted kindly , count , in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss .: 38.28
<S> dante s saw the light gradually disappear , and fearing to be surprised in the cavern , left it , his gun in his hand .: 33.10
<S> motionless , with her burning and fixed glances , in her solitary apartment , how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration , accompany the sound of the surf which rises , growls , roars , and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle !: 132.07
<S> it was this gentleman ? said d artagnan , bowing to the officer .: 14.26
<S> while you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find him . come , now , aramis , said d artagnan , you must be taking me for some one else . nevertheless , said athos , in your absence well , in my absence haven t i put in my place grimaud and the scotchman ?: 45.00
<S> they will return , said d artagnan .: 9.22
<S> du vallon next me .: 195.30
<S> if caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond , and there existed no such person as the abbe busoni , then , indeed , i was lost past redemption , or , at least , my life hung upon the feeble chance of caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth .: 64.04
<S> unfortunately , edmond s brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular .: 50.05
<S> the writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled ; they understood without speaking , their organizations were so delicate and sympathetic .: 76.21
<S> athos started .: 24.46
<S> gad !: 64.77
<S> of these 600,000 francs you took 50,000 crowns .: 56.81
<S> he had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape .: 61.89
<S> he admired the strong hands , the broad shoulders and the steady eye of porthos .: 87.31
<S> it was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal .: 19.94
<S> in the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready , but he looked around in vain for his friend .: 25.06
<S> it must be nearly four o clock .: 13.71
<S> i began to think of genii , sylphs , gnomes , in short , of all the ministers of the occult sciences , until i laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination .: 41.75
<S> i had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth , when i met friend danglars .: 65.20
<S> that poor child , said madame de villefort when valentine was gone , she makes me very uneasy , and i should not be astonished if she had some serious illness . meanwhile , valentine , in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand , had crossed edward s room without noticing some trick of the child , and through her own had reached the little staircase .: 46.57
<S> hayde e took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes .: 75.13
<S> if we can succeed in saving the king it will be good ; if we die for him it will be grand . so you know beforehand you must perish ! said d artagnan .: 41.95
<S> the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina ; then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli , the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum .: 83.13
<S> as for her , she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips , and repeated , blaspheming , that terrible name of god , by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know him .: 36.15
<S> i love to see you thus .: 27.33
<S> he was luxuriously stretched in a good english calash , with double springs ; he was drawn by four good horses , at full gallop ; he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven leagues .: 69.68
<S> i shall be obliged to give up hunting , as i have given up hawking .: 32.98
<S> m. de villefort , a true parisian , considered the cemetery of pe re lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a parisian family ; there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates .: 105.33
<S> the patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise , or even delay in its execution .: 54.65
<S> how lofty , how magnificent monsieur athos was that day , when he said to his adversary : you have insisted on knowing my name , sir ; so much the worse for you , since i shall be obliged to kill you . i was near him , those were his exact words , when he stabbed his foe as he said he would , and his adversary fell without saying , oh ! tis a noble gentleman monsieur athos . yes , true as gospel , said d artagnan ; but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities . i remember well , said planchet , he was fond of drinking in truth , he drank , but not as other men drink .: 62.03
<S> her daughter , during the severest cold , was obliged for want of fire to remain in bed .: 90.95
<S> everything , d artagnan , even folly , has its limit . then your means , it appears , are improved ; you have a capital house your own , i presume ?: 103.11
<S> the justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of god ; it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending yourself .: 41.72
<S> thank god , thank god ! yes , it is i , said d artagnan , it is i , whom god has sent to watch over you . was it with that intention you followed me ? asked the young woman , with a coquettish smile , whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence , and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy .: 38.42
<S> athos sighed deeply ; the sigh woke the king , so lightly did he sleep .: 120.05
<S> at this crisis of the battle , the prince , who had been seconding de chatillon in the second line , appeared in the midst of the fight ; his eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the hero .: 50.11
<S> if they recognize you , you are lost . care not for me , sire ; think only of yourself .: 67.93
<S> for the rest , the orders had been issued by the count ; he himself had given a plan to bertuccio , marking the spot where each tree was to be planted , and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving stones .: 39.75
<S> villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences , and then retired to his study , where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter : after all the disclosures which were made this morning , m. noirtier de villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of m. franz d e pinay .: 58.10
<S> at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river .: 16.96
<S> well , at the end of ten days you would have taken a centigramme , at the end of twenty days , increasing another milligramme , you would have taken three hundred centigrammes ; that is to say , a dose which you would support without inconvenience , and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself .: 31.73
<S> but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life ; and acting upon this principle , the banker s daughter , though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise d armilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day , took especial care not to be seen in her company .: 86.12
<S> there was no family , no servant ; the tall man alone inhabited this house .: 105.30
<S> you are a hundred times too good . begone , then , find them instantly , and let all be done tonight !: 44.27
<S> d artagnan ran after her .: 20.14
<S> you may go . the footman went out .: 19.58
<S> they re entered the boat which had brought them to the louvre and thence proceeded to the halles ; and taking up grimaud and blaisois , they went on foot to the rue guenegaud .: 36.52
<S> bazin set out the next day for tours , and was allowed eight days for performing his commission .: 82.58
<S> you would like one that sails as rapidly as lightning , interrupted mordaunt .: 71.48
<S> d artagnan , who was known as a familiar of the house , went straight to his office , and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance .: 25.27
<S> i say you wished to avenge yourself on me , and i say that it is horrible ! do not think so , brisemont , said d artagnan ; do not think so .: 21.52
<S> the door had remained open , so strong was the excitement produced by the arrival of athos , whose wound , though kept as a secret , was known to all .: 48.55
<S> in this case , however , although the occasion of the entertainment was similar , the company was strikingly dissimilar .: 43.80
<S> he has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring , and , being unsuccessful , he will soon purchase all the contiguous houses .: 48.84
<S> the count took out his watch .: 15.01
<S> the stranger , whom as yet dante s knew only by the number of his cell , sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years , and , light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard , climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dante s , and from them to his shoulders ; then , bending double , for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect , he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window , so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom .: 56.19
<S> yes ; but your father died in your arms , happy , respected , rich , and full of years ; his father died poor , despairing , almost doubtful of providence ; and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards , his tomb had disappeared , and no one could say , there sleeps the father you so well loved . oh ! exclaimed morrel .: 70.18
<S> tis true that merce de s is not actually my wife ; but , added he , drawing out his watch , in an hour and a half she will be . a general exclamation of surprise ran round the table , with the exception of the elder dante s , whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth .: 39.65
<S> are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks ? certainly , directly the curtain falls on the stage . what a confounded long time this first act lasts .: 73.68
<S> presently !: 95.94
<S> but m. de tre ville knew nothing , except that the last time he had seen the cardinal , the king , and the queen , the cardinal looked very thoughtful , the king uneasy , and the redness of the queen s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful .: 26.94
<S> at neufcha tel , go to the tavern of the golden harrow , give the password to the landlord , and you will find , as you have here , a horse ready saddled . have i anything to pay ? demanded d artagnan .: 35.55
<S> let me look for this letter ; it must be with my title deeds . d artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room , and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family .: 38.58
<S> jesu ! cried planchet , can it be ? at this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty air , and the two travelers could see , displayed in all their brilliancy , the large eyes , the vermilion visage , and the eloquent smile of mousqueton .: 53.86
<S> luigi vampa , replied the shepherd , with the same air as he would have replied , alexander , king of macedon .: 37.33
<S> what the devil would you have me do with that ? said the englishman .: 13.98
<S> well , conceal me somewhere ; you can say you were needlessly alarmed ; you can turn their suspicions and save my life ! 50053m the two ladies , pressing closely to one another , and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them , remained silent to this supplicating voice , repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds .: 74.55
<S> nothing could turn him from his purpose .: 47.71
<S> what is the matter , barrois ? said valentine .: 10.68
<S> he no longer feared realities , but phantoms .: 91.42
<S> this was the same emery who became eventually superintendent of finance .: 97.10
<S> speak out . are we threatened with a fresh reign of terror ? asked another .: 84.97
<S> the host felt a cold sweat creep down his back .: 48.28
<S> albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars , who did not appear in the least disturbed , and returned his bow with her usual coolness .: 25.14
<S> he has six millions worth . he must sell them at whatever price . why ? because don carlos has fled from bourges , and has returned to spain . 30203m how do you know ? debray shrugged his shoulders .: 60.43
<S> that can only be to hold gloves , he said .: 61.49
<S> no ; for your skill with the sword is so well known . ah ? who has betrayed me ? the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered . and you failed ? they positively refused . morrel , said the count , have you ever seen me fire a pistol ? never . well , we have time ; look . monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when merce de s entered , and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate , with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club .: 58.15
<S> you spent it as you pleased ; that was your business .: 49.57
<S> i swear to you , on my honor , said he , to await your decision respecting the course i am to pursue with m. d e pinay . that is right , said the old man .: 14.94
<S> why not ? because he is an actor in the drama . has he assassinated anyone , then ? no , on the contrary , they wished to assassinate him .: 29.40
<S> whilst this scene was going on , d artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze .: 45.72
<S> you have no longer a weapon ; and besides , i am on my guard .: 19.94
<S> outside this door a spade was placed against the wall ; i took it , and advanced towards the thicket .: 37.83
<S> on his first inquiry he was told , with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full , that there was no room for him at the ho tel de londres .: 52.33
<S> he saw a little dark man , ill made and awkward with his hands in everything except drawing a sword and firing a pistol with something haughty and contemptuous in his face .: 100.44
<S> a glance , threatening and transient as lightning , replied to raoul .: 66.22
<S> i am disposed to believe your eminence , he replied ; though i have had but little evidence of that good nature of which your eminence speaks .: 50.76
<S> ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee ; he has heard that i ordered tea , and he also knows that i brought you home with me ; when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so , and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking , he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company , and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one and now the mystery is solved . certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation , but it is not the less true that you ah , but what do i hear ? and morcerf inclined his head towards the door , through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar .: 100.58
<S> ah , you see , danglars , said caderousse , winking at his friend , this is how it is ; fernand , whom you see here , is a good and brave catalan , one of the best fishermen in marseilles , and he is in love with a very fine girl , named merce de s ; but it appears , unfortunately , that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the pharaon ; and as the pharaon arrived today why , you understand ! no ; i do not understand , said danglars .: 29.41
<S> are you satisfied , sir ? there is one thing the queen has not signed her assent to the treaty . of what use to day ?: 29.86
<S> the abbe scarron .: 16.95
<S> besides , at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent .: 22.50
<S> yes , sdeath !: 27.46
<S> the procurator , seeing he was going , invited him to dinner an invitation which the musketeer refused with a majestic air .: 55.17
<S> the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock , as did his hair under a priest s wig ; the three cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbe .: 114.37
<S> you see , said the young man , with an air of sorrowful resignation , to faria , that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you .: 33.08
<S> is it not a halt in death s anteroom ? 40026m i am prejudiced against beauchamp , said albert , drawing franz away , and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with debray .: 99.38
<S> ah , yes , said the count ; that was the reason of your running away from us . yes . how is king otho getting on ? asked albert in the most sprightly tone .: 48.72
<S> then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of madame de morcerf : pardon me , he added with a smile , i leave you , albert . albert understood his thoughts .: 51.45
<S> as soon as the door of gondy s study was opened a man rushed in .: 27.11
<S> permit me , then , my dear athos , without inquiring further about our friend , to pay my respects to m. planchet . ah , monsieur le chevalier , said planchet , bowing .: 25.14
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> and i , said athos , taking some small change from his pocket , i you ?: 28.84
<S> i think i hear a noise , she said ; leave me . good bye , for the present , replied the count , walking upon tiptoe towards the library door , and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girl s heart was filled with gratitude .: 27.69
<S> now , listen , albert .: 22.01
<S> but i can t be severe with him , he is really so bright . after the usual civilities , the count inquired after m. de villefort .: 43.87
<S> it is true also , that as i did not then know his eminence , if i had been able to dispense with the visit , i should have been enchanted . he ill treated you , then ; he threatened you ? he gave me his hand , and called me his friend .: 38.38
<S> what was passing in that brain , so loaded with dreadful secrets ?: 88.23
<S> dancers , players , talkers , all uttered an exclamation of joy everyone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in .: 104.06
<S> is he , too , a bragelonne ? asked lord de winter .: 14.24
<S> aramis , not wishing to part with his sword , selected a dark blue cloak of a military cut .: 57.41
<S> well , now i have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little madame bonacieux . who is that ? her lover . what is his name ? oh , your eminence knows him well , cried milady , carried away by her anger .: 33.08
<S> d artagnan looked much disconcerted .: 34.68
<S> m. bonacieux lived on very quietly , wholly ignorant of what had become of his wife , and caring very little about it .: 56.82
<S> replied : now as to the worthy cardinals , spada and rospigliosi , let us ask both of them to dinner , something tells me that we shall get that money back .: 107.95
<S> they breakfasted with a good appetite , looking now and then at poor raoul , who with moist eyes and a full heart , scarcely ate at all .: 96.51
<S> he had no doubt that it was the messenger from albert .: 18.99
<S> and monsieur d artagnan , of whom you spoke just now , monsieur d herblay ; may i ask if you have any news of him ? we parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached paris before us . no , sir ; i am sure he hasn t yet arrived .: 32.90
<S> the young man closed the door behind him , and advanced towards the major , who had risen when he heard steps approaching him .: 22.18
<S> maximilian morrel , said the servant , announcing two fresh guests .: 56.57
<S> five minutes elapsed , during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna ; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage , which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion .: 40.37
<S> that would carry you to the end of the world .: 18.77
<S> one of the two riders , he who had spoken second , was ten paces in front of his companion .: 40.28
<S> at this moment danglars , who had been incessantly observing every change in fernand s look and manner , saw him stagger and fall back , with an almost convulsive spasm , against a seat placed near one of the open windows .: 78.30
<S> he looked at albert he was as white as his shirt , and mechanically cast away his cigar , although he had not half smoked it .: 45.62
<S> you think ?: 39.36
<S> lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of d artagnan .: 21.32
<S> oh , what larks ! meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket , against which one of the keepers was leaning .: 73.87
<S> i suffered frightful torments .: 162.09
<S> well , i was a million in advance with him , and now my fine jacopo manfredi suspends payment ! really ? it is an unheard of fatality .: 96.99
<S> bah ! cried porthos .: 14.05
<S> you arrive in good time , dear d artagnan , said aramis , and by taking part in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence .: 48.16
<S> but this time the papers were a mere matter of form .: 41.40
<S> i pardon you for my blasted future , my lost honor , my defiled love , and my salvation forever compromised by the despair into which you have cast me .: 85.08
<S> the woman s lips seemed to move , as though she were talking ; but because she merely spoke in an undertone , or my senses were dulled by sleep , i did not catch a word she uttered .: 55.35
<S> oh , the royalists were very severe with the bonapartists in those days . monsieur , returned villefort , i was then a royalist , because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne , but the chosen of the nation .: 66.27
<S> ah ; dante s , my friend , you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship pharaon ; then turning towards edmond , who was walking away , a pleasant journey , he cried .: 60.97
<S> the baron knows , as well as myself , that milady de winter is a very guilty woman , and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to transportation . the duke put his pen to the paper .: 46.41
<S> undoubtedly , said villefort , moderating the tones of his voice , a marriage once concerted and then broken off , throws a sort of discredit on a young lady ; then again , the old reports , which i was so anxious to put an end to , will instantly gain ground .: 92.63
<S> at the same time he pointed to a window , through the shutters of which a faint light streamed .: 20.52
<S> he is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence .: 39.21
<S> yes betrayed by the scotch , amongst whom i was born , whom i have always loved better than the english .: 52.12
<S> do you know the count of monte cristo ? you mean monsieur zaccone , i presume ? zaccone ? is not his name monte cristo ? monte cristo is the name of an estate , or , rather , of a rock , and not a family name . well , be it so let us not dispute about words ; and since m. de monte cristo and m. zaccone are the same absolutely the same . let us speak of m. zaccone . agreed . i asked you if you knew him ? extremely well . who is he ? the son of a rich shipbuilder in malta . i know that is the report ; but , as you are aware , the police does not content itself with vague reports . however , replied the abbe , with an affable smile , when that report is in accordance with the truth , everybody must believe it , the police as well as all the rest . are you sure of what you assert ? what do you mean by that question ? understand , sir , i do not in the least suspect your veracity ; i ask if you are certain of it ? i knew his father , m. zaccone . ah , indeed ? and when a child i often played with the son in the timber yards . but whence does he derive the title of count ? you are aware that may be bought . in italy ? everywhere . and his immense riches , whence does he procure them ? they may not be so very great . how much do you suppose he possesses ? from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum . that is reasonable , said the visitor ; i have heard he had three or four millions . two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital . but i was told he had four millions per annum . that is not probable . do you know this island of monte cristo ? certainly , everyone who has come from palermo , naples , or rome to france by sea must know it , since he has passed close to it and must have seen it . i am told it is a delightful place ? it is a rock . and why has the count bought a rock ? for the sake of being a count .: 42.49
<S> what is it you want ? said the inspector .: 8.69
<S> the king has made him a baron , and can make him a peer , but he can not make him a gentleman , and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent , for the paltry sum of two million francs , to a me salliance .: 38.48
<S> alone !: 58.92
<S> anne of austria at the age of forty six .: 25.98
<S> well , are you going away in that manner ?: 20.16
<S> what an injustice , my dear invalid !: 51.85
<S> gentlemen , he said in a hoarse voice , give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves ! the two men drew back .: 40.60
<S> and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voiture s works , but i am of the same opinion as the coadjutor he is a poet , a true poet . aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody .: 49.90
<S> i felt for it , found it , twisted it up together , and putting it into the expiring flame , set light to it .: 85.42
<S> both laid themselves down on the divan ; chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach , and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice .: 158.76
<S> sir , suddenly exclaimed the countess , after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence , is it true that you have seen so much , travelled so far , and suffered so deeply ? i have suffered deeply , madame , answered monte cristo .: 46.50
<S> they stopped at the sign of the fox , in the rue du vieux colombier , a tavern known for many years by athos , and asked for two bedrooms .: 41.52
<S> they sing let them pay the piper .: 114.88
<S> yes , doubtless ; and is it not that he may never do us any harm ? merce de s shuddered , and , fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze , you speak strangely , said she to albert , and you appear to have some singular prejudices .: 40.77
<S> he has neither robbed , nor killed , nor murdered . hold your tongue ! said danglars .: 52.41
<S> but , added the queen , in awaiting the cardinal s decision let there be , if you please , a reference to the king only . the deputies bowed and left the room .: 38.03
<S> captain , said he , just now carlini would not drink your health when i proposed it to him ; propose mine to him , and let us see if he will be more condescending to you than to me . everyone expected an explosion on carlini s part ; but to their great surprise , he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other , and filling it , your health , diavolaccio , said he calmly , and he drank it off , without his hand trembling in the least .: 48.88
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> what for five years he had been wanting a faithful servant , a friend , a helping hand seemed to have fallen from heaven just when he expected it the least .: 75.81
<S> to the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silence unbroken , save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above .: 110.06
<S> ho , friend ! said benedetto .: 31.84
<S> will you go away from here ? demanded the swiss , stamping violently , like a man who begins to be seriously angry .: 43.04
<S> but this unexpected , unhoped for , unheard of fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it ; you wished to double it , and how ? by a murder !: 114.42
<S> 8 brucea ferruginea .: 152.85
<S> the misfortune is great ; but i think you have still a good number of falcons , sparrow hawks , and tiercels . and not a man to instruct them .: 56.27
<S> maximilian ! she exclaimed , and so sweet did the sound appear to her , that she repeated it maximilian ! has he then owned all to you ? everything .: 81.45
<S> blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise .: 93.27
<S> d artagnan ! ejaculated athos .: 17.88
<S> the promise volume four chapter 74 .: 125.29
<S> then i shall recognize you as my nephew , for you would be a worthy son of such a mother . no , replied mordaunt , forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm ; no , i shall not kill you ; at least not at this moment , for without you i could not discover the others .: 43.67
<S> franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other , then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment .: 25.10
<S> edward , cried m. de villefort , so harshly that the child started up from the floor , do you hear me ? go ! the child , unaccustomed to such treatment , arose , pale and trembling ; it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion .: 34.25
<S> his desire for blood returned , burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever ; he arose in his turn , reached his hand to his belt , drew forth a pistol , and cocked it .: 43.81
<S> to london ! cried porthos ; and what the devil are we going to do in london ? that is what i am not at liberty to tell you , gentlemen ; you must trust to me . but in order to go to london , added porthos , money is needed , and i have none . nor i , said aramis .: 22.90
<S> around this opening , which had , possibly , for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile , grew a quantity of creeping plants , whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament , while large masses of thick , strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm , and hung floating to and fro , like so many waving strings .: 157.53
<S> now to the point .: 32.62
<S> cheer up , said she to noirtier .: 37.23
<S> the host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day , but he had reckoned without his guest .: 78.44
<S> and yet we must be drawing near the disclosure . m .: 47.47
<S> whether he kept a watch over himself , or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched , he was tonight like everybody else .: 77.69
<S> then who reigns in france at this moment napoleon ii .: 79.19
<S> and the more he thought , the more entire was his conviction , that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer , sinbad the sailor . 20139m under any other circumstances , franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage , and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance ; but in the present instance , the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him , with propriety , judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable .: 78.86
<S> we even have , as you may have heard , introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles , which in blowing up made a very pretty breach .: 84.09
<S> must see him !: 117.48
<S> and , wonderful to see , in front of the tower of saint jean , was a ship bearing on her stern these words , printed in white letters , the pharaon , morrel son , of marseilles . she was the exact duplicate of the other pharaon , and loaded , as that had been , with cochineal and indigo .: 71.75
<S> do you know that i was plunged during a day and night in a dungeon of the bastille ? oh , a day and night soon pass away .: 52.35
<S> it is all as he has said ; it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor . then , turning towards the paralytic , he said , you possess , then , 900,000 francs of capital , which , according to the manner in which you have invested it , ought to bring in an income of about 40,000 livres ? yes . to whom do you desire to leave this fortune ? oh ! said madame de villefort , there is not much doubt on that subject .: 34.97
<S> to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow ?: 132.18
<S> he was the worst musketeer and the most unconvivial companion imaginable .: 54.27
<S> nevertheless , rapid as the movement had been , d artagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old man .: 22.52
<S> after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage , sheathing on the way his now useless sword , and thus reached the neighboring house , where he paused to examine himself and to take breath .: 100.54
<S> her mistress was mad with love , intoxicated with joy .: 42.03
<S> some of these boats were dark and mysterious , others noisy and lighted up with torches .: 58.26
<S> if you had been a man , you would not have let him go from here . woman ! or else he should not have reached beaucaire . woman ! the road takes a turn he is obliged to follow it while alongside of the canal there is a shorter road . woman ! you offend the good god .: 111.46
<S> the whole world conspires to break our bonds .: 84.74
<S> i forget .: 50.64
<S> dante s heard joyfully the key grate in the lock ; he listened until the sound of steps died away , and then , hastily displacing his bed , saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell , that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it .: 57.68
<S> at this moment a horse without a rider , covered with foam , his nostrils extended and eyes all fire , galloped up , and recognizing his master , stopped and neighed with pleasure ; it was arthur .: 52.71
<S> another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging , while a fifth clung to the broken rudder .: 123.94
<S> the unhappy young man had not thought of this .: 20.60
<S> what are his means of existence ?: 41.71
<S> there , duke , said he , you were right and i was wrong .: 18.72
<S> certes , said aramis , i do justice to the beauties of this thesis ; but at the same time i perceive it would be overwhelming for me .: 27.66
<S> old age is selfish , sir , and mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful companion to m. noirtier , which she can not be when she becomes the baroness d e pinay .: 27.88
<S> i have devoted myself to industry ; i study the useful arts .: 89.20
<S> at last they lost sight of each other .: 18.50
<S> for a moment d artagnan thought that parry s brother had disappeared ; but he was mistaken .: 21.80
<S> wretched men ! their officers wish to see you , sir . i have no time to see them .: 47.87
<S> all this the young man perceived , and yet , to his praise we speak it , he did not hesitate a second .: 48.73
<S> my lord de winter , continued athos , what is the penalty you demand against this woman ? the punishment of death , replied lord de winter .: 19.72
<S> i have given the signal . for what ? for the barricades .: 41.01
<S> what magistrate would find , or even venture to insinuate , anything against this ?: 164.95
<S> but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired , and the flame , rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano , soon reached the tapestry , which it quickly devoured .: 70.70
<S> there was neither dining , nor playing at cards , nor dancing in that house .: 105.55
<S> kitty will conduct you to my chamber . the poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words .: 38.94
<S> my friend !: 14.96
<S> the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began .: 54.61
<S> from that time , d artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them , and he therefore placed in the pocket of mme .: 38.27
<S> danglars threw himself upon his goat skin , and peppino , reclosing the door , again began eating his peas and bacon .: 49.06
<S> here is the relic , she said ; do not think it will be less dear to us now we are acquainted with our benefactor ! my child , said monte cristo , coloring , allow me to take back that purse ?: 32.99
<S> if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues , and their guardians consented to accompany them , they would have a capital chance of escaping . the scheme is well known , said the inspector ; and the abbe s plan has not even the merit of originality . then turning to faria , i inquired if you are well fed ? said he .: 43.29
<S> your father was fortunate , then ? said he .: 29.80
<S> the face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her .: 14.76
<S> they stamped upon the carpet with their feet ; they bit their lips till the blood came , and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might .: 49.41
<S> on his return home , albert expressed his wish to franz debray , and morrel , to see them at the opera that evening .: 44.14
<S> the banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard , and advanced to meet him with a sad , though affable smile .: 31.99
<S> he had not been more than ten minutes in the drawing room before he drew danglars aside into the recess of a bow window , and , after an ingenious preamble , related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble father s departure .: 50.15
<S> ali , smiling , repeated the sound , grasped the reins with a firm hand , and spurred his horses , whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze .: 51.02
<S> tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine , no .: 27.83
<S> it was evident that she had shared the grief of the family , for she was pale and looked fatigued .: 23.63
<S> to morrow we shall retake lens and beat the enemy . then , turning toward raoul : go , monsieur , he said ; ride fast and give this letter to monsieur de grammont . raoul bowed , took the letter , went hastily down the mountain , leaped on his horse and set out at a gallop .: 35.95
<S> but , blaisois ventured to say , i have heard you relate , monsieur mousqueton , that once on a time , at chantilly , you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare , carp with a line , and bottles with a slipnoose . perfectly true ; but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles .: 80.12
<S> but harrison paid not the least attention to him , and entering the king s room , followed by his companion : charles stuart , said he , an order has come to conduct you to london without stopping day or night .: 51.87
<S> the clock of the invalides struck a quarter to twelve ; the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes .: 93.57
<S> ah , here is one of them , i believe . in fact , at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared .: 20.04
<S> anne de bueil , murmured the wounded man .: 17.83
<S> certainly , as he had himself owned , the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow .: 58.45
<S> on saturday , at six o clock .: 11.59
<S> yes , i have something of the highest importance to tell you . true , said he , and i have some questions sufficiently serious to put to you .: 23.27
<S> mordaunt followed the carriage , and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended , and remained motionless , amidst the moldings of jean goujon , like a bas relievo , representing an equestrian statue .: 77.45
<S> he loi se de villefort .: 16.86
<S> franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage .: 71.90
<S> sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue , looking towards marseilles , at other times gazing on the sea , and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean , and thus end her woes .: 54.21
<S> so much the better !: 8.35
<S> i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle , and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de conde , monsieur de bassopierre , or some valiant gentleman whose business is war , and not me , who am a churchman , and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude .: 56.15
<S> but to return to what you were saying , beauchamp . well , do you know why they die so multitudinously at m. de villefort s ? multitudinously is good , said cha teau renaud .: 26.15
<S> in ugliness , in so far as a man can resemble a woman . ah !: 52.85
<S> she is quite well , replied danglars quickly ; she is at the piano with m. cavalcanti . albert retained his calm and indifferent manner ; he might feel perhaps annoyed , but he knew monte cristo s eye was on him .: 42.67
<S> you are right , father ; i understand you . then extending his hand towards one of the pistols , he said , there is one for you and one for me thanks ! morrel caught his hand .: 30.16
<S> as they were passing onward , athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume , and assume a dress more suited to the city .: 72.53
<S> nothing , nothing !: 29.75
<S> you must have much to tell me , since you have come to seek me . 50155m well , be it so .: 29.57
<S> help , help ! screamed she , turning towards the wall , as if she would tear an opening with her hands .: 21.82
<S> i would then rather die . truly , murmured valentine , who on this earth cares for me , if he does not ?: 53.45
<S> ho !: 16.63
<S> besides , said the abbe , god is merciful to all , as he has been to you ; he is first a father , then a judge . do you then believe in god ? said caderousse .: 38.39
<S> your honors , said he , that woman had a child ; that child has become a man ; the tigress had a little one , the tiger has roused himself ; he is ready to spring upon you beware ! athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile .: 55.37
<S> he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk .: 62.35
<S> the pleasure of seeing you .: 30.68
<S> then he resumed in his turn : discipline , monseigneur , has , i hope , in no way been forgotten by us .: 42.60
<S> poor fernand has been dismissed , continued caderousse .: 54.36
<S> he attempted to ride over those gray cloaks , but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the rue saint honore , leaving four of his guards dead on the field of battle .: 60.35
<S> you ask me why i have requested this interview ; i will tell you in two words , sir ; i will not marry count andrea cavalcanti . danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven .: 29.32
<S> he was now fairly launched in that parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners , and treats them , not as they really are , but as they wish to be considered .: 75.33
<S> pardon me , then , a fault which is perhaps great , but which certainly was involuntary . milady was so beautiful at this moment , the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance , that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard .: 61.94
<S> my mass ? lord de winter , the corrupted catholic , knows very well that i am not of his religion , and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me ! and of what religion are you , then , madame ? asked felton , with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely conceal .: 41.53
<S> whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwell s tent , d artagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle .: 33.31
<S> the next morning , on awaking , paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance .: 27.60
<S> this burden , almost as heavy as a world , which i had raised , and i had thought to bear to the end , was too great for my strength , and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career .: 35.80
<S> neither gold nor rank ? you have given me all you can give me , and from to day your debt is paid . and mordaunt darted out of the general s tent , his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy .: 60.80
<S> but tell me , what were you thinking about when i came in ? oh , i was arranging a little surprise for you . indeed .: 30.12
<S> only , continued m. d avrigny , with a slow and solemn tone , if anyone falls ill in your house , if you feel yourself attacked , do not send for me , for i will come no more .: 35.47
<S> the baroness porthos will sound particularly charming . and the two friends began to laugh .: 72.06
<S> villefort leaped out of the carriage , and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return ; he could read no other expression on their features .: 39.08
<S> come with us , said albert .: 14.46
<S> all the other guests followed .: 52.45
<S> it does not signify , gentlemen , continued the cardinal , without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which athos had started , it does not signify , gentlemen .: 32.90
<S> no , sir . and i think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you ? a glass of wine will be extremely welcome . the fish bites the fish bites ! whispered the gascon to porthos .: 33.27
<S> but morrel saw nothing ; he had grasped the hand of valentine , and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets .: 69.83
<S> never , replied the count , who was by this time perfectly master of himself again .: 36.67
<S> ah , these musketeers of yours are very devils fellows to be hanged . no , sire , replied tre ville , who saw at the first glance how things would go , on the contrary , they are good creatures , as meek as lambs , and have but one desire , i ll be their warranty .: 37.19
<S> do you hear ? well , well , rejoined the leader , there s no doubt tis a gascon who is speaking , and therefore not the man we are looking for .: 40.33
<S> sometimes he would fall into long reveries , sigh heavily and involuntarily , then suddenly rise , and , with folded arms , begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon .: 92.49
<S> you shall relate them to me , my child .: 24.95
<S> pardon my frankness , too , my lord . i am obliged to you , count , for this pleasing intelligence !: 33.26
<S> lord de winter ! exclaimed the count .: 9.25
<S> where are you going ? asked dante s .: 6.64
<S> d artagnan in his fortieth year .: 20.31
<S> i do not like to disturb those who pray , madame , said felton , seriously ; do not disturb yourself on my account , i beseech you . how do you know i was praying , sir ? said milady , in a voice broken by sobs .: 21.21
<S> look after the house , wife , and i shall be back in two hours , and caderousse left the house in haste , and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had taken .: 46.20
<S> he has escaped by this means , exclaimed he .: 25.56
<S> and you did not tell him that you came from me ? no , sir . at ten o clock athos , with his habitual exactitude , was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter .: 20.76
<S> you say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house to god s anger well , who says your supposition is not reality ?: 117.97
<S> the most perfect tranquillity was restored , and the vigilance of the custom house officers was redoubled , and their strictness was increased at this time , in consequence of the fair at beaucaire .: 78.31
<S> i will go myself and fetch the lemonade . d avrigny bounded towards the door , flew down the back staircase , and almost knocked down madame de villefort , in his haste , who was herself going down to the kitchen .: 36.77
<S> you will get yourself exiled , as you did in the time of louis xiii .: 35.57
<S> thank god , my child was not then dead ! no , it was not dead . and you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy ?: 36.45
<S> we have met him twice at general cromwell s .: 54.95
<S> you are at home , said he .: 8.42
<S> where was i then ?: 38.21
<S> a woman will sell you for ten pistoles , witness delilah .: 106.41
<S> i have remarked also another thing , said athos , which is , that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched .: 98.67
<S> let us go to breakfast . i shall be happy to do so ; the morning air has made me hungry . yes , said porthos ; my air is excellent . they went into the chateau ; there was nothing but gilding , high and low ; the cornices were gilt , the mouldings were gilt , the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt .: 37.38
<S> do not lull yourself in security , or you will be lost ; but , on the contrary and it is i who say it see enemies in all directions .: 47.30
<S> then there is his son , andrea , a charming young man , about your own age , viscount , bearing the same title as yourself , and who is making his entry into the parisian world , aided by his father s millions .: 34.32
<S> villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment , and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word .: 25.11
<S> now i thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was going .: 43.44
<S> i shall die of it ; oh , yes , i shall certainly die of it ! and then , falling upon the chair nearest the door , she burst into a paroxysm of sobs .: 24.18
<S> one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you , and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into stone .: 75.51
<S> take this pen , and write ! caderousse , awed by the superior power of the abbe , sat down and wrote : sir , the man whom you are receiving at your house , and to whom you intend to marry your daughter , is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at toulon .: 32.77
<S> stand aside ! he cried ; stand off the road ! what do you want ? asked a voice .: 20.86
<S> are we going to continue this pace all night ? asked planchet .: 36.85
<S> the king !: 16.63
<S> laporte , said the duke , in a dying voice , laporte , do you come from her ? yes , monseigneur , replied the faithful cloak bearer of anne of austria , but too late , perhaps . silence , laporte , you may be overheard .: 31.94
<S> but whither shall we fly whither escape ? let us first withdraw from this house ; afterward we shall see . the young woman and the young man , without taking the trouble to shut the door after them , descended the rue des fossoyeurs rapidly , turned into the rue des fosse s monsieur le prince , and did not stop till they came to the place st. sulpice .: 50.34
<S> noirtier continued to look at the same object , but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband , and villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes , which , while changing their direction and even their language , had lost none of their menacing expression .: 78.98
<S> it is easier and less noisy than the door . grimaud began to scale the wall again .: 58.77
<S> his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew , and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time .: 49.27
<S> if i am guilty , if i have committed the crimes you accuse me of , shrieked milady , take me before a tribunal .: 49.51
<S> they passed into the next drawing room , where tea was prepared .: 28.70
<S> danglars left ?: 300.95
<S> no , fernand , you will not thus give way to evil thoughts .: 49.34
<S> but let us return to business . yes . i was going to say , if i were in your place well . i would realize how would you realize ? i would ask for six months in advance , under pretence of being able to purchase a farm , then with my six months i would decamp . well , well , said andrea , that isn t a bad idea . my dear friend , said caderousse , eat of my bread , and take my advice ; you will be none the worse off , physically or morally . but , said andrea , why do you not act on the advice you gave me ?: 41.45
<S> will you tell me that your three damned musketeers , athos , porthos , and aramis , and your youngster from be arn , have not fallen , like so many furies , upon poor bernajoux , and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably by this time he is dead ?: 58.71
<S> in one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road .: 27.92
<S> a lady , it was said , had just fainted ; they had supplied her with a smelling bottle , and she had recovered .: 49.81
<S> don t ask me for counsel ; don t tell me you are perplexed what to do .: 58.51
<S> mazarin himself , who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household , was alarmed .: 65.51
<S> the sound was heard by the people about ali , who instantly opened the box door .: 41.20
<S> go to bed and sleep ; at dinnertime we will rouse you . although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep , sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart , ever thirsting for intrigues , she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior .: 116.49
<S> the casket passed around the table , but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand .: 84.22
<S> who and what are you ? demanded villefort , turning over a pile of papers , containing information relative to the prisoner , that a police agent had given to him on his entry , and that , already , in an hour s time , had swelled to voluminous proportions , thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim .: 48.44
<S> when porthos had left him to give some orders he saw mousqueton approaching .: 37.78
<S> m. de tre ville contented himself with asking d artagnan if he could do anything for him , but d artagnan answered that he was supplied with all he wanted .: 22.90
<S> pass on your way , then ; it is the best thing to do . this raillery exasperated jussac .: 32.75
<S> not a penny of what i possess will pass into your hands .: 44.24
<S> the king opened it , and found in it two diamond studs .: 48.60
<S> for france , were i to specify my wishes , i should have too much .: 44.20
<S> i mean m. de villefort , the king s attorney . ah , said the priest , in a marked italian accent ; yes , i have heard that death is in that house . then i need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you . i was about to offer myself , sir , said the priest ; it is our mission to forestall our duties . it is a young girl . i know it , sir ; the servants who fled from the house informed me .: 29.71
<S> was struck with this insistence , and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery .: 108.79
<S> knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by ? friquet counterfeited surprise , and twisting his new cap around in his fingers , said : it is not astonishing for you to know it , monsieur broussel , who knows everything ; but as for me , by holy truth , i did not know it and i thought i would give you good advice ; you must not be angry with me for that , monsieur broussel . on the contrary , my boy , on the contrary , i am pleased with your zeal .: 48.70
<S> d artagnan threw down a yet smoking pistol which he held in his hand , and fell on his knees before his mistress .: 30.49
<S> i do not reproach you , athos , for what you have done .: 21.33
<S> albert kissed his mother s hand , and drew near the count .: 14.72
<S> d artagnan reassured her as well as he could , and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of milady .: 19.94
<S> oh , yes . that is well . and bertuccio , feeling in his pocket , signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the wicket .: 33.96
<S> the coadjutor possessed , perhaps , as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him .: 95.07
<S> at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened , and a woman appeared .: 17.90
<S> he grants a full pardon to the vizier ali , and not only gives him his life , but restores to him his fortune and his possessions . my mother uttered a cry of joy , and clasped me to her bosom .: 45.29
<S> seven o clock in the morning !: 12.84
<S> we have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men , and while i sleep monsieur du vallon watches . ah !: 47.41
<S> this chase was , however , advantageous to him in one sense , for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead , his heart began to cool .: 38.01
<S> he opened it and read as follows : dear m. d artagnan , it is wrong thus to neglect your friends , particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time .: 35.38
<S> kill a woman ?: 158.82
<S> and when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution , continued d artagnan .: 35.61
<S> i will answer for that . you know , sir , said the governor , persisting , that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination .: 28.60
<S> the pates were excellent , the wine delicious .: 96.24
<S> 18 lake maggiore .: 175.77
<S> morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m. de villefort , and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands , the stiff neck , and the purple lips .: 41.05
<S> beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated ; his story , however , had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living things over the coldness of dead things .: 87.55
<S> then he mentally added , still my unknown protector !: 149.77
<S> this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting .: 57.36
<S> the deuce ! cried d artagnan .: 7.94
<S> i have but one portmanteau . i dare say you have nothing else with you .: 37.53
<S> you ? yes . you have them ? i have them . ah , indeed ? said the major , who , seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers , feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48,000 francs ah , indeed , that is a fortunate circumstance ; yes , that really is lucky , for it never occurred to me to bring them . i do not at all wonder at it one can not think of everything ; but , happily , the abbe busoni thought for you . he is an excellent person . he is extremely prudent and thoughtful . he is an admirable man , said the major ; and he sent them to you ? here they are . the major clasped his hands in token of admiration .: 36.64
<S> the adieux were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the other not that m. d artagnan did not love his son , who was his only offspring , but m. d artagnan was a man , and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings ; whereas mme .: 38.01
<S> take your handkerchief ; whether it belongs to you or another , you may perhaps stand in need of it . monsieur is a gascon ? asked aramis .: 43.11
<S> then you must not pay us ; we can scud , like the pharaon , under bare poles . enough , enough ! cried morrel , almost overpowered ; leave me , i pray you ; we shall meet again in a happier time .: 52.35
<S> he , however , arrived without accident in the camp established before la rochelle , on the tenth of the month of september of the year 1627 .: 34.38
<S> he had his musketeers therefore , as louis xiii .: 39.29
<S> you say you were on the point of being made captain of the pharaon ? yes . and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl ? yes . now , could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things ?: 39.55
<S> however , the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belief .: 59.81
<S> albert , had you been a stranger , a foreigner , a simple lord , like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since , and whom i killed to get rid of , i should not have taken this trouble ; but i thought this mark of consideration due to you .: 50.53
<S> you have done for me , as you promised , all that you could do .: 31.41
<S> but supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features , and the daughter of henry iv .: 68.72
<S> you are not joking , are you ? no , on the honor of an officer ; there is the half pistole ; and he showed him the seductive coin , but did not give it him .: 31.90
<S> besides , whether at home or not , whether in paris or cairo , the abbe always left something to give away , which the valet distributed through this wicket in his master s name .: 83.62
<S> aramis pushed his back into his saddle bags and sheathed his sword .: 33.70
<S> and now , gentlemen , i wish you good morning , said monte cristo .: 13.31
<S> that is , whether you really love me ? i have given you proof of that , it seems to me . and i am yours , body and soul ! thanks , my brave lover ; but as you are satisfied of my love , you must , in your turn , satisfy me of yours .: 31.30
<S> he proposed to fernand to accompany him ; fernand agreed to do so , deserted his post , and followed the general .: 54.68
<S> morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny , and monte cristo hastened to join bertuccio .: 33.40
<S> welcome to ye . thanks , my lord .: 59.64
<S> athos glanced at aramis .: 35.02
<S> you are certainly a prodigy ; you will soon not only surpass the railway , which would not be very difficult in france , but even the telegraph . but , viscount , since we can not perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours , do not keep me waiting . do not fear , i have little to prepare . monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert , then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation .: 56.29
<S> he desired kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was , and that he would be obedient to her orders .: 27.66
<S> i went out as if to fetch wood , passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar , and whilst parry was gently bolting the door , pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me .: 51.18
<S> fortunately the storm began to subside , but still the sea was disturbed .: 43.86
<S> pe re pamphile had seen dante s pass not ten minutes before ; and assured that he was at the catalans , they sat down under the budding foliage of the planes and sycamores , in the branches of which the birds were singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring .: 66.54
<S> beauchamp repeated the name to himself , as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright , and then gave orders for him to be admitted .: 25.84
<S> the thirty two that we shall use tonight are its progeny ; they are all entirely black , with the exception of a star upon the forehead . that is perfectly admirable ; but what do you do , count , with all these horses ? you see , i travel with them . but you are not always travelling . when i no longer require them , bertuccio will sell them , and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale . but no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them . then he will sell them to some eastern vizier , who will empty his coffers to purchase them , and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects . count , may i suggest one idea to you ? certainly . it is that , next to you , bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in europe . you are mistaken , viscount ; i believe he has not a franc in his possession . then he must be a wonder .: 65.10
<S> but to resume my story ; i turned towards my grandfather , as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion ; he looked expressively at the newspaper i had been reading .: 40.36
<S> he is to bring us five fresh horses one for his eminence , four for us .: 52.30
<S> is it large ? middling . how is it arranged ? faith , i should require pen , ink , and paper to make a plan . they are all here , said caderousse , briskly .: 38.98
<S> do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control ?: 45.84
<S> spur , spur ! and he fired two pistols .: 45.34
<S> there s one just arrived , and she handed the letter to d artagnan .: 24.25
<S> with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea , while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud .: 38.47
<S> i will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me , and if he keep his word and interest himself for me , in six months i shall be an officer , or dead .: 44.92
<S> yes , motioned the latter , with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant , who both knew what his wishes were , he was quite prepared to maintain the contest .: 37.25
<S> you know her , it seems ? said cha teau renaud .: 12.59
<S> at the same time , added cha teau renaud , your count of monte cristo is a very fine fellow , always excepting his little arrangements with the italian banditti . there are no italian banditti , said debray .: 37.74
<S> if , after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten , you see that i do not recover , then pour the rest down my throat .: 71.94
<S> my lord ! cried d artagnan , enlightened by a sudden idea , my lord !: 17.60
<S> the prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door ; no one ventured to speak , for fear of disturbing him .: 30.66
<S> now his plans were fully made , and this is what he intended to do .: 28.46
<S> john felton , i put faith in your loyalty ! my lord , said the young officer , summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart , my lord , i swear all shall be done as you desire . milady received this look like a resigned victim ; it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance .: 48.75
<S> no , indeed ! cried d artagnan .: 6.14
<S> love .: 159.13
<S> what is that news ? asked d artagnan .: 7.25
<S> all this she owes to d artagnan , without doubt .: 27.93
<S> yes and no .: 51.47
<S> i say , that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension , i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing , but to pass to another .: 70.92
<S> but although her voice sweet , full , and sonorous vibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever , the door remained shut .: 96.63
<S> i beg you to do so . i beg you to excuse me , madame ; i wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken . mistaken ! cried the queen , almost suffocated by emotion ; mistaken !: 34.94
<S> and towards whom do you bear this personal ill feeling , then ? said morcerf , turning pale with anger .: 53.74
<S> about seven o clock in the evening , the boatman had taken over a young woman , wrapped in a black mantle , who appeared to be very anxious not to be recognized ; but entirely on account of her precautions , the boatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was young and pretty .: 31.87
<S> and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond , which she thinks you know . and so saying , mazarin extended his hand to the officer , who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des essarts .: 32.69
<S> i dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt .: 92.51
<S> i am the most wretched of men .: 21.08
<S> i shall soon return ; and if you will wait only a few minutes for me , as soon as i have concluded my business with that friend , as it is growing late , i will come back and reconduct you to the louvre . thank you , monsieur , you are not brave enough to be of any use to me whatever , replied mme .: 32.92
<S> with the frenchman , the man who had followed him entered too ; the frenchman knocked at the inner door , and entered the first room ; his shadow did the same .: 40.99
<S> ah ! cried the dying man , with all the effusiveness of a grief declared after long suppression , ah !: 61.33
<S> well ? said d artagnan , at last .: 10.39
<S> section 3 .: 18.45
<S> it has arrived at the ho tel des princes , rue de richelieu .: 10.52
<S> and m. de monte cristo , king of china , emperor of cochin china , said the young imp , looking slyly towards his sister .: 49.70
<S> that was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of february .: 62.41
<S> on entering the room , noirtier s eyes met those of the abbe , and no doubt he read some particular expression in them , for he remained in the room .: 35.17
<S> lucullus dines with lucullus , that is quite sufficient . bertuccio bowed , and left the room .: 38.15
<S> i comprehend .: 31.93
<S> villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment , as if rooted to their seats ; they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances .: 46.90
<S> at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet .: 32.47
<S> at nine o clock next morning she arose , and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity , she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night ; then running downstairs , she left the hotel , walked to the rue de provence , called a cab , and drove to m. de villefort s house .: 36.72
<S> strength and sagacity continued .: 55.49
<S> in fact , in addition to that yellow , sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood , and which might , besides , be accidental , d artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance .: 64.82
<S> then , are your names , gentlemen ? the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay , said aramis .: 11.24
<S> we shall have our revenge .: 21.35
<S> all doubt of his identity was now at an end ; his singular host evidently resided at rome .: 74.72
<S> let him be interred in holy ground .: 43.02
<S> twenty witnesses , added he , could attest the fact ; and he named several distinguished gentlemen , and among them was m. le duc de la tre mouille .: 67.61
<S> of course , we hope that you will support the project gutenberg mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg name associated with the work .: 14.82
<S> now , if they believed us , they laughed in order to insult us ; if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more .: 62.86
<S> and at this moment , perhaps , felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury ! a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes .: 76.21
<S> both of the visitors , after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois , a faithful servant , who had been twenty five years in his service , took their places on either side of the paralytic .: 38.91
<S> d artagnan took his hand .: 7.48
<S> i was , as i told him , resolved to die of hunger .: 18.51
<S> he placed his hand on his dagger and stopped .: 20.24
<S> the house may be suspected ; but i deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur d artagnan , for i can affirm , sire , if i can believe what he says , that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your majesty , or a more profound admirer of monsieur the cardinal . was it not this d artagnan who wounded jussac one day , in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the convent of the carmes de chausse s ? asked the king , looking at the cardinal , who colored with vexation .: 40.58
<S> you will retract this assertion , will you not , beauchamp ? said albert with increased though stifled anger .: 52.10
<S> go , then , animal , said the duke ; but remember , i only allow you half an hour . may i promise your custom to the successor of father marteau , my lord ? yes , if he does not put mushrooms in his pies ; thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of vincennes are fatal to my family . la ramee went out , but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a moment .: 39.75
<S> run for help ! cried grimaud , and i will remain beside him here . the host quitted the room in agitation , and as for his wife , she had fled at the sound of her husband s cries .: 30.36
<S> and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went .: 78.76
<S> what the devil are you doing here , count ? accomplishing my destiny , replied rochefort , falling on one knee .: 26.67
<S> then she rang for her lady s maid , and , weak as she was , she dressed , in order to be ready for whatever might happen .: 44.59
<S> monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion ; he was at the window , calling : ali , a horse for m. de morcerf quick !: 54.34
<S> in the rue de seine he met planchet , who had stopped before the house of a pastry cook , and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most appetizing appearance .: 48.53
<S> euge nie , she said to herself , is lost , and so are we .: 37.16
<S> d artagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out .: 21.32
<S> here ? yes , here , in this convent , my dear fellow .: 25.00
<S> i am almost inclined to ask you , as though you had experienced death , is it painful to die ? monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable tenderness .: 35.06
<S> do not be alarmed , maximilian ; it is nothing , and has already passed away .: 26.53
<S> from congo , if you will . it must be farther off than even that . but what do i know of your parisian husbands ? oh , my dear count , husbands are pretty much the same everywhere ; an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race . but then , what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray ?: 68.10
<S> mine was carried away by a ball .: 44.95
<S> it seemed to all three that they knew him .: 35.67
<S> you , whom i expected last , you arrive at five minutes to ten , when the time fixed was half past !: 62.34
<S> besides , she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of everything .: 53.55
<S> but raoul was not at the hotel du grand charlemagne .: 21.32
<S> god preserve me from another such hour as i have just passed . then you know that i did not leave him ? i heard your voice up to the last moment . here is the order he gave me and the cross i took from his hand ; he desired they should be returned to the queen . then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in , replied athos , drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the king s blood .: 47.46
<S> grimaud seemed to him an antinous .: 70.42
<S> you know , said the abbe , that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal spada , the last of the princes of that name .: 38.78
<S> he thought himself strong enough , for he mistook fever for energy .: 102.44
<S> he is a little stiff and pompous in his manner , and he is disfigured by his uniform ; but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the austrian service , all that will be pardoned .: 34.19
<S> you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend ? he asked of franz .: 24.50
<S> he held some papers in his hand ; his countenance was calm , and his step firm , and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform , which was buttoned completely up to the chin .: 37.17
<S> once in london we shall be hard to find without considering , continued athos , throwing a glance at aramis , the chances that may come to us on the way . yes , said aramis , i understand . i , however , do not understand , said porthos .: 28.69
<S> they are worth about fifty thousand pounds .: 27.31
<S> beyond the fortifications through which athos had made a breach in order to get out , and which were composed of fagots , planks , and empty casks , heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art , they found , swimming in puddles of oil and wine , the bones and fragments of all the hams they had eaten ; while a heap of broken bottles filled the whole left hand corner of the cellar , and a tun , the cock of which was left running , was yielding , by this means , the last drop of its blood .: 79.42
<S> this winding sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric , which the young girl had bought a fortnight before .: 42.03
<S> as to the left hand one , he conscientiously repeated the same signals , which were finally transmitted to the minister of the interior .: 44.07
<S> d artagnan does not tell you , raoul , said athos , in his turn , that he was reckoned one of the finest swordsmen of his time a knuckle of iron , a wrist of steel , a sure eye and a glance of fire ; that s what his adversary met with .: 43.87
<S> you asked me just now if i was in funds , said d artagnan , placing some twenty pistoles upon the table .: 26.44
<S> she knew she had only two days left ; that when once the order was signed by buckingham and buckingham would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name , and he could not , therefore , recognize the woman in question once this order was signed , we say , the baron would make her embark immediately , and she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose beauty is lighted by the sun of the world , whose style the voice of fashion lauds , and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting splendors .: 110.29
<S> there is nobody within , said bonacieux .: 45.22
<S> it was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man ; and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the prison .: 74.20
<S> oh , sire , what a dreadful misfortune !: 16.61
<S> poverty was repugnant to her ; degradation took away two thirds of her greatness .: 76.22
<S> a hundred pistoles !: 13.60
<S> there , there , said la carconte ; do you hear that ?: 19.28
<S> he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired .: 55.93
<S> i have imparted it to no one but my god , and that in my prayers . i ask for no more .: 35.54
<S> for a man not connected with newspapers , here is the pendant to the famous sea serpent of the constitutionnel . wild eyes , the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure , said debray ; facial angle strongly developed , magnificent forehead , livid complexion , black beard , sharp and white teeth , politeness unexceptionable . just so , lucien , returned morcerf ; you have described him feature for feature .: 128.27
<S> oh , oh , said the brigadier , who thoroughly understood the trick ; a bad sign to find the door open !: 47.74
<S> in the morning , felton came as usual ; but milady allowed him to preside over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to him .: 46.89
<S> danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering , and monte cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features , but which was gone in a moment .: 31.73
<S> bonacieux , with great emotion , in my name i beg you !: 42.72
<S> do you hear that , madame ?: 13.28
<S> was it an entire army ?: 86.72
<S> he gave orders that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared ; but at two o clock she had not returned .: 23.02
<S> where , then , could he be , if he had entered his mother s room and not since returned ?: 41.49
<S> send your saddle , then , to the ho tel of the musketeers , and your horse can be brought back with ours . very well ; but it is already five o clock , so make haste . a quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue fe rou on a very handsome genet .: 23.60
<S> but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature , concentrated and insensible by force of austerity .: 63.71
<S> the cardinal , who sometimes became weary of the king , granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant , who promised to return about the fifteenth of september .: 62.21
<S> whereupon grimaud , observing the duke s disappointment , drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him .: 30.00
<S> free without my aid !: 198.66
<S> merce de s , i must revenge myself , for i suffered fourteen years , fourteen years i wept , i cursed ; now i tell you , merce de s , i must revenge myself . the count , fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved , called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred .: 33.16
<S> in that case , commanded comminges , silence that old woman . ah !: 51.68
<S> he was in bed , but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war .: 30.03
<S> albert rose to return to his place .: 24.91
<S> information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation project gutenberg depends upon and can not survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment .: 31.24
<S> here was another frondeuse to persuade , and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival .: 191.25
<S> and we did not surrender no !: 70.29
<S> to all the simple things which escaped our gascon , milady replied with a smile of kindness .: 50.69
<S> but m. de la tre mouille already prejudiced by his esquire , whose relative , as we already know , bernajoux was replied that it was neither for m. de tre ville nor the musketeers to complain , but , on the contrary , for him , whose people the musketeers had assaulted and whose ho tel they had endeavored to burn .: 47.63
<S> when the wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the rue des fossoyeurs that is to say , when the forty pistoles of king louis xiii .: 33.88
<S> one thing only perplexed edmond , and destroyed his theory .: 122.62
<S> yes ; but it is not a horse for hard work . you are mistaken ; i rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour and a half , and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made the tour of the place st. sulpice . ah , you begin to awaken my regret . regret ? yes ; i have parted with him . how ? why , here is the simple fact .: 38.72
<S> have you a letter of audience ? asked a porter , advancing to the new arrival .: 37.81
<S> do you not recognize me , unhappy child ? silence , be silent ! said andrea , who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls ; for heaven s sake , do not speak so loud ! you wish to speak with me alone , do you not ? said bertuccio .: 28.08
<S> do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at jussac ? and those two equally fine thrusts at bernajoux . truly ! without reckoning , said athos , that if he had not rescued me from the hands of cahusac , i should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to your majesty . why he is a very devil , this be arnais !: 46.77
<S> dante s said , i wish to die , and had chosen the manner of his death , and fearful of changing his mind , he had taken an oath to die .: 29.96
<S> i have killed two , which has made people hold their tongues , but has not made me their friend .: 65.55
<S> i believe everything , said athos , biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid sighing .: 34.99
<S> the latter obeyed without reply , and entered the chamber , where he appeared to be expected .: 19.82
<S> planchet obtained from rochefort the rank of sergeant in the piedmont regiment .: 170.03
<S> as quick as thought , he tore open the letter , in spite of the cry which kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do , or rather , what he was doing .: 37.37
<S> you suppose that i would ever accept the price of your life ?: 41.71
<S> but where the devil were you gadding last night , my young master ?: 45.00
<S> you do not answer , madame ! exclaimed the terrible interrogator .: 26.02
<S> is the committee willing to hear this witness ? yes , yes , they all said at once .: 53.91
<S> but formerly it appears , began mousqueton timidly .: 131.50
<S> this is not the ho tel des princes . come , you are growing discontented , you are no longer happy ; you , who only wish to live like a retired baker . caderousse sighed .: 29.81
<S> this , he said to planchet , must be the archbishop s chateau , the abode of the fair madame de longueville ; but the convent , where is that ? the convent , your honor , is at the other end of the village ; i know it well . well , then , planchet , gallop up to it whilst i tighten my horse s girth , and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the jesuits windows . in about five minutes planchet returned .: 42.46
<S> we are not on duty , and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we pleased .: 50.51
<S> i say that he has hastily accused your majesty s musketeers , toward whom he is unjust , and that he has not obtained his information from good sources . the accusation comes from monsieur de la tre mouille , from the duke himself .: 43.84
<S> nobody knew .: 130.22
<S> does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing ? asked monte cristo .: 63.20
<S> send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of monsieur de chavigny ; we ll have a supper here under your direction . hum ! said la ramee .: 33.80
<S> as he passed the table on which the axe was laid , he stopped , and turning with a smile , said : ah !: 26.64
<S> tell them yourself that i was taken by bandits , and that without your generous intercession i should now have been sleeping in the catacombs of st. sebastian , instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the rue du helder . ah , said monte cristo you promised me never to mention that circumstance . it was not i who made that promise , cried morcerf ; it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner , and whom you have forgotten .: 34.54
<S> julie trembled at this request , which seemed to her of bad omen .: 69.28
<S> the barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long , thick and black hair and beard , which gave his head the appearance of one of titian s portraits .: 47.67
<S> we have the first throw . ha !: 37.95
<S> all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert .: 35.85
<S> during this time the abbe had chosen his place for listening at his ease .: 31.89
<S> bonacieux , sorrowfully .: 33.66
<S> charlotte backson , comtesse de la fe re , milady de winter , said he , your crimes have wearied men on earth and god in heaven .: 54.90
<S> i must seem to you by no means curious , but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so long it will happen one day or the other . 20083m and do you propose to make this journey very shortly ? i do not know ; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements . i should like to be there at the time you come , and i will endeavor to repay you , as far as lies in my power , for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at monte cristo . i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure , replied the host , but , unfortunately , if i go there , it will be , in all probability , incognito . the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz , for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice .: 53.31
<S> and now , gentlemen , that s well , continued the cardinal .: 8.91
<S> three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear .: 124.45
<S> who knows ?: 45.37
<S> bertuccio left .: 115.43
<S> the host opened .: 34.90
<S> as for porthos , i believe him to be eternal , like god , although less patient .: 49.02
<S> athos made him a sign to come with them .: 14.17
<S> you are too charming , said d artagnan , sorrowfully ; and you abuse my love . no , i use your generosity , that s all .: 24.60
<S> men of the robe and men of the sword chapter xvi .: 33.22
<S> i will go straight to the louvre ; i will give in my resignation as captain of the king s musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal s guards , and if he refuses me , morbleu ! i will turn abbe . at these words , the murmur without became an explosion ; nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphemies .: 41.70
<S> albert de morcerf is no coward ! said monte cristo .: 21.87
<S> the dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades , and i have heard nothing of either of them since .: 36.90
<S> i , too , said the young man , am a musician at least , my masters used to tell me so ; but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other , and a soprano less than any . danglars smiled , and seemed to say , it is of no consequence . then , hoping doubtless to effect his purpose , he said , the prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday .: 51.61
<S> besides , porthos can not owe you much . how , not much !: 65.15
<S> down there , you always had little presents and christmas boxes , which you tried to hide from your poor friend caderousse .: 130.31
<S> these two men were the executioner s assistants .: 24.20
<S> but besides all this , in order that the instrument may not be contested , i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity , therefore , one of my colleagues will help me , and , contrary to custom , will assist in the dictation of the testament .: 45.24
<S> provoked by a complete refusal , she bit her lip and said , then shall i send valentine to you ? the old man closed his eyes eagerly , thereby intimating that such was his wish .: 67.57
<S> but , a propos , resumed m. de tre ville , what has become of your three companions ? i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them ? none , monsieur . well , i left them on my road porthos at chantilly , with a duel on his hands ; aramis at cre vec ur , with a ball in his shoulder ; and athos at amiens , detained by an accusation of coining . see there , now ! said m. de tre ville ; and how the devil did you escape ? by a miracle , monsieur , i must acknowledge , with a sword thrust in my breast , and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais , like a butterfly on a tapestry . there again !: 33.59
<S> then you will start after the queen ? no , said mazarin again .: 28.25
<S> royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the address specified in section 4 , information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation . you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing or by e mail within 30 days of receipt that s he does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg license .: 21.93
<S> i come for your commands , my lord , he said .: 17.44
<S> she will remain at home , read novels , and speculate at cards , since she can no longer do so on the bourse . then taking up his account book , he cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had just paid away .: 69.76
<S> see , said he , my dear friend , how god punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference , by presenting dreadful scenes to their view .: 73.92
<S> and , to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet , the count seemed to have the power of fascination .: 28.61
<S> yes , sir . a whole bottle , if you will drink my health . willingly , answered the soldier .: 33.49
<S> well , la ramee , who is a gourmand , sees his pates , thinks them more attractive than those of pere marteau and proposes to me that i shall try them .: 54.72
<S> in a moment he was on the ground .: 13.05
<S> have you not let it go out of your hands ? no . d avrigny took the bottle , poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand , and swallowed them .: 30.50
<S> come , come , said comminges , who , since d artagnan , on the day of broussel s arrest , had saved him from the hands of the parisians , had entertained a real affection for him , don t be unhappy ; i never thought of bringing you bad news .: 26.21
<S> she turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her .: 26.47
<S> planchet recognized him first .: 61.28
<S> never ! never ! added porthos .: 46.11
<S> your hand , madame , your hand , and i depart ! anne of austria stretched forth her hand , closing her eyes , and leaning with the other upon estafania , for she felt that her strength was about to fail her .: 31.62
<S> then , father , said raoul , forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart , if you are a priest you have an opportunity , as my friend has told you , of exercising your vocation .: 47.13
<S> three companies presented themselves , each offering equal securities .: 232.99
<S> the scotchman .: 46.19
<S> the hangings were of damask , the carpets from alencon , and the bed , especially , had more the look of a fine lady s couch , with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane , than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain heaven by fasting and mortification .: 57.12
<S> take advantage of all , and live happily and long .: 47.17
<S> i do what i please , m. beauchamp , and it is always well done . sir , replied the young man , honest men are not to be paid with such coin .: 25.23
<S> i see you to tell you that everything separates us the depths of the sea , the enmity of kingdoms , the sanctity of vows .: 45.90
<S> let them come on !: 22.46
<S> let us shut this one up . they put the stone back in its place ; the abbe sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed , rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other , and then , going towards his bed , he removed it from the spot it stood in .: 68.25
<S> as hope , however , is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man , he finished by hoping that he might survive , even though with terrible wounds , in both these duels ; and in case of surviving , he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct : what a madcap i was , and what a stupid fellow i am !: 100.16
<S> yes . and who is it ? said porthos .: 10.22
<S> m. de villefort , notwithstanding his self control , was visibly affected , and when monte cristo touched his hand , he felt it tremble .: 21.66
<S> bazin was their only attendant , for grimaud had stayed behind to take care of mousqueton .: 82.53
<S> the office of the king s attorney chapter 68 .: 12.20
<S> there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls .: 92.73
<S> remember , if you talk , if you babble , if you get drunk , you risk your master s head , who has so much confidence in your fidelity , and who answers for you .: 35.69
<S> the count of monte cristo is unquestionably a man of first rate breeding and knowledge of the world . then you accept his offer ? said the host .: 32.39
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> go to the devil !: 18.12
<S> and you think that your wife has returned to the louvre . without speaking to anyone but yourself ? i am sure of it . that is an important point , do you understand ? then the news i brought you is of value ? the greatest , my dear bonacieux ; i don t conceal this from you . then the cardinal will be pleased with me ? i have no doubt of it . the great cardinal ! are you sure , in her conversation with you , that your wife mentioned no names ? i think not . she did not name madame de chevreuse , the duke of buckingham , or madame de vernet ? no ; she only told me she wished to send me to london to serve the interests of an illustrious personage . the traitor ! murmured mme .: 37.53
<S> you will give your name to the captain , who will bring you to me .: 15.95
<S> i have always had more dread of a pen , a bottle of ink , and a sheet of paper , than of a sword or pistol . the fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be , said danglars .: 40.76
<S> revolt !: 62.73
<S> what has become of him ? i shouldn t wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very moment .: 18.98
<S> during this time valentine , at once terrified and happy , after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable , asked leave to retire to her own room , in order to recover her composure .: 65.80
<S> on hearing the password , germain bowed .: 52.66
<S> it is long since we have had a good dinner ; and i , for my part , have a somewhat hazardous expedition for this evening , and shall not be sorry , i confess , to fortify myself with a few glasses of good old burgundy . agreed , as to the old burgundy ; i have no objection to that , said aramis , from whom the letter and the gold had removed , as by magic , his ideas of conversion .: 43.28
<S> the office of the king s attorney let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed , and follow madame danglars in her morning excursion .: 60.88
<S> as the marquis had promised , villefort found the marquise and rene e in waiting .: 59.98
<S> a surgeon ! cried m. de tre ville , mine !: 14.33
<S> and are the first of men ! added d artagnan .: 28.31
<S> then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit .: 51.22
<S> the people were in an excited mood , but , like a swarm of frightened bees , seemed not to know at what point to concentrate ; and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing .: 63.55
<S> ali , is the supper ready ? at this moment the tapestry moved aside , and a nubian , black as ebony , and dressed in a plain white tunic , made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining room .: 45.40
<S> oh , yes !: 8.91
<S> the chocolate was inoffensive , for m. de villefort felt no effects .: 43.10
<S> trust me , don t let us try to do things cheaply .: 36.48
<S> mousqueton was seasick .: 50.00
<S> and what did the officers do ? four conveyed him away , i don t know where to the bastille or fort l eve que .: 46.12
<S> but you tell me he is no more , and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge , so let all such feeling be buried with him . you prefer , then , said the abbe , that i should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous , the reward intended for faithful friendship ? that is true enough , returned caderousse .: 51.31
<S> so that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner ! said danglars .: 148.98
<S> but no , his heart is beating .: 45.99
<S> your life is devoted from this moment , and does not belong to you .: 24.68
<S> monsieur d herblay , she added , turning toward aramis , will you be my servant once more this evening ? how can you doubt it ? replied aramis ; this evening , to morrow , always ; command me . i will , then .: 38.79
<S> because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape . ah !: 71.69
<S> the prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey .: 38.33
<S> it soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise within a timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard .: 41.20
<S> is it not so , madame ? oh , my god , my god ! murmured the queen , whose teeth chattered with fright .: 10.22
<S> the young woman hastened to meet him .: 17.63
<S> belay . this order was also executed ; and the vessel passed , as dante s had predicted , twenty fathoms to windward .: 102.95
<S> in proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations ; so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing , announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent experienced .: 148.24
<S> albert could not see the face of the countess , as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head , and which fell over her features in misty folds , but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered .: 35.09
<S> the chancellor sequier , who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly , stood before her , relating how his carriage had been smashed , how he had been pursued and had rushed into the hotel d o , that the hotel was immediately invaded , pillaged and devastated ; happily he had time to reach a closet hidden behind tapestry , in which he was secreted by an old woman , together with his brother , the bishop of meaux .: 78.87
<S> he has put out the lamp , i can see nothing now . get down then and quickly . grimaud leaped down .: 62.59
<S> ten days passed away thus .: 33.73
<S> great heavens ? suddenly exclaimed debray .: 102.45
<S> about fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of cromwell s cuirassiers .: 63.48
<S> love me too ; i will not torment you much , but only on condition that you become a frondist , my young friend , and a hearty frondist , too . but can i continue to visit madame de chevreuse ? i should say you could !: 47.38
<S> it would be a curious idea , and maybe i should find my friend under the name of achilles .: 35.27
<S> it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspector s voice called him to the visiting room .: 38.27
<S> during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state , valentine s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes , and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted .: 73.63
<S> you bring me down to your own level , and demand explanations !: 69.51
<S> are you quite alone ? inquired the guest , as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass .: 38.09
<S> that is useless . yes , yes !: 17.78
<S> yet the great sometimes repent of their ingratitude . in that case it would be quite another thing .: 61.86
<S> then i saw no more ; but i heard the noise of breaking furniture .: 34.86
<S> the latter made a sign , and when the carriages had drawn close together , said : you are going to madame de morcerf s , are you not ? no , replied madame danglars , i am too ill. you are wrong , replied villefort , significantly ; it is important that you should be seen there . do you think so ? asked the baroness .: 18.50
<S> thanks to the spurs , which served as stirrups , in a moment we were perched upon the croupe ; we were well placed and saw everything .: 75.83
<S> the count understood him .: 19.59
<S> really , sir , he observed , i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man , you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society , beginning with man , and ending with man that is to say , in the most restricted , most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace . pray , sir , explain yourself , said villefort , more and more astonished , i really do not understand you perfectly . i say , sir , that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations , you see only the springs of the machine , and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act ; i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king ; and that the men whom god has put above those office holders , ministers , and kings , by giving them a mission to follow out , instead of a post to fill i say that they escape your narrow , limited field of observation .: 83.73
<S> that is impossible , replied the governor .: 11.41
<S> that door is guarded , d artagnan ; you know that . very well , you will force it , said porthos .: 23.13
<S> indeed , count , you are the most polished man in the world .: 21.51
<S> bazin was stationed in the corridor , and barred his passage with the more intrepidity that , after many years of trial , bazin found himself near a result of which he had ever been ambitious .: 49.89
<S> as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door , and there was no address given , the party all separated ; cha teau renaud , albert , and morrel , went one way , and debray and beauchamp the other .: 54.35
<S> maximilian villefort rose , half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief .: 48.57
<S> zounds !: 34.39
<S> we keep him in the cellar !: 38.99
<S> through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening , then a second ; the window turned on its hinges , and a man entered .: 45.32
<S> her dress , which was that of the women of epirus , consisted of a pair of white satin trousers , embroidered with pink roses , displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair , that they might well have been taken for parian marble , had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes , beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls .: 76.04
<S> then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables .: 122.07
<S> he immediately fell backward .: 63.89
<S> he committed a crime , it is true ; but he repented of it . and the four friends quit the room , leaving to planchet and fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to brisemont .: 93.13
<S> at the first word the cardinal spoke of mme .: 15.31
<S> because , answered the gascon , we were sent , porthos and i , by cardinal mazarin to fight for cromwell ; instead of fighting for cromwell we have served charles i. not the same thing by any means .: 59.79
<S> monsieur , returned maximilian , raising the glass cover , and respectfully kissing the silken purse , this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide , us from ruin , and our name from shame and disgrace , a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor children , doomed to want and wretchedness , can at present hear everyone envying our happy lot .: 127.20
<S> monte cristo carried them both to the salon , and deposited them on a sofa .: 27.77
<S> we can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves , when you watch so carefully over others .: 111.08
<S> besides , although you suffer much , you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before . do not mistake !: 44.02
<S> not another step , he said , or you are a dead man . what , then , said vampa , raising his hand with a gesture of disdain , while teresa , no longer able to restrain her alarm , clung closely to him , do wolves rend each other ? who are you ? inquired the sentinel .: 30.07
<S> the accused replied that his name was jacques michel bonacieux , that he was fifty one years old , a retired mercer , and lived rue des fossoyeurs , no .: 92.86
<S> all hands to the pumps ! i shouted ; but it was too late , and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in .: 106.13
<S> porthos linked his arm in that of his friend .: 33.79
<S> when they met they looked desolately at one another , as much as to say , have you found anything ? however , as porthos had first found an idea , and had thought of it earnestly afterward , he was the first to act .: 55.75
<S> really , that demoiselle d aubigne is very charming ! so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping room ; and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished .: 62.65
<S> my friends , said athos , this is what i expected from such hearts as yours .: 24.91
<S> jesus seigneur .: 19.96
<S> this time he could not blame dante s .: 22.67
<S> you were seated upon cushions in the spanish fashion ; you wore a robe of green satin embroidered with gold and silver , hanging sleeves knotted upon your beautiful arms those lovely arms with large diamonds .: 85.92
<S> you must take a carriage and an escort , and guard the prisoner with the greatest care . d artagnan took the letter , touched his hat with his hand , turned round upon his heel like a drill sergeant , and a moment afterward was heard , in his dry and monotonous tone , commanding four men and an escort , a carriage and a horse . five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard .: 44.20
<S> why , you must see , your excellency , cried the steward , that this is not natural ; that , having a house to purchase , you purchase it exactly at auteuil , and that , purchasing it at auteuil , this house should be no .: 35.69
<S> all this is very sad which you tell me . what will you ?: 32.71
<S> the baron adored count andrea cavalcanti ; not so mademoiselle euge nie danglars .: 74.25
<S> valentine hid her head between her hands .: 32.27
<S> can it , gentlemen ? added the young man , turning to the two guards , whom he introduced to his friends .: 19.72
<S> madame de villefort closed the door carefully after the child , the count appearing not to notice her ; then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber , the young wife returned to her chair , in which she seated herself .: 32.40
<S> on arriving at the hotel de bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers , who seemed to know every possible password ; for they walked without either guide or escort , and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them , who instantly let them pass with evident deference , due probably to their high birth .: 68.93
<S> nevertheless , he continued , in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice , i think it is better not to make them . then , said raoul , this monsieur scarron is a poet ? yes ; you are warned , vicomte .: 39.95
<S> but instead of obeying him , the servants stood watching m. d avrigny , who ran to valentine , and raised her in his arms .: 31.02
<S> don t let him escape ! said a loud voice .: 17.15
<S> the moon , which was partially obscured by heavy clouds , now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels , or silvered the walls , the roofs , and the spires of the town that charles i. had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops , whilst oxford and newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement .: 82.58
<S> he then , with noiseless haste , took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening , saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchen garden , opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road , shut it after him , and d artagnan saw him pass by like a dart , bending , as he went , beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia .: 60.68
<S> he was the man who had proposed to carlini the health of their chief , and to whom carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face .: 49.85
<S> i thank you , gentlemen , said he , for having complied with my request ; i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship . morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached , and remained at a short distance .: 34.59
<S> mousqueton also attracted attention ; and as the romance of don quixote was then the fashion , they said that he was sancho , who , after having lost one master , had found two .: 76.55
<S> she becomes at once a queen and a wife , and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently .: 52.44
<S> oh , leave me ! said i .: 18.21
<S> try , porthos , to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our windows .: 49.05
<S> it anticipates , through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate , measures to be taken after the events .: 140.97
<S> do you go , and i will stay and take care of the wounded man . and give up your share of the venture , said edmond , to remain with me ? yes , said jacopo , and without any hesitation . you are a good fellow and a kind hearted messmate , replied edmond , and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions ; but i do not wish anyone to stay with me .: 34.45
<S> take away vasiliki ! said my father to his palikares .: 96.00
<S> it is the face of the count of monte cristo ! exclaimed the procureur , with a haggard expression .: 12.29
<S> give me a light . shall i accompany you , monsieur ? no , it is unnecessary ; bertuccio will show me a light . and monte cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces , which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge .: 38.55
<S> as she was coming down , she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople , and in whom my father placed so much confidence ; for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous .: 40.59
<S> here and there on the walls of the staircase , were reflected gigantic shadows , which trembled in the flickering light of the pine torches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above .: 102.49
<S> monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand , which she as usual raised to her lips .: 29.54
<S> the three friends looked on , panting and astonished .: 22.39
<S> i am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer .: 59.00
<S> when once more in her own apartment anne fell into a chair and wept ; then suddenly struck with an idea : i am saved ! she exclaimed , rising ; oh , yes !: 49.33
<S> the pale light of the first rays of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression .: 60.81
<S> are you strong ? the abbe asked one day of dante s .: 34.30
<S> the weapon , as we have already stated , was plunged into the body to the hilt , and as the surgeon , taking it by the end , drew it forth , the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful .: 37.75
<S> people cry out , long live the king !: 98.26
<S> aramis started back and drew his .: 63.97
<S> he told how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion , and how , not seeing her come , he had climbed the linden tree , and by the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the chamber .: 47.12
<S> i don t know such a place . and that name of a town or village is written in her hand ! cried athos .: 43.33
<S> let us be open with each other and sincere . what ! cried the gascon , do you think , athos , we can take leave , calmly , of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and aramis ? no , answered athos ; embrace me , my son . zounds ! said porthos , sobbing , i believe i m crying ; but how foolish all this is ! then they embraced .: 50.80
<S> yes . very well .: 18.21
<S> d artagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side .: 68.78
<S> but that s quite enough , gentlemen ; please to understand , that s enough .: 54.97
<S> edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along ; his leg was inert , and he could no longer make use of one arm .: 50.80
<S> insensibly my eyelids grew heavy , deep sleep stole over me , and having no suspicion of anything wrong , i sought not to shake it off .: 96.80
<S> the old man appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the abbe busoni , who looked cold and calm , as usual .: 41.03
<S> i saw her at the theatre , and heard her one morning when i breakfasted with the count . he eats , then ? yes ; but so little , it can hardly be called eating . he must be a vampire . laugh , if you will ; the countess g , who knew lord ruthven , declared that the count was a vampire . ah , capital , said beauchamp .: 47.12
<S> but in this world we must risk something .: 58.39
<S> why , replied athos , carelessly , she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned musketeer , named athos , has taken her safe conduct from her by force ; she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends , aramis and porthos , at the same time .: 41.56
<S> it is enough .: 19.64
<S> where are you ? asked the valet de chambre , whose eyes , dazzled by the light , could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom .: 25.03
<S> oh , you are a man of god , sir , cried caderousse ; for no one knew that edmond had given you this diamond , and you might have kept it . which , said the abbe to himself , you would have done . the abbe rose , took his hat and gloves .: 19.77
<S> but what can i do with you ?: 8.65
<S> ready , said he , with his usual curtness .: 21.53
<S> vampa measured the distance ; the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him , and there was not a chance of overtaking him .: 23.65
<S> more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother , and she would not have hesitated a moment , if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de cha teau renaud ; but morrel was of plebeian extraction , and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saint me ran despised all who were not noble .: 58.53
<S> but raoul ? said aramis .: 22.80
<S> forward ! cried d artagnan , driven to extremities , biting his moustache ; and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear .: 56.93
<S> i will look at it again ; and he read the paragraph for the third time , laying a stress on each word as he proceeded .: 42.76
<S> you are in a shocking hurry to be off you forget one of my guests .: 43.39
<S> d artagnan was too grand to promise anything ; he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name .: 50.40
<S> do you understand that , my dear franz no horses ? he said , but can t we have post horses ? they have been all hired this fortnight , and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting . what are we to say to this ? asked franz .: 64.30
<S> why did you leave the closet , monsieur d artagnan ? asked the cardinal .: 10.63
<S> come now , do smile , instead of looking at me so solemnly .: 76.27
<S> it is all one to us to us who do not command to morrow s expedition . chatillon and flamarens looked at each other .: 53.00
<S> yes , here it is . who is this athos ? one of my friends . but if he should be at home and see me ? he is not at home , and i will carry away the key , after having placed you in his apartment . but if he should return ? oh , he won t return ; and if he should , he will be told that i have brought a woman with me , and that woman is in his apartment . but that will compromise me sadly , you know . of what consequence ?: 27.99
<S> he remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons .: 36.90
<S> it is not monsieur porthos that your lordship means ? yes , that is my companion s name .: 29.18
<S> when ? to morrow evening , if you like ! at what hour ? at ten in the evening , if that suits you ; by that time we shall have returned . good . there , continued athos , either peace or war will be decided ; honor , at all events , will be maintained ! alas ! murmured d artagnan , our honor as soldiers is lost to us forever ! d artagnan , said athos , gravely , i assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so upon that .: 63.76
<S> was i not nearly your husband ? 50056m and with this raillery andrea went out , leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame , and to the comments of the crowd .: 59.68
<S> he jumped out of bed and ran to the window .: 13.02
<S> the steps were already down and the door open .: 28.02
<S> what have you to say in your defense ? asked bradshaw of the king .: 23.28
<S> m. de villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death .: 18.82
<S> one only needs to be sharp , that s all .: 42.21
<S> do you understand me ? he said .: 7.45
<S> no one could be seen or heard .: 20.26
<S> they then determined to depart .: 29.06
<S> he then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground .: 15.75
<S> the marquis de saint me ran , one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of louis xviii .: 20.41
<S> dante s is my friend , and i won t have him ill used . and who thinks of using him ill ?: 61.99
<S> at length he met a belated passenger , went up to him , and spoke a few words to him .: 20.58
<S> here edmond was to undergo another trial ; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself , as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years .: 36.62
<S> oh , do not give me credit for this , madame ; it was done by the romans , who much esteemed them , and pliny relates that they sent slaves from ostia to rome , who carried on their heads fish which he calls the mulus , and which , from the description , must probably be the goldfish .: 58.40
<S> never !: 43.48
<S> it was a mixed mass of blue , red , and gold .: 29.26
<S> they expected to hear some mention made of d artagnan or of porthos , but every one was engrossed by articles and reforms .: 91.92
<S> i know he can not save my life , but he may strengthen me to give my evidence . against whom ? against my murderer . did you recognize him ? yes ; it was benedetto . the young corsican ? himself . your comrade ? yes .: 45.82
<S> have you really met with some great misfortune ? oh , no , monsieur , said villefort with a bitter smile ; it is only a loss of money which i have sustained nothing worth mentioning , i assure you . true , said monte cristo , the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess , and to one of your philosophic spirit . it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me , said villefort , though , after all , 900,000 francs are worth regretting ; but i am the more annoyed with this fate , chance , or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune , and may blast the prospects of my child also , as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood . 30183m what do you say ? said the count ; 900,000 francs ?: 47.65
<S> the old servant came .: 43.50
<S> save me , gentlemen , for the love of heaven , save me ! cried he .: 18.97
<S> meanwhile , danglars , stooping to monte cristo s ear , your advice was excellent , said he ; there is a whole history connected with the names fernand and yanina . indeed ? said monte cristo .: 42.35
<S> halloo !: 28.51
<S> the sight of albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on merce de s ; she pressed her son s hand and sobbed aloud , but her tears relieved her .: 39.99
<S> you carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself ? no ; i do not wish to come between a father and son .: 45.48
<S> did you forget that this great man , this hero , this demigod , is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death , prurigo ? and , moreover , my dear duke , continued the minister of police , we are almost assured that , in a very short time , the usurper will be insane . insane ? raving mad ; his head becomes weaker .: 63.28
<S> besides , he is almost mad now , and in another year he will be quite so . so much the better for him , he will suffer less , said the inspector .: 22.63
<S> i am captain dante s , a loyal frenchman , thought accused of treason ; tell me where you are conducting me , and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate . the gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion , who returned for answer a sign that said , i see no great harm in telling him now , and the gendarme replied : you are a native of marseilles , and a sailor , and yet you do not know where you are going ? on my honor , i have no idea . have you no idea whatever ? none at all . that is impossible . i swear to you it is true .: 38.73
<S> as he , however , had no other hat , he picked up this as he ran , and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath .: 55.76
<S> grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring .: 30.59
<S> what are you doing ? cried kitty .: 9.62
<S> but let us wait a little and reflect .: 34.41
<S> it was that of a number of men steadily approaching .: 39.11
<S> bonacieux ; you will ruin us all ! but i have sworn to kill that man ! said d artagnan .: 31.76
<S> save your skin ; begone quickly . d artagnan did not budge .: 68.34
<S> you are silent ?: 40.74
<S> here i am at your eminence s service , as well as monsieur du vallon , one of my old friends , who used to conceal his nobility under the name of porthos . porthos bowed to the cardinal .: 20.41
<S> an officer approached .: 41.68
<S> anne of austria sought to read in mazarin s face the occasion of this unexpected visit , since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired .: 82.32
<S> why , the good god sends him back again . caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair .: 40.80
<S> his three companions joined him .: 24.02
<S> we have a king ten years old , who doesn t yet know what he wants ; we have a queen blinded by a belated passion ; we have a minister who governs france as he would govern a great farm that is to say , intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of italian cunning and invention ; we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition , who will draw from mazarin s hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes .: 98.30
<S> you are abused , sir ; but that is not the question .: 16.07
<S> when you arrived , madame de saint me ran had already been panting for breath some minutes ; she then had a fit , which i took to be simply a nervous attack , and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed , and her limbs and neck appear stiffened , that i became really alarmed .: 71.97
<S> we must proceed in an orderly manner . hush ! said grimaud , he is coming out .: 30.35
<S> keep your journey a secret ; do not boast of what you have come to paris to do , or have done ; return with all speed ; enter marseilles at night , and your house by the back door , and there remain , quiet , submissive , secret , and , above all , inoffensive ; for this time , i swear to you , we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies .: 66.77
<S> he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat , and saw that they were no larger than buckshot .: 62.68
<S> poor fellow , poor fellow ! murmured caderousse .: 32.86
<S> you wish me , then , to relate the history of my past sorrows ? said she .: 18.92
<S> her elbows were placed upon a mean table , and she leaned her head upon her two hands , which were white as ivory .: 32.00
<S> then he said to himself : i must put this to the test , but without compromising anybody .: 37.35
<S> see , my lord , said he , in a deep , gloomy tone , here is a woman who was under my guard , and who has killed herself ! be at ease , felton , said lord de winter .: 20.80
<S> yes ; i am a supercargo ; pen , ink , and paper are my tools , and without my tools i am fit for nothing . pen , ink , and paper , then , called fernand loudly .: 38.12
<S> but having sinned myself , it may be more deeply than others , i never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures , and found out their weaknesses .: 63.84
<S> that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them .: 67.85
<S> the queen then gave her orders , spoke of a banquet which the marquis de villequier was to give to her on the day after the morrow , indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of it , announced another visit on the following day to val de grace , where she intended to pay her devotions , and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her .: 57.40
<S> it is to be to morrow , said aramis hastily .: 30.47
<S> that s a daring rascal , whispered the count .: 27.77
<S> my children , he said , this is the marechal de la meilleraie , as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself , on returning to the louvre , to demand of the queen , in your name , our broussel s release .: 39.90
<S> my faith , said d artagnan to athos , you had a triumphant idea !: 23.34
<S> and as the man approached , d artagnan , in order to have more freedom for his actions , leaned half out of the door ; his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant , which were lighted up by a lantern .: 28.84
<S> d artagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart .: 21.56
<S> the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness ; but in spite of himself , his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to milady s chamber .: 64.67
<S> i tremble to give my permission . listen , valentine .: 68.59
<S> when i presented myself before you for the first time in london , it was to ask you what had become of my fortune ; the second time it was to demand who had sullied my name ; and this time i come before you to ask a question far more terrible than any other , to say to you as god said to the first murderer : cain , what hast thou done to thy brother abel ? my lord , what have you done with your sister your sister , who was my mother ? de winter shrank back from the fire of those scorching eyes .: 49.80
<S> when i was at rogliano everything went on properly , but no sooner was my back turned than benedetto became master , and everything went ill .: 159.47
<S> now , as a quarter past one has already struck , i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying , that , in another hour and thirty minutes merce de s will have become madame dante s. 0069m fernand closed his eyes , a burning sensation passed across his brow , and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair ; but in spite of all his efforts , he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan , which , however , was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company .: 46.69
<S> a short gallop brought them to the road of chaillot ; the day began to decline , carriages were passing and repassing .: 52.57
<S> and now , said morrel , leave me alone , and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away . will you not see my sister once more ? asked maximilian .: 25.62
<S> i was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair . it was i , said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance ; and it was time , for you were sinking . yes , returned dante s , holding out his hand , i thank you again . i almost hesitated , though , replied the sailor ; you looked more like a brigand than an honest man , with your beard six inches , and your hair a foot long . dante s recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the cha teau d if .: 45.05
<S> what unforseen events might not open his prison door , and restore him to liberty ?: 138.11
<S> but hush , here comes our minister of justice ; he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin , and the three young men drew near to listen .: 59.74
<S> so they made this song about her : laboissiere , dis moi . you know it , don t you ? no , sing it , please . aramis immediately complied , and sang the song in a very lively manner .: 85.94
<S> the circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act promptly . still ! said the queen .: 34.61
<S> i told him i would attend to the prisoners in his absence .: 30.27
<S> now , as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time , each becoming , naturally , more firm in his own opinion , m. de tre ville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly .: 63.92
<S> another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back , and as the tutor had already turned his horse s head , they both spurred forward , raoul crying : follow me , olivain ! and the count de guiche : follow , urban and planchet ! and before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest .: 53.81
<S> i gratify my wishes by two means my will and my money .: 93.09
<S> pronounce one single word , muttered d artagnan , and you are a dead man . the coachman perceived at once , by the expression of the man who thus addressed him , that he had fallen into a trap , and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring .: 31.56
<S> then , should anything appear to merit a more minute examination , albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate , similar to that close to the concierge s door , and which merits a particular description .: 71.22
<S> it was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle .: 29.95
<S> thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation .: 64.68
<S> and now , said the queen , we are forgetting one very necessary thing . what is that , madame ? money . mme .: 32.09
<S> in short , you will find your father a very presentable person , i assure you . ah , sir , you have given me confidence ; it is so long since we were separated , that i have not the least remembrance of him , and , besides , you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all defects . he is a millionaire his income is 500,000 francs . then , said the young man , with anxiety , i shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable position . one of the most agreeable possible , my dear sir ; he will allow you an income of 50,000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in paris . then in that case i shall always choose to remain there . you can not control circumstances , my dear sir ; man proposes , and god disposes . andrea sighed .: 34.75
<S> that is a serious thing . monte cristo , who pretended not to be listening , heard however , every word that was said .: 36.14
<S> the prince dismounted , ordered one of his aids and raoul to follow his example , and directed the others to await his orders , keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert .: 39.09
<S> the count took another spoon , and again dipped it into the golden box .: 38.22
<S> i ve a great desire to drink the king s health , said athos .: 25.18
<S> i shall try , in the latter case alas !: 121.98
<S> no ; it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us , but you hypocritically provoked it . i ? yes ; you !: 64.03
<S> no objection was raised , but they pointed out the asylum , which was situated at the upper end of the rue d enfer , and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces , so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child , while the other remained in my possession , i rang the bell , and fled with all speed .: 47.45
<S> i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a year before at the precise spot where i stopped to dig the hole .: 72.07
<S> then , without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention , he asked for his telescope .: 38.32
<S> it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all day .: 50.00
<S> satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions , athos returned to the ho tel , and found planchet impatiently waiting for him .: 45.82
<S> it is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably .: 31.06
<S> in a few minutes he had extracted three boards .: 26.25
<S> it had been resolved the night before to change their encampment .: 56.75
<S> villefort started , madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees , valentine rose , pale and dumb as a statue .: 28.95
<S> m. danglars sold yesterday at 405 , and pockets 300,000 francs .: 101.81
<S> finally , the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same manner ; and the result of the sitting was that the procurator s wife should give eight hundred livres in money , and should furnish the horse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and mousqueton to glory .: 57.61
<S> he listened all was silent , as it had been for the last three days .: 35.65
<S> nothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a thought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization of him who thinks .: 121.35
<S> listen ; i am the only man in the world having the right to say to you , morrel , your father s son shall not die today ; and monte cristo , with an expression of majesty and sublimity , advanced with arms folded toward the young man , who , involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man , recoiled a step .: 40.65
<S> in a month you will find on the table , at which we shall be then sitting , good pistols and a delicious draught ; but , on the other hand , you must promise me not to attempt your life before that time . oh , i also swear it ! monte cristo drew the young man towards him , and pressed him for some time to his heart .: 34.10
<S> taste some of this ham , d artagnan ; it is exquisite , said athos , cutting a slice , which he placed on the young man s plate .: 27.91
<S> by his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barricades .: 112.03
<S> i have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole .: 76.18
<S> he walked down the rue richelieu , meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn , for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of france was not to be thought of , when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to madame de guemenee .: 36.64
<S> see , said she , if everything does not second us !: 58.56
<S> you are accused of treason , of abuse of power , and murder .: 39.94
<S> let us talk like men , he said , looking at the count .: 14.18
<S> take care of your horses ! cried d artagnan to him .: 10.74
<S> oh , my god , my god , have pity on me ! without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of m. bonacieux lamentations to which , besides , they must have been pretty well accustomed the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm , and led him away , while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting .: 50.10
<S> what do you mean ? the album ! i want the album . how dare you tear out the drawings ? oh , it amuses me . go go at once . i won t go unless you give me the album , said the boy , seating himself doggedly in an armchair , according to his habit of never giving way .: 50.16
<S> when one is eating , ideas flow easily .: 198.32
<S> he was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold , to climb those unknown stairs by which , one by one , the old crowns of m. coquenard had ascended .: 130.94
<S> really , count , if ever i thought that i had a friend in the ranks of the royal army , it was you .: 25.23
<S> in the name of heaven , explain yourself ! oh !: 16.36
<S> albert sprang from the porter s lodge to the steps .: 26.25
<S> who comes there ? he cried .: 16.65
<S> sire , resumed tre ville , as i told you , monsieur d artagnan is little more than a boy ; and as he has not the honor of being a musketeer , he was dressed as a citizen .: 18.13
<S> but what can i do for you ? then d artagnan told m. de tre ville a long history about the queen .: 24.57
<S> i never heard you mentioned , and i did not dare inquire for you .: 19.82
<S> i think it does indeed ! cried the gascon , who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court .: 54.95
<S> after he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle field , the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself .: 57.24
<S> well ? she said at length , do you not answer me ? i have but one question to ask you , what do you intend to do ? i was going to ask you , replied the baroness with a beating heart .: 17.41
<S> those who took me from my father , and who always intended , sooner or later , to sell me again to my original proprietor , as they have now done , calculated that , in order to make the most of their bargain , it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth , and even to increase the value , if possible .: 59.30
<S> the young man felt her press his hand , and comprehended that this was a sentiment , not of coquetry , but of gratitude because of his departure .: 42.97
<S> he told me he knew nothing about the matter , that the orders i had received did not come from him , and that if i had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged .: 33.88
<S> no , no , you do yourselves injustice ; but i am here to do you justice .: 27.79
<S> i believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband . but , monsieur , you know then i know that you have been abducted , madame . and by whom ?: 31.10
<S> you will ruin both yourself and me by your folly . how so ? said andrea .: 28.91
<S> none can fly from a dungeon who can not walk . well , we will wait , a week , a month , two months , if need be , and meanwhile your strength will return .: 66.09
<S> i come from the cardinal , said the officer .: 15.64
<S> franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor , and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce .: 141.88
<S> you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing project gutenberg electronic works provided that : you pay a royalty fee of 20 of the gross profits you derive from the use of project gutenberg works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes .: 25.40
<S> we shall soon see how to dispose , he continued , of the parliament !: 49.33
<S> what says augustine on this subject : severus sit clericorum verbo . yes , let the sermon be clear , said the curate .: 108.46
<S> on the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief , and reminded him of his oath .: 36.26
<S> in that case your mother would hold me in aversion , and i do not at all wish that ; on the contrary , i desire to stand high in her esteem . indeed , count , said morcerf , i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me , and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose .: 39.42
<S> i have a very good cook , and he is not to be my heir ; i have full and perfect confidence in him .: 33.54
<S> laugh as much as you will , replied albert , i am in love . you alarm me , cried franz .: 24.17
<S> the breakfast chapter 41 .: 25.65
<S> well ! exclaimed the queen , who remarked this movement and his paleness .: 28.06
<S> he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals , and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned , and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villefort s brow , because they were guilty ; at least , he believed so ; but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed .: 79.16
<S> the hundred days chapter 14 .: 34.71
<S> you may imagine there was something startling and ominous , said hayde e , shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene , in this long file of slaves and women only half aroused from sleep , or at least so they appeared to me , who was myself scarcely awake .: 67.71
<S> but not until two o clock , said d artagnan , with the same calmness .: 17.03
<S> you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman . perhaps so ; and i have an excuse , for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you , i imagine . and the baron pointed , with a slow and accusing gesture , to the left shoulder of milady , which he almost touched with his finger .: 34.66
<S> a man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction .: 90.37
<S> the baroness took advantage of her husband s absence to push open the door of her daughter s study , and m. andrea , who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle euge nie , started up like a jack in the box .: 26.38
<S> from that time he received all who came ; he had an excuse for not eating any more ; the doctor had put him on a diet . the abbe uttered a kind of groan .: 63.10
<S> a doctor ? he was a merchant , monsieur , and had succeeded to the business of my poor father .: 34.70
<S> his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses , worth 32,000 francs , to madame danglars ; his second , the almost miraculous preservation of madame de villefort s life ; now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club .: 62.23
<S> athos did not even turn his head .: 16.63
<S> ah , it is certainly you ! he cried .: 13.90
<S> here are two other cavaliers . as he spoke , two horsemen advanced at full speed .: 40.90
<S> sharpen your sword , baron , load your pistols , and give some corn to the horses , for i will answer for it , something lightning like will happen ere to morrow . but , stop ; do you think it can be a trap that they are laying for us ? suggested porthos , incessantly thinking how his greatness must be irksome to inferior people .: 73.94
<S> he hired the apartment in which he lived furnished , passed only a few hours in the day there , and rarely slept there .: 70.38
<S> there , said la carconte , as she placed a bottle of wine on the table , supper is ready whenever you are . and you ? asked joannes .: 24.86
<S> do you think athos will be sorry to see us ? oh ! cried porthos , oh !: 18.58
<S> we have said that at half past twelve o clock madame danglars had ordered her horses , and had left home in the carriage .: 21.85
<S> who has displeased you ?: 33.42
<S> porthos uttered a deep groan .: 17.79
<S> a capital blow you gave ! cried porthos .: 84.05
<S> no ; its odor charms one of my senses that is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it .: 63.41
<S> ah , ah ! said lord de winter , after having played comedy , after having played tragedy , we are now playing melancholy ? the prisoner made no reply .: 46.66
<S> how did you leave the count ? continued he .: 13.90
<S> in case i am killed , the captain s name is roger and the skiff is called the lightning .: 71.85
<S> a servant entered , summoned by albert s ring of the bell .: 45.30
<S> but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years ; what he did during these ten years , god only knows .: 60.02
<S> he has just left me , replied de winter , after telling me all .: 21.73
<S> then you must know what her name was as a young girl . oh , mon dieu ! cried the executioner , i think i am dying .: 15.51
<S> she seems to have been taken suddenly ill. very probably , answered the count .: 88.89
<S> the abbess listened more attentively , grew animated by degrees , and smiled .: 67.98
<S> if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner , i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting , or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light , especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter .: 52.70
<S> she gave him some slippers , in which he placed his naked feet , and then conducted him down the stairs .: 30.13
<S> our young men had been waiting about half an hour , amid a crowd of courtiers , when all the doors were thrown open , and his majesty was announced .: 31.14
<S> in the name of heaven , sir , cried she , what means all that is passing ?: 19.07
<S> cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed ; he bowed to morcerf , who replied with the most impertinent look possible .: 52.96
<S> all that edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss grown rock .: 71.67
<S> nor was that surprising .: 83.39
<S> emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand , and alarm the house with his cries .: 63.49
<S> diable ! he exclaimed when the door was shut , they seem to have the greatest need of me just now . then , as the half hour had already glided by , he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinal s door .: 34.85
<S> monsieur bertuccio , you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil . bertuccio slightly started .: 48.85
<S> the duke had thrown himself , as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation , on his bed .: 36.12
<S> but all the italians are the same ; they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor . the young man is better , said danglars .: 42.78
<S> he put out his hand to remove the object ; it was a fan which madame de villefort had left in the carriage ; this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning .: 38.79
<S> comminges knocked at the door at the same moment , and friquet was waiting behind comminges until the door should be opened .: 32.15
<S> villefort became pale ; he understood the old man s meaning .: 17.87
<S> the events which have taken place in my house , though they now occupy the public mind , will be forgotten in time , or if , indeed , a few enemies should persist in remembering them , why then i will add them to my list of crimes .: 74.84
<S> on approaching the house , he perceived m. bonacieux in morning costume , standing at his threshold .: 52.23
<S> besides , she had a thousand precautions to take , a thousand counsels to give to her defender , in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before witnesses .: 68.47
<S> the two gentlemen were exasperated ; they had had a long ride , and were dying with hunger and thirst .: 31.67
<S> toward the town of louvres , was the reply .: 40.38
<S> hayde e was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments , which was the drawing room .: 27.01
<S> in the first place , you will sup with me , will you not ? asked aramis .: 9.66
<S> d artagnan , with a sigh , donned his uniform , which he would have exchanged for that of a musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence .: 23.52
<S> his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings , evidently of english manufacture , while from his three cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons .: 144.82
<S> suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth ; the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world .: 57.22
<S> what does this mean ? demanded he of the cardinal .: 15.51
<S> it was aramis .: 13.48
<S> i threw , and i lost . what , my horse ? your horse , seven against eight ; a point short you know the proverb . athos , you are not in your right senses , i swear . my dear lad , that was yesterday , when i was telling you silly stories , it was proper to tell me that , and not this morning .: 65.71
<S> he saw a corpse at his feet .: 15.21
<S> lastly , he had taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near .: 66.85
<S> i may as well blow my brains out , and all will be over . that s the last folly to be committed , said athos , seeing it is the only one for which there is no remedy . but i can never escape , said d artagnan , with such enemies .: 37.87
<S> why does not god , if he really hates the wicked , as he is said to do , send down brimstone and fire , and consume them altogether ? you speak as though you had loved this young dante s , observed the abbe , without taking any notice of his companion s vehemence .: 77.37
<S> what the devil are you doing there ? cried the two friends .: 8.78
<S> at the same time , four of the band , who were concealed on the banks of the almo , surrounded the carriage .: 19.78
<S> suddenly d artagnan touched something warm , which moved .: 106.86
<S> do you wish me to leave ? said morrel , sadly .: 12.96
<S> this horse is decidedly , or rather has been in his youth , a buttercup , resumed the stranger , continuing the remarks he had begun , and addressing himself to his auditors at the window , without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d artagnan , who , however , placed himself between him and them .: 33.70
<S> at midnight , my lord . at midnight , my dear monsieur louvieres . when once more alone gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his house .: 64.68
<S> la ramee stretched out his legs , grimaud took a table cloth , tore it into strips and tied la ramee s feet together .: 55.36
<S> peace with the landlord , in addition to athos s old horse , cost six pistoles .: 78.02
<S> on the honor of a gentleman ; but i can not be imprisoned for the reason alleged ; it is impossible . what reason ? asked d artagnan .: 28.06
<S> i can not swim , and dared not throw myself into the river .: 26.26
<S> but really , my dear count , we are talking as much of women as they do of us ; it is unpardonable . albert rose .: 31.31
<S> as queen catherine used to say , continued she , excited by her own words , rather than give up this infamous broussel to them i will strangle him with my own hands ! and she sprang toward gondy , whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than broussel , with outstretched arms .: 92.85
<S> as to mme .: 15.10
<S> what is to happen ? said porthos .: 12.59
<S> hang it , said groslow , i thought i had succeeded better .: 43.43
<S> i kept in the background , as you wished , and waited , not for the decision of your heart or my own , but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf , and order events in our favor .: 92.07
<S> i do not therefore wish either to kill you , or to be killed myself without a cause .: 43.25
<S> ah , sir , replied caderousse , we can not console those who will not be consoled , and he was one of these ; besides , i know not why , but he seemed to dislike seeing me .: 31.84
<S> mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare , recognized them , and let drop his lantern , uttering a cry of terror .: 46.21
<S> but where you go , i go . they then set off for rueil .: 28.47
<S> but what ? asked the groom .: 12.92
<S> all five , followed by their lackeys leading their horses , took their way to the town of be thune , whose outskirts they perceived , and stopped before the first inn they came to .: 42.69
<S> just what you please ; you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences , or if you like it better you can talk of rome , naples , or florence . oh , said albert , it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses just in the same style as with a parisian ; let me speak to her of the east . do so then , for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste . albert turned towards hayde e .: 59.73
<S> i know them from having heard one of their friends , monsieur d artagnan , say a great deal about them . you know monsieur d artagnan ! cried the novice , in her turn seizing the hands of milady and devouring her with her eyes .: 23.79
<S> that is good to see , said aramis .: 15.19
<S> i thought you were at smyrna . i was ; but am now back again . and where is the dear boy , our little edmond ? why , with his father , no doubt , replied danglars .: 43.16
<S> each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people .: 86.30
<S> on reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men , holding a lantern in his hand .: 25.28
<S> wherefore did you not apply , then , madame , to the first person you saw from us ? such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it . but i heard that a marriage between the prince of wales and mademoiselle d orleans was spoken of , said de winter .: 64.99
<S> athos took the letter from the hands of d artagnan , approached the lamp , set fire to the paper , and did not let go till it was reduced to a cinder .: 33.92
<S> you do not know your own good fortune ! and what would you do , my dear diplomatist , replied morcerf , with a slight degree of irony in his voice , if you did nothing ?: 25.34
<S> one may forsake a mistress , but a wife , good heavens !: 65.17
<S> he could not help thinking of m. rochefort , whom he had seen in notre dame ; could de rochefort have forestalled him with athos ?: 43.79
<S> d artagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking half past eight .: 32.98
<S> you are joking now , replied andrea .: 26.24
<S> good , said he ; it was time , and he sealed his will with three seals .: 42.20
<S> than the son of peter mazarin .: 103.10
<S> the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago , and they have only been employed by me within the last few years .: 63.01
<S> from the former she took some greasy letters , and put in their place the bank notes , and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each , which , in all probability , formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple .: 55.38
<S> have you had another fall at the bourse ? no ; i am safe for a few days at least .: 32.14
<S> write to me at paris , to m. joannes , in the palais royal , arcade pierre , no .: 45.13
<S> it was the king speaking on the scaffold .: 32.71
<S> a procurator s dinner however brilliant had been the part played by porthos in the duel , it had not made him forget the dinner of the procurator s wife .: 53.62
<S> i have not enough , you said , when you had more than you before possessed , and you committed a third crime , without reason , without excuse .: 77.13
<S> the governor then went out , and words of pity fell on dante s listening ears , mingled with brutal laughter .: 126.66
<S> and he made the same friendly salute as d artagnan .: 39.30
<S> noirtier had once made a will against you against your family in favor of the poor , in fact ; m. noirtier is spared , because nothing is expected from him .: 83.95
<S> and having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer the needs of the moment , he placed the others in the ebony box , inlaid with mother of pearl , in which was the famous handkerchief which served him as a talisman .: 76.22
<S> ah ! exclaimed rochefort .: 15.09
<S> ja ! replied the gascon , determined to confine himself to this specimen of the german tongue .: 37.67
<S> the court of saint bernard has its own particular apartment for the reception of guests ; it is a long rectangle , divided by two upright gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners .: 75.01
<S> among some unimportant papers he found the following letter , that which he had sought at the risk of his life : since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the convent , which you should never have allowed her to reach , try , at least , not to miss the man .: 49.86
<S> planchet , prouder than ever of his new duties , deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the place royale with two hundred men , forming the rear of the army of paris , and to march on charenton when necessary .: 43.22
<S> then the pope and c sar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner .: 38.18
<S> there were then , as now , a crowd of young and pretty women who came to st .: 56.91
<S> but , continued morcerf , a propos of danglars , we have strangely wandered from the subject .: 47.38
<S> maximilian goes with me , said the count , in his kindest and most persuasive manner ; therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brother s account . once more farewell , my dear sister ; emmanuel , adieu ! morrel repeated .: 37.97
<S> oh , merciful heavens , was i not accessory to his death by my supine insensibility , by my contempt for him , not remembering , or not willing to remember , that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer ?: 69.40
<S> his only fear was that milady would recognize in him the man of meung and of dover .: 50.29
<S> hurry , hurry ! said andrea , we must overtake him soon . and the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier , and arrived steaming at louvres .: 89.55
<S> what ? this one , too ? he exclaimed .: 37.41
<S> when luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed , he turned towards the wounded man .: 28.05
<S> it was just five o clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear .: 23.52
<S> ah , if you had tasted my life , you would not desire any other , and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there . revenge , for instance ! observed franz .: 50.41
<S> but who told you i was inactive ? but if the plot had succeeded ? i wished it to do so . i thought your excellence considered the death of charles i. as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of england . yes , his death ; but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold . why so ? asked mordaunt .: 65.70
<S> i have promised you the truth ; i will tell it , were it to destroy me . the idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man , did it not ? cried felton .: 34.74
<S> if you are not located in the united states , you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this ebook .: 10.33
<S> he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars , that she might be under the care of his wife .: 24.18
<S> an overpowering sadness took possession of the young man , his hands relaxed their hold , the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color , and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall .: 89.39
<S> now , you understand , my dear monsieur cavalcanti , that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years .: 24.73
<S> thus richard iii. , for instance , was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of edward iv .: 90.40
<S> poor young creature !: 34.23
<S> i am going to prove to you that i have not . good , thought the gascon , this is a promising beginning . monsieur d artagnan , he resumed , do you wish to become a captain ? yes , my lord . and your friend still longs to be made a baron ? at this very moment , my lord , he no doubt dreams that he is one already . then , said mazarin , taking from his portfolio the letter which he had already shown d artagnan , take this dispatch and carry it to england . d artagnan looked at the envelope ; there was no address on it .: 26.31
<S> the officer obeyed .: 18.60
<S> the waking when franz returned to himself , he seemed still to be in a dream .: 28.18
<S> i ? yes , you , said the count , at the same time advancing towards andrea , and slipping a packet of bank notes into the young man s hand .: 17.64
<S> because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity . but if he had escaped ? impossible ; my precautions were taken . and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him ? the four frenchmen , of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by mazarin to me . and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done ? it is possible .: 50.87
<S> yes .: 18.24
<S> why , people jest with death . and people are wrong , d artagnan ; for death is the door which leads to perdition or to salvation . granted ; but if you please , let us not theologize , aramis .: 77.81
<S> it contained half a line , in a hand perfectly british , and with a conciseness as perfectly spartan : thank you ; be easy .: 74.45
<S> in twenty minutes they were at auteuil ; the steward s emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village .: 50.69
<S> oh , sir ! exclaimed he , thank heaven i have arrived in time .: 28.62
<S> this point of union was noirtier , and it was he who had just sent for morrel , with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him a command which morrel obeyed to the letter , to the great discomfiture of barrois .: 50.92
<S> a greek ? murmured the count of morcerf .: 35.12
<S> the prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust .: 19.25
<S> what do you prescribe , doctor ? demanded villefort .: 19.76
<S> the trial .: 41.01
<S> a high wall , at the angle of which was the pavilion , ran along one side of this lane , and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passers by .: 46.70
<S> d artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge him .: 59.10
<S> on landing , the count turned towards the cemetery , where he felt sure of finding morrel .: 35.74
<S> the young men filled up their third of a glass with water ; then , when they had drunk half the glass , they filled it up again , and continued to do so .: 43.04
<S> it was an oriental feast that he offered to them , but of such a kind as the arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare .: 45.68
<S> a porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau ; then the two young girls , having told him to take it to no .: 43.39
<S> make haste , dear lodger , said he ; there is a very pretty girl waiting for you upstairs ; and you know women don t like to be kept waiting . that s kitty ! said d artagnan to himself , and darted into the passage .: 30.68
<S> i never caution my servants a second time remember that . baptistin bowed , and was proceeding towards the door .: 50.26
<S> she then returned to her room , calling for help as loudly as she could , when suddenly her window , which was twenty feet from the ground , was opened , a young peasant jumped into the chamber , seized her in his arms , and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grass plot , where she fainted .: 44.47
<S> he recalled a bit of advice which athos had once given him , and made his horse rear .: 34.48
<S> she was a tall woman , with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls , such as raphael was fond of and titian has painted all his magdalens with .: 73.27
<S> the queen was in the midst of her women mme .: 17.02
<S> no ; for another . for another ? yes . his name ; his name ! cried d artagnan .: 30.30
<S> he was immediately recognized as one of them ; the handkerchief was thrown down , and the iron heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged .: 35.98
<S> i shall take a cutlet on my way to the chamber . do not do anything of the sort ; for were the gentleman a montmorency , and the diplomatist a metternich , we will breakfast at eleven ; in the meantime , follow debray s example , and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit . be it so ; i will stay ; i must do something to distract my thoughts . you are like debray , and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits , the opposition ought to be joyous . ah , you do not know with what i am threatened .: 44.21
<S> and yet what ? asked the abbe .: 12.23
<S> i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when m. de saint me ran advertised it for sale two or three years ago . m .: 48.25
<S> the next day , at the usual hour , the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest .: 11.98
<S> the swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it , by reason of the cold ; but suddenly feebleness , occasioned by loss of blood , obliged him to sit down .: 67.82
<S> it is really wonderful , said the count ; above all , if , as i suppose , it is payable at sight . it is , indeed , said danglars .: 24.95
<S> the queen walked first , every one followed her .: 42.07
<S> even his breathing seemed to be arrested .: 58.73
<S> i shall kneel down to pray ; do not strike then . when shall i strike ? when i shall lay my head on the block and say remember ! then strike boldly . gentlemen , said the king to those around him , i leave you to brave the tempest ; i go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms .: 94.77
<S> and what ? grimaud dictated .: 43.12
<S> very well ; come this way . d artagnan went toward a very small , low window , just large enough to let a man through .: 52.22
<S> quick to the louvre , said he , to the louvre without losing an instant , and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal .: 25.92
<S> but when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch athos grasped his dagger .: 76.51
<S> what is your name , in your turn , if you please ? d artagnan . to yours , monsieur . and above all others , cried d artagnan , as if carried away by his enthusiasm , to that of the king and the cardinal . the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of d artagnan if the wine had been bad ; but the wine was good , and he was convinced .: 28.98
<S> it is very simple , mousqueton had said ; he is thinking of groslow . it was captain groslow , the reader will remember , who had broken parry s head .: 59.16
<S> but my fears were this time ill founded ; i passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind i dreaded .: 88.70
<S> dante s cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger , but they saw it themselves .: 42.59
<S> a dinner in the old style .: 49.98
<S> arrived at the foot of the back stairs , he desired them to wait .: 33.73
<S> and the guardsman ? d artagnan . still my young scapegrace .: 79.41
<S> the solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature ; it was a gilt table supported on lions claws .: 89.87
<S> before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived .: 82.43
<S> if that s the case , said mousqueton , with a learned air , take some nourishment . do you call that nourishment ? said blaisois , pointing to the barley bread and pot of beer upon the table .: 51.52
<S> still further , buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against france , and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the english , imperial , and spanish armies .: 61.22
<S> he had but one fault he was a gourmand ; he had found the pates good , the wine excellent .: 85.84
<S> yes , said they , we have promised to deliver scotland and england from him who for the last five and twenty years has sucked the blood and gold of scotland and england .: 62.82
<S> open the door ! cried villefort .: 15.75
<S> sdeath ! he cried , with his gascon accent .: 11.44
<S> now , my young friend , said he , england is all our own .: 18.15
<S> but i repeat to you , i am charged with reclaiming it ; and if you do not give it up well ? he has , then , charged me to take it from you . how !: 26.14
<S> may i know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing m. de morcerf so early ? had you not a meeting with my son this morning ? asked the general .: 41.05
<S> he therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at mazingarbe .: 49.17
<S> when we observed this to him , he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business , as this horse belonged to him .: 57.08
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> if porthos were on his legs , he would have rejoined us by this time , said athos .: 29.77
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> she ! what she ? asked d artagnan .: 17.74
<S> at last : do you imagine , he resumed , that they mean to kill you ?: 36.32
<S> all that he had heard from these three different men , comminges , guitant and villequier , confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen ; and then anne of austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious .: 80.88
<S> as i had nothing more to do at versailles , i went to auteuil , and gained all the information i could .: 28.38
<S> he gained just twelve hours by this engagement ; he was to be back on the sixteenth day , by eight o clock in the evening .: 30.58
<S> an hour afterwards they returned .: 16.90
<S> it was like the eve of a battle ; the heart beat , the eyes laughed , and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose , was , after all , a good thing .: 58.50
<S> he was now a lieutenant .: 21.96
<S> unfasten it , or i will break it in ! said grimaud .: 45.24
<S> the gate is shut , said aramis , but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees , and perfect seclusion , i will get the key from the hotel de rohan and we shall be well suited . d artagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place .: 45.50
<S> god will punish you hereafter , but i will punish you here ! ah , this is too much ! cried buckingham , making a step toward the door .: 25.48
<S> d artagnan has conquered her her , that invincible power of evil .: 102.51
<S> you appear quite aghast .: 75.15
<S> but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass ? she . but who is she ? oh , i remember ! said mme .: 56.18
<S> they will know you are deserted , and think you also poor , for i alone know your real financial position , and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner . the dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this , was equalled by the calm indifference with which debray had spoken .: 85.83
<S> what is it ? i have spoken to you indiscreetly about danglars . on the contrary , speak to me always in the same strain about him . i am glad to be reassured on that point .: 35.99
<S> tell the count that i am well ; that you found me sad , but resigned . i am pleased , sir , to hear that . and the same , also , for monsieur du vallon not for me , cried porthos ; i am not by any means resigned . but you will be resigned , my friend . never ! he will become so , monsieur ; i know him better than he knows himself .: 46.98
<S> ten minutes after one is taken , the effect is produced .: 39.65
<S> how a gardener may get rid of the dormice chapter 62 .: 44.87
<S> charles , who is my prisoner , may still have friends , but i have none ! and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt .: 48.33
<S> c sar proposed to his father , that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard , or shake hands with them ; but alexander vi .: 57.83
<S> these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time , and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long .: 120.67
<S> the cicerone reclosed the door , and sprang up by the side of the coachman .: 19.58
<S> i shall probably kill you the fourth , said he to him , holding out his hand to assist him to rise .: 29.02
<S> it however likewise appeared that the soldier on duty a zealous catholic , no doubt shook off the charm , for through the door he called : hold your tongue , madame !: 100.72
<S> hold your tongue , stupid fellow , said d artagnan ; and laying hold of the casement , he let himself gently down from the first story , which fortunately was not very elevated , without doing himself the slightest injury .: 47.69
<S> my god , grant that he may one day suffer what i suffer ! upon the gospel , said d artagnan , throwing himself down by the dying man , i swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that i was going to drink of it as you did . i do not believe you , cried the soldier , and he expired amid horrible tortures .: 33.19
<S> splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls , intermingled with magnificent trophies of war , while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the room .: 92.50
<S> when you come to paris , i will return all this . i will not refuse ; i intend going there soon , and since you allow me , i will pay you a visit .: 26.45
<S> we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches .: 30.14
<S> that s the reason why i take such care you shall not deprive me of mine .: 36.32
<S> at first sight , nothing denoted the cardinal ; and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were .: 46.67
<S> this contest at length exhausted jussac s patience .: 122.68
<S> i thought i did , replied athos ; but no doubt i was mistaken . and he returned d artagnan the ring without , however , ceasing to look at it .: 30.21
<S> i was promised he should die with me .: 31.48
<S> emmanuel hesitated a moment , but his desire to make julie decide immediately made him reply .: 111.53
<S> it vexes me greatly , continued athos , that you attach so much importance to these animals , for i am not yet at the end of my story . what else have you done . after having lost my own horse , nine against ten see how near i formed an idea of staking yours . yes ; but you stopped at the idea , i hope ? no ; for i put it in execution that very minute . and the consequence ? said d artagnan , in great anxiety .: 56.15
<S> now , continued faria , addressing dante s with an almost paternal expression , now , my dear fellow , you know as much as i do myself .: 20.58
<S> noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief , that she arrested the departure of the notary .: 28.04
<S> i did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity ! and a bitter laugh escaped the count .: 58.12
<S> de saint me ran is dead , answered the old marchioness , without preface and without expression ; she appeared to be stupefied .: 46.57
<S> it only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex , interrupted valentine .: 98.50
<S> you kill me . be satisfied ; you are not guilty toward me , and i have already pardoned you . what next ?: 28.82
<S> i will write to him , then , nearly in these terms . let us see , said athos , assuming in advance a critical look .: 31.31
<S> is your horse tired ? tired ?: 148.94
<S> a mousetrap in the seventeenth century the invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days ; as soon as societies , in forming , had invented any kind of police , that police invented mousetraps .: 79.54
<S> the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon ; then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment .: 72.49
<S> i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance , to recover myself . monte cristo could not resist this proof of affection ; he not only extended his hand to the young man , but flew to him with open arms .: 33.17
<S> the poor girl , pale as death and trembling in all her limbs , wished to delay her lover ; but milady , with her ear on the watch , had heard the noise d artagnan had made , and opening the door , said , come in . all this was of such incredible immodesty , of such monstrous effrontery , that d artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard .: 41.88
<S> the baroness was astonished .: 21.20
<S> but he had gone farther than athos for at the village of festubert , while drinking at an inn , he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before , at half past eight , a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post chaise had been obliged to stop , unable to go further .: 53.23
<S> i will answer for it , said bonacieux .: 8.42
<S> why , you are mad , albert !: 22.00
<S> two hours afterwards he came on deck , as the boat was about to double the island of elba .: 22.00
<S> do you know them , fernand ? he said .: 10.39
<S> you first , mousqueton , and he stopped his friends , directing the valets to go first , in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat .: 37.93
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> it is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against dante s .: 47.45
<S> now , she thought , they could not long delay coming to clear the table , and that felton would then reappear .: 79.13
<S> when i say one spoonful , i began by one now i take four .: 142.49
<S> now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts , the night lighted up by his illusions , and the silence animated by his anticipations .: 79.75
<S> the staircase creaked , he descended into the room below , approached the fire and lit a candle .: 40.68
<S> did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting ? why , you know , my dear fellow , when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag , such singers as these don t make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others . at least , you must admire moriani s style and execution . i never fancied men of his dark , ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a woman s. my good friend , said franz , turning to him , while albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre , you seem determined not to approve ; you are really too difficult to please . the curtain at length fell on the performances , to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of morcerf , who seized his hat , rapidly passed his fingers through his hair , arranged his cravat and wristbands , and signified to franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way .: 67.91
<S> i followed him thither , and i saw him enter the house where we now are , only , instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street , he came on horseback , or in his carriage , left the one or the other at the little inn , and entered by the gate you see there . monte cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which bertuccio alluded .: 33.68
<S> speak freely .: 67.44
<S> suppose , he said , we roughly chalk out a career for this young man .: 76.22
<S> what do you want ? asked blaisois .: 5.46
<S> do you think it is worth while ? said villefort .: 15.62
<S> once for all , tre ville had placed his stable at d artagnan s service .: 30.63
<S> the repast was carried into effect that very day , and the lackey waited at table .: 78.84
<S> now go . he made a sign to cocles , who went first ; the seamen followed him and emmanuel brought up the rear .: 43.46
<S> he escapes us , growled porthos , pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges , but in vain .: 67.59
<S> come , no hypocrisy !: 51.63
<S> now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself ; so in reaching the walls which surrounded the palais royal , the cardinal knocked at a little door , and after thanking d artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the palais royal , he made a sign to guitant to follow him .: 43.43
<S> the point was , then , to discover the hidden entrance .: 29.96
<S> athos replaced his in his belt ; porthos and aramis , who held their drawn swords in their hands , returned them to their scabbards .: 42.19
<S> look at monsieur du vallon , that faithful soul , that arm of steel , who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage .: 88.58
<S> a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship .: 58.01
<S> you are sure it is not he ? said she .: 16.21
<S> monsieur de beaufort escaped ? my lord , i saw him run off from the top of the terrace . and you did not fire on him ? he was out of range . monsieur de chavigny where was he ? absent . and la ramee ? was found locked up in the prisoner s room , a gag in his mouth and a poniard near him . but the man who was under him ? was an accomplice of the duke s and escaped along with him . mazarin groaned .: 43.47
<S> oh , death is in my house ! cried villefort .: 14.81
<S> now guess what the young one did ? tell me . he carried off the corpse , which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall ; then he entered the empty dungeon , closed the entrance , and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body .: 51.07
<S> the carriage stopped near the meta sudans ; the door was opened , and the young men , eagerly alighting , found themselves opposite a cicerone , who appeared to have sprung up from the ground , so unexpected was his appearance .: 38.32
<S> they were guarded , not only by armed men , but even by women and children .: 45.23
<S> on the first day of that month our four companions had landed at boulogne , and , in two parties , had set out for paris .: 27.98
<S> do not leave me !: 19.77
<S> he had gone to the rendezvous , had encountered there the adversary indicated , whose name he had never known , had given him a pretty sword stroke on the arm , then had gone toward aramis , who at the same time came to meet him , having already finished his affair .: 46.85
<S> now , one evening when d artagnan , who was in the trenches , was not able to accompany them , athos , porthos , and aramis , mounted on their battle steeds , enveloped in their war cloaks , with their hands upon their pistol butts , were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot , which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie , following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard , as we have stated , for fear of an ambuscade , when , about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau , they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them .: 43.73
<S> do you not think that i also long for forgetfulness ?: 36.69
<S> where for ? for la rochelle . he need not sail ! cried milady , forgetting her usual presence of mind .: 63.75
<S> ah , haitians , that is quite another thing !: 30.28
<S> and the drawers ? yes . those at the side ? no . the middle one ? yes . valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers .: 45.75
<S> you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask ; for really , in spite of his excellent intentions , i could not thank him for what he has done . mordaunt bowed humbly .: 42.73
<S> i have come for nothing else but to tell you so . but what is the meaning of this change ? i can not tell you . explain yourself . i can not explain myself . come , tell me , what is the joke ? monsieur le vicomte knows that i never joke . yes , but i know also that monsieur le comte de la fere arranged that you were to remain with me and that olivain should return to paris .: 26.61
<S> she renewed the order relative to the gascon ; but as before she expected him in vain .: 50.11
<S> the pope heaped attentions upon rospigliosi and spada , conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate , and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at rome .: 85.89
<S> are there not some latin verses upon that subject ?: 71.96
<S> at the same minute , one of the little windows of the ho tel de ville was thrown open , and the head of a gendarme appeared .: 15.87
<S> plague on t , i will guard the king and porthos shall guard the cardinal . this arrangement pleased every one .: 123.91
<S> lord de winter went out , making a sign to felton , who followed him , shutting the door after him .: 12.38
<S> through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir , containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch .: 56.44
<S> the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression .: 29.95
<S> the king ! cried out several voices , deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of winter ; take him alive . no !: 100.66
<S> arriving at the faubourg st. antoine , he turned round to look gaily at the bastille ; but as it was the bastille alone he looked at , he did not observe milady , who , mounted upon a light chestnut horse , designated him with her finger to two ill looking men who came close up to the ranks to take notice of him .: 53.68
<S> the two kingdoms are so near that france must be interested in our situation , as we are interested in that of france .: 43.77
<S> if you are not located in the united states , you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this ebook .: 10.33
<S> meanwhile , he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city , which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues , and recalling the saying of louis xi. , his political predecessor , as he himself was the predecessor of robespierre , he repeated this maxim of tristan s gossip : divide in order to reign . henry iv. , when besieging paris , had loaves and provisions thrown over the walls .: 106.24
<S> the wall was built of rough stones , among which , to give strength to the structure , blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded .: 79.03
<S> i have engaged the three lower windows at the cafe rospoli ; should i have obtained the requisite pardon for peppino , the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks , and the centre with white , having a large cross in red marked on it . and whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution ? send one of your men , disguised as a penitent friar , and i will give it to him .: 67.82
<S> bazin scratched at the door , and as aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him , he bade him come in .: 32.55
<S> i have encountered misfortune in a high place , a royal misfortune , a european misfortune ; i attach myself to it .: 66.45
<S> two of his comrades of the guards immediately sprang forward , and two other soldiers having joined them , the number was deemed sufficient .: 65.07
<S> you love my mistress , then , very dearly , monsieur chevalier ? said she .: 24.06
<S> the first part of the entertainment being concluded pistache was desired to say what o clock it was ; he was shown monsieur de chavigny s watch ; it was then half past six ; the dog raised and dropped his paw six times ; the seventh he let it remain upraised .: 92.99
<S> they proceeded silently to the centre of the place , but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud , they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the lime trees .: 37.35
<S> at the expiration of ten minutes felton came .: 14.07
<S> oliver cromwell .: 41.93
<S> good evening , m. beauchamp , said monte cristo , as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening ; be seated . beauchamp bowed , and , sitting down , sir , said he , i just now accompanied m. de morcerf , as you saw . and that means , replied monte cristo , laughing , that you had , probably , just dined together .: 32.64
<S> she thought that lord de winter would perhaps send felton himself to get the order signed by the duke of buckingham .: 42.59
<S> father and son chapter 13 .: 63.28
<S> no , this is his blood . where were you , then ? where you left me under the scaffold . did you see it all ? no , but i heard all .: 28.00
<S> if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase project gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work , you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.e.1 through 1.e.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the project gutenberg trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.e.8 or 1.e.9 .: 14.92
<S> impious task ! cried milady , with the exultation of a victim who provokes his judge .: 77.85
<S> well , inquired the jeweller , is the cash all right ? yes , said caderousse .: 31.30
<S> here i shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives , and that , in all human probability , will be the hour of my death .: 34.48
<S> he had a heavy hand dear old athos after drinking . d artagnan , after asking the man the right way , continued his route , agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a gentleman .: 103.17
<S> but first write your request to dessessart .: 101.14
<S> do you understand ? that s no doubt very fine , said porthos ; but deuce take me if i understand at all . porthos , my friend , you know i am descended on the father s side from the prophets and on the mother s from the sybils , and that i only speak in parables and riddles .: 44.24
<S> how did you penetrate hither ?: 80.70
<S> the executioner let fall his mace , drew his knife , and with one stroke opened his throat , and mounting on his stomach , stamped violently on it with his feet .: 49.52
<S> do not seek to assist me in that which i am accomplishing .: 43.07
<S> lord de winter passed before the door without stopping , and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die away .: 29.71
<S> m. dessessart , who esteemed d artagnan , made him offers of help , as this change would entail expenses for equipment .: 142.65
<S> oh , i can not tell what she says to me !: 18.03
<S> he was punctual , dressed in black , with crape around his hat , and presented himself at his cousin s with a face made up for the occasion , and which he could alter as might be required .: 60.14
<S> that is to say , cried bonacieux , who saw he had taken a false step , that is to say you have answered that you should recognize him , said the commissary .: 22.63
<S> when one is going to be married , there is nothing like implicit confidence ; but never mind that , my boy , go and announce your arrival , and let her know all your hopes and prospects . i will go directly , was edmond s reply ; and , embracing his father , and nodding to caderousse , he left the apartment .: 41.06
<S> struck in the breast and extending his arms , the spaniard fell back on the crupper , and the terrified horse , turning around , carried him off .: 51.59
<S> the young girl hastily took the letter from him .: 23.80
<S> he saw that he was on the highest point of the island , a statue on this vast pedestal of granite , nothing human appearing in sight , while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island , and covered it with a fringe of foam .: 42.65
<S> fortunately , morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely ; and , as they reached him , he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of july came .: 57.95
<S> every time i see you is a fresh diamond which i enclose in the casket of my heart .: 47.69
<S> they were indeed admirably received by mazarin , who paid them numerous compliments , and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired , namely , d artagnan his captaincy , porthos his barony .: 76.35
<S> the history of the scuttled vessels , which had appeared improbable during the day , seemed very probable at night ; placed as he was between two possible sources of danger , he kept his eye on the crew , and his gun in his hand .: 73.58
<S> if she seduced your brother you said she seduced him , did you not ? yes . if she caused his death you said that she caused his death ? yes , repeated the executioner .: 47.08
<S> he got in it , and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions , arrived about midnight in the rue meslay , threw himself on his bed and slept soundly .: 57.16
<S> well , i fortunately recognize you !: 63.75
<S> you foolish fellow ! said athos , laughing .: 26.30
<S> yes i should expect so ; besides , if they forget , i shall take the liberty of reminding them . the queen s voice !: 40.50
<S> it is well as it is ; say no more about it . at least you should tell me what i should have to do in london , replied bonacieux , who remembered a little too late that rochefort had desired him to endeavor to obtain his wife s secrets .: 32.49
<S> it was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled .: 85.99
<S> anne of austria lowered her head , allowed the torrent to flow on without replying , hoping that it would cease of itself ; but this was not what louis xiii .: 49.58
<S> dante s , your health . fernand rose impatiently .: 52.01
<S> but too late by a minute , unfortunate , unfortunate that i am ! felton made no resistance .: 57.70
<S> unless i die , i shall always be what i am , and therefore it is that i utter the things you have never heard , even from the mouths of kings for kings have need , and other persons have fear of you .: 60.30
<S> of what nature ? why , you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage . certainly ; and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one . now , then , in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain . franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination .: 43.89
<S> i can not consent that this woman should die thus ! milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope .: 52.83
<S> i told you of it yesterday .: 18.87
<S> danglars waited a moment , expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage .: 72.48
<S> what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source , seems to me to proceed from one far less pure .: 110.22
<S> i have not seen you , consequently i know nothing of your dinner . how foolish you are !: 28.23
<S> get your clothes together .: 82.64
<S> but he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty ; he had forgotten that .: 51.74
<S> she was within three steps of the bottom ; she already heard morrel s voice , when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes , her stiffened foot missed the step , her hands had no power to hold the baluster , and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor .: 64.02
<S> only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of france . no jesting upon that subject , gentlemen , said porthos ; thank god the queen is still of an age to give one ! they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france , replied aramis , with a significant smile which gave to this sentence , apparently so simple , a tolerably scandalous meaning .: 60.72
<S> because , madame , it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubted that is , that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands . and that valor would shrink from no undertaking , according to what i see . it has hesitated at nothing in the past ; why , then , should it be less daring in the future ? then , in case of my refusal , this valor , should a struggle occur , will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court , to deliver me into the hands of the fronde , as you propose to deliver my minister ? we have not thought about it yet , madame , answered d artagnan , with that gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete ; but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly . i ought , muttered anne to herself , by this time to remember that these men are giants . alas , madame ! exclaimed d artagnan , this proves to me that not till to day has your majesty had a just idea of us . perhaps , said anne ; but that idea , if at last i have it your majesty will do us justice .: 75.52
<S> sire , replied the courtier , laughing , in order that he might seem to comprehend the quotation , your majesty may be perfectly right in relying on the good feeling of france , but i fear i am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt . by whom ? by bonaparte , or , at least , by his adherents . my dear blacas , said the king , you with your alarms prevent me from working . and you , sire , prevent me from sleeping with your security . wait , my dear sir , wait a moment ; for i have such a delightful note on the pastor quum traheret wait , and i will listen to you afterwards . there was a brief pause , during which louis xviii .: 51.85
<S> he urged the horse again into a trot .: 47.60
<S> can we have the honor of seeing his highness ? i shall be proud to present you , and rochefort walked on .: 38.13
<S> come , come , said albert , do not assume so much indifference .: 19.98
<S> for pity s sake , he cried , pale and bewildered , without seeing whom he was addressing , for pity s sake do not call assistance !: 42.89
<S> we may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in france , if we are not poisoned or killed before then . meanwhile , let us dine , suggested porthos .: 38.91
<S> well , i have ten thousand for you . you are not boasting ? do you wish for a proof ? yes . there were three candles alight , each of which burnt before a window , one looking upon the city , the other upon the palais royal , and a third upon the rue saint denis .: 35.18
<S> is he still in a fit ? said the procureur .: 18.12
<S> come this way , and let us know when the wedding is to be , for fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us . hold your tongue , will you ? said danglars , pretending to restrain caderousse , who , with the tenacity of drunkards , leaned out of the arbor .: 36.64
<S> it was athos he had recognized , and porthos who was boring a hole through the wall .: 52.04
<S> i know a man who will find the means of taking me from paris , a man i have too long forgotten . then falling into a reverie , she added , however , with an expression of joy , ungrateful woman that i am , for twenty years i have forgotten this man , whom i ought to have made a marechal of france .: 33.33
<S> porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard .: 47.35
<S> so au revoir , dear athos . au revoir , said the musketeer , making a sign to grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just brought .: 29.67
<S> married at eighteen to m. bonacieux , having always lived among her husband s friends people little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was above her position mme .: 122.37
<S> then seated on a chair , she looked at the manly countenance of monte cristo , on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression .: 53.85
<S> a dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl .: 37.34
<S> is it absolutely necessary , then , to send the money to luigi vampa ? asked the young man , looking fixedly in his turn at the count .: 17.38
<S> d artagnan regained the trench , and threw the corpse beside the wounded man , who was as pale as death .: 18.50
<S> there are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand .: 176.65
<S> come , speak . monsieur de cavois . monsieur de cavois ? in person . the captain of the cardinal s guards ? himself . did he come to arrest me ? i have no doubt that he did , monsieur , for all his wheedling manner . was he so sweet , then ? indeed , he was all honey , monsieur . indeed ! he came , he said , on the part of his eminence , who wished you well , and to beg you to follow him to the palais royal . it was called the palais cardinal before richelieu gave it to the king .: 30.26
<S> you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing project gutenberg electronic works provided that : you pay a royalty fee of 20 of the gross profits you derive from the use of project gutenberg works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes .: 25.40
<S> the police had orders to make the strictest search for the murderer .: 45.14
<S> indeed , her brain was only the seat of vague ideas , and confused forms , mingled with strange fancies , alone presented themselves before her eyes .: 99.68
<S> what must i answer ? the truth . then i shall say the duel did not take place ? you will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo .: 28.00
<S> villefort , pale and agitated , ran to the window , put aside the curtain , and saw him pass , cool and collected , by two or three ill looking men at the corner of the street , who were there , perhaps , to arrest a man with black whiskers , and a blue frock coat , and hat with broad brim .: 28.83
<S> ja ! in the most german and the least gascon accent possible .: 125.57
<S> and is not this daughter dead ? demanded monte cristo ; i fancy i have heard so . yes , monsieur , one and twenty years ago ; and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times . thanks , thanks , said monte cristo , judging from the steward s utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it .: 49.07
<S> they poured a little rum down his throat , and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him , produced the same effect as formerly .: 77.12
<S> they were willing and ready to retrace their steps , when , in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town , upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart , athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk , which represented , with the awkwardness of a first attempt , two cavaliers riding furiously ; one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words : they are following us . oh ! exclaimed athos , here it is , as clear as day ; pursued as he was , d artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely , which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping . aramis shook his head .: 59.89
<S> now , my lord , do not forget , if any harm happens to me on your account , that i have a wife and four children . rest assured ; put the gag in , grimaud . in a second la ramee was gagged and laid prostrate .: 42.11
<S> chance is so capricious .: 206.19
<S> it would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret , and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you .: 47.45
<S> as for the sailors , although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert , and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing , and on which a few fishing boats , with their white sails , were alone visible .: 40.35
<S> a quick glance conveyed his thought to porthos : if athos knows where we are , if he opens communication with us , before long athos will act . porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances , but now since the name of athos had suggested to him the same idea , he understood .: 68.89
<S> you know that my means are limited , and that i am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions .: 62.12
<S> zounds !: 34.39
<S> ah , i m ready to do what you will , cried porthos ; even to swear by mahomet .: 58.42
<S> he had formed his resolution .: 18.89
<S> m . the epistle is laconic , said d artagnan ; and if there had not been a postscript , probably i should not have understood it ; but happily there is a postscript . and he read that welcome postscript , which made him forget the abruptness of the letter .: 40.41
<S> how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning ? all owing to your influence , replied monte cristo , smiling .: 45.33
<S> or a tiger ? ali bowed his head in token of assent .: 28.86
<S> but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived ; beppo has taken in plenty of others . and beppo led him outside the walls ? said the count .: 73.02
<S> it is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard , or a railroad from the jardin des plantes to la ra pe e. never mind what he says , morcerf , said debray , do you marry her .: 66.27
<S> yes , among your friends of other times ; among those who aided you to contend against the duc de richelieu and even to conquer him . what is he aiming at ? murmured the queen , looking uneasily at the cardinal .: 48.68
<S> some few minutes had elapsed , and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience , when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof , and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it , and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him ; then , as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle , he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs , and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground , and then leaped lightly on his feet .: 53.58
<S> well , said gondy , have you kept your word with me ? not exactly , replied the mendicant .: 18.19
<S> aramis smiled as one who hopes .: 126.92
<S> is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week ? asked the mercer , piqued to the quick .: 37.86
<S> they have some capital wine here please to observe that in passing .: 122.08
<S> he whose intellect was thus supreme , raoul , was the actual sovereign ; the other , nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul ; and yet , so powerful is majesty amongst us , this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away .: 84.81
<S> besides , d artagnan from her own admission knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important , and could entertain no respect for her .: 107.17
<S> the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his side not from fear , god be thanked , he had not the shade of it , but with emulation ; he fought like a furious tiger , turning ten times round his adversary , and changing his ground and his guard twenty times .: 100.88
<S> it was as a prey to this hallucination that d artagnan traveled , at whatever pace his horse pleased , the six or eight leagues that separated chantilly from cre vec ur , without his being able to remember on his arrival in the village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road .: 77.94
<S> this island was , always had been , and still is , completely deserted .: 78.01
<S> the wretches were dancing .: 63.13
<S> apropos , my lord !: 19.10
<S> you are free , he said , through me ; your liberty was my ransom . agreed ; but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery , to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall , which causes a tub to turn , revealing a staircase must not one speak of that a little , my lord ? diavolo ! cried mazarin , almost choked , and clasping his hands ; i am a lost and ruined man ! but without listening to his protestations of alarm , d artagnan slipped him gently down into the arms of athos , who stood immovable at the bottom of the wall .: 63.81
<S> no , dear morcerf ; you know i only refuse when the thing is impossible .: 52.80
<S> i must absolutely see it ; i shall find a way . no nonsense , caderousse ! i will offer myself as floor polisher . the rooms are all carpeted . well , then , i must be contented to imagine it . that is the best plan , believe me . try , at least , to give me an idea of what it is . how can i ? nothing is easier .: 40.70
<S> eventually she was obliged to leave france .: 60.93
<S> he was of pale complexion , with clear blue eyes , rather deeply set ; his mouth , fine and well cut , remained motionless in its correct lines ; his chin , strongly marked , denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy ; a brow a little receding , as is proper for poets , enthusiasts , and soldiers , was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which , like the beard which covered the lower part of his face , was of a beautiful deep chestnut color .: 102.14
<S> this unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in paris on the tenth of january and the prince of conti was named , but not until after a stormy discussion , generalissimo of the army of the king , out of paris .: 53.61
<S> he s not more cunning than de richelieu was !: 117.27
<S> if you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .: 14.15
<S> what have i done wrong , father , she said , that you should take this key from me ? nothing , my dear , replied the unhappy man , the tears starting to his eyes at this simple question , nothing , only i want it . julie made a pretence to feel for the key .: 46.42
<S> the carriage stopped , the officer descended , approached the guardhouse , a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order ; dante s saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay .: 36.60
<S> everything . count , said albert , in a low tone to monte cristo , do allow the signora to tell me something of her history .: 27.67
<S> the people were infuriated ; they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces , whilst i opened the doors of the carriage and monsieur de rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd .: 57.37
<S> at the last hour we must confess this action and god knows better than we can whether it is a crime , a fault , or a meritorious deed .: 57.55
<S> with much pleasure , your excellency , if it would amuse you ; and i will get you the torch you ask for .: 36.54
<S> instead of aiding the movements of my horse , i paralyzed them ; and i was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world , when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water ; therefore , sir , if you will agree , henceforward we are friends until death . sir , replied raoul , bowing , i am entirely at your service , i assure you . i am called the count de guiche , continued the young man ; my father is the marechal de grammont ; and now that you know who i am , do me the honor to inform me who you are . i am the viscount de bragelonne , answered raoul , blushing at being unable to name his father , as the count de guiche had done .: 30.18
<S> he wished to confess to the officer , and upon his refusal , uttered such pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus , he should put a gag in his mouth .: 49.30
<S> do you hear , baron ?: 13.45
<S> you insist on my contradicting the article relating to general fernand , an article with which , i assure you on my word of honor , i had nothing whatever to do ? yes , i insist on it , said albert , whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings .: 45.45
<S> well ?: 23.82
<S> they found him up , less pale than when d artagnan left him after his first visit , and seated at a table on which , though he was alone , was spread enough for four persons .: 45.15
<S> i am here almost miraculously , and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur again .: 64.98
<S> do not forget that i have been five years in the bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison . ah , monsieur de rochefort !: 40.23
<S> you see i am more candid than you . ah , my father ! said franz , interrupting himself .: 21.97
<S> stop ! cried d artagnan , giving rein to his famous steed , who , darting forth , overturned several men .: 50.63
<S> d artagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off .: 32.28
<S> all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity , without the police interfering in the matter .: 77.45
<S> well , mother , i yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the spahis , 25 added the young man , lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame , for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self abasement .: 78.30
<S> two hours passed away without anything fresh happening .: 42.17
<S> i am at quite a loss how to answer you , i admit , said mme .: 44.44
<S> anne of austria bent down and whispered in the young king s ear : say something gracious to monsieur d artagnan , my son . the young king leaned toward the door .: 41.43
<S> never !: 43.48
<S> yes , sir , replied the young man naively ; i felt a great chill at my heart , and at the word fire , which resounded in spanish from the enemy s ranks , i closed my eyes and thought of you . in honest truth , raoul ? said athos , pressing his hand .: 33.89
<S> bertuccio , said he , i intend going this evening to normandy , instead of tomorrow or the next day .: 37.34
<S> a gentleman laughed in my face .: 78.23
<S> without appearing to have heard the dialogue , of which she had not lost a word , she began again , giving to her voice all the charm , all the power , all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it : for all my tears , my cares , my exile , and my chains , i have my youth , my prayers , and god , who counts my pains . her voice , of immense power and sublime expression , gave to the rude , unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren , and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination .: 74.40
<S> a sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth ; another , whom he recognized as the one who had cried out courage ! held a gourd full of rum to his mouth ; while the third , an old sailor , at once the pilot and captain , looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday , and which may overtake them tomorrow .: 104.78
<S> but without taking any heed of the sword , milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him , and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat .: 49.41
<S> monsieur d artagnan ! cried the latter , like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep , monsieur d artagnan ! himself , monsieur bernouin . and why have you come here ? to bring news of monsieur de mazarin the freshest news there is . what has become of him , then ? he is as well as you and i. nothing bad has happened to him , then ? absolutely nothing .: 32.84
<S> certainly i was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison ; but you may easily comprehend , felton , that the more superb the prison , the greater was my terror .: 75.66
<S> we must content ourselves , then , said beauchamp , with rendering the count all the little services in our power .: 49.31
<S> my mother in law expended gold , caresses , dignities on concini , who ruined her ; the king made vitry marechal of france for an assassination : while i have left in obscurity , in poverty , the noble d artagnan , who saved me ! and running to a table , on which were paper , pens and ink , she hastily began to write .: 89.83
<S> grimaud looked after him , and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper .: 21.24
<S> louis xiv .: 21.44
<S> you may copy it , give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at www.gutenberg.org .: 8.75
<S> it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong , or rather , to say the truth more exactly , it was the first time he had ever heard of it .: 25.93
<S> the queen stretched out her hand , seized the ring , pressed it convulsively to her lips and without being able to breathe a sigh , to give vent to a sob , she extended her arms , became deadly pale , and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter .: 32.57
<S> and moreover , i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell .: 42.88
<S> he took his army to the priest s , where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months , and to the cornet s , who performed wonders ; but as planchet said , people do not eat at once for all time , even when they eat a good deal . d artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions as the breakfast at the priest s could only be counted as half a repast in return for the feasts which athos , porthos , and aramis had procured him .: 90.24
<S> the duke was in the act of combing his beard , which he had allowed to grow , as well as his hair , in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition .: 36.13
<S> i should affirm the culpability . and i deny it , said tre ville .: 39.46
<S> when the wretched man again opened his eyes , the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity , and his lips moved as if in prayer .: 20.77
<S> the worthy shipowner knew , from penelon s recital , of the captain s brave conduct during the storm , and tried to console him .: 74.28
<S> is it madame de morcerf who has displeased you ?: 20.10
<S> franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him , and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal .: 52.07
<S> the man of superior abilities always finds admirers , go where he will .: 151.92
<S> they were his friends and not mine .: 48.45
<S> it is an infernal apparition !: 37.07
<S> you put on a livery , you disguise yourself as a servant , and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs . you guess well . i know something of diamonds ; i have had some . you do well to boast of it , said andrea , who , without becoming angry , as caderousse feared , at this new extortion , quietly resigned the ring .: 44.41
<S> oh , signora , if i could but speak greek , your conversation , added to the fairy scene which surrounds me , would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget . i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you , sir , said hayde e quietly ; and if you like what is eastern , i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here . on what subject shall i converse with her ? said albert , in a low tone to monte cristo .: 50.85
<S> in truth , the lieutenant s horse stumbled and fell on his knees ; then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die .: 43.23
<S> at the end of an instant s observation he heard the noise of a vehicle , and saw milady s carriage stop opposite to him .: 20.36
<S> it is no affair of mine . i know not why you meddle , said fernand , seizing his arm ; but this i know , you have some motive of personal hatred against dante s , for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others . i !: 46.29
<S> zounds !: 34.39
<S> but at the same moment , his two auditors , accompanied by the host , fell upon d artagnan with sticks , shovels and tongs .: 29.58
<S> but what changes occur !: 100.97
<S> here , said he , is the price of the execution , that it may be plain we act as judges . that is correct , said the executioner ; and now in her turn , let this woman see that i am not fulfilling my trade , but my debt . and he threw the money into the river .: 39.93
<S> my dear planchet , i am the happiest of men ! and i may profit by monsieur s happiness , and go to bed ? yes , go . may the blessings of heaven fall upon monsieur !: 64.56
<S> that s too many , gentlemen , too many !: 37.15
<S> she howled as the hurricane howled ; and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature , which also seemed to groan with despair .: 51.60
<S> here i am . wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us . why all these precautions ? you shall know . milady arose , went to the door , opened it , looked in the corridor , and then returned and seated herself close to mme .: 37.20
<S> the blow was parried .: 32.31
<S> the third of my friends , although my rival , was much attached to me , his name was fernand ; that of my betrothed was stay , stay , continued the abbe , i have forgotten what he called her . merce de s , said caderousse eagerly .: 37.72
<S> she is all powerful yonder ; she will help me .: 53.94
<S> how he has shrunk since he gave up the name of porthos ! this can not be monsieur porthos , observed planchet replying , as it were , to his master s thoughts .: 54.58
<S> he passed on to another it , also , was empty , but the third which he tried was , from the dull sound it gave out , evidently full .: 108.71
<S> i also have made my preparations this morning . oh , heavens !: 25.51
<S> they arrived in about an hour at the cemetery ; the weather was mild , but dull , and in harmony with the funeral ceremony .: 50.94
<S> why so ? i play with monsieur du vallon every night .: 61.12
<S> well , upon my honor , said athos , your eminence is right in taking us with you ; we have seen several ill looking faces on the road , and we have even had a quarrel at the red dovecot with four of those faces . a quarrel , and what for , gentlemen ? said the cardinal ; you know i don t like quarrelers . and that is the reason why i have the honor to inform your eminence of what has happened ; for you might learn it from others , and upon a false account believe us to be in fault . what have been the results of your quarrel ? said the cardinal , knitting his brow .: 42.54
<S> sir , replied he , if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction , you should have gone at once to the point , and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour .: 37.02
<S> can they have received any news , my lord ? not from england , madame .: 36.77
<S> colonel harrison is one of our friends .: 43.13
<S> ah , count , said he , his father loves him so much ! do not speak to me of that , said monte cristo , with the first movement of anger he had betrayed ; i will make him suffer . morrel , amazed , let fall monte cristo s hand .: 17.76
<S> is it to do us some ill turn ?: 55.29
<S> in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp .: 130.94
<S> is it heaven that opens before me ? thought the dying man ; that angel resembles the one i have lost . monte cristo pointed out morrel to the young woman , who advanced towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips .: 37.15
<S> and why not ? because you will look into yourself , and you will do justice to the lady . i should do her justice by sending her to tyburn , said buckingham .: 30.40
<S> m. de tre ville , after having written the letter , sealed it , and rising , approached the young man in order to give it to him .: 13.78
<S> gentlemen , he said , turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak spanish and serve me as interpreter ? i can , my lord , said raoul .: 33.39
<S> yes , it is one of milady s bastards ! you laugh aramis . from habit , that is all .: 35.13
<S> again , you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet , amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages . nay , indeed , your excellency . i am not condemning you for this , monsieur baptistin ; but let your profits end here .: 72.09
<S> my dear athos , he said , i am going away .: 11.23
<S> i am a straightforward , simple man ; that s my great disadvantage .: 39.29
<S> yes , continued the curate , apparently accustomed to this tone , yes , we wish to know your opinion of the events of to day and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church . the mendicant shook his head .: 44.81
<S> the house was ready , and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men , who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea .: 62.28
<S> charles returned in silence to his chair , rested his elbow on the table , bowed his head upon his hand and reflected .: 28.53
<S> ah , this is not right ; athos insults us ; he wishes to die alone ; it is bad , bad , bad . mousqueton , witnessing this despair , melted into tears in a corner of the room .: 47.78
<S> speak , said the monk .: 13.77
<S> and how does france appear in your eyes , accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes ? i think it is a fine country , said hayde e , but i see france as it really is , because i look on it with the eyes of a woman ; whereas my own country , which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind , always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere , which is luminous or otherwise , according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous . so young , said albert , forgetting at the moment the count s command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself , is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name ? hayde e turned her eyes towards monte cristo , who , making at the same time some imperceptible sign , murmured : speak . nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood , and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you , all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness . 40068m speak , speak , signora , said albert , i am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say . hayde e answered his remark with a melancholy smile .: 69.05
<S> begone , begone ! at these words she opened the door of the corridor , and pushed d artagnan out of the room .: 16.24
<S> he said he was going to the catalans , and he is going to the city .: 15.11
<S> the man placed his finger on her lips .: 15.95
<S> it s my spanish wine that has got into your head , is it not ?: 32.99
<S> and , indeed , i am not sorry to quit paris ; i had need of distraction . well , you will have distractions enough , gentlemen , be assured , said d artagnan .: 25.71
<S> where has he gone ? i do not know . what do you mean ?: 11.25
<S> and now let us see , young man , with your hand upon your conscience , how did all this come to pass ? d artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details ; how , not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his majesty , he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience ; how they had gone together to the tennis court , and how , upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive a ball in the face , he had been jeered at by bernajoux , who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life , and m. de la tre mouille , who had nothing to do with the matter , with the loss of his ho tel .: 41.66
<S> despite the weight of two bodies , the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air .: 50.01
<S> yes , we did some fine things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel . and he heaved a sigh .: 91.29
<S> he replaced the lid , as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it , and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment .: 46.53
<S> yes , yes , said felton ; i understand how he would act .: 15.81
<S> the duc de beaufort .: 13.41
<S> well , well , my dear edmond , continued the owner , don t let me detain you .: 15.11
<S> this time it was a great matter that was under discussion , connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets , stuffs of the levant , and cashmeres .: 72.99
<S> the count alone seemed unmoved nay , more , a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks .: 80.64
<S> or , s blood , my brave athos will die ! at the cries of m. de tre ville , the whole assemblage rushed into the cabinet , he not thinking to shut the door against anyone , and all crowded round the wounded man .: 54.84
<S> sire , it was impossible to learn ; the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper . and how did this despatch reach you ? inquired the king .: 46.94
<S> on arriving at the hotel de la chevrette they found the baron s equipage all ready and mousqueton on his saddle .: 39.22
<S> without reckoning , added monte cristo , that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the united states and in england , but quite novel in france . yes , yes , i know what you mean , the railway , of which he has obtained the grant , is it not ? precisely ; it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair . ten millions !: 38.58
<S> go on , my child , said the count in the romaic language .: 10.31
<S> perhaps you liked what m. danglars said ? another sign in the negative .: 131.45
<S> this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels .: 84.92
<S> go to your father ; go and see merce de s , and afterwards come to me . shall i row you ashore ? no , thank you ; i shall remain and look over the accounts with danglars .: 44.31
<S> and now remember one thing , monsieur officer , that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill advised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness . 40108m i promised him to wait , replied morrel ; and i will wait . at this moment barrois entered .: 54.64
<S> a most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the hotel de la chevrette for the discovery of planchet .: 50.11
<S> if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king , when , in their turn , they were in power , your brother would be today , in all probability , condemned to death .: 33.64
<S> m. de tre ville entertained good company , wholly anticardinalist , though .: 94.10
<S> the clerk continued to write for the next five minutes ; the man preserved profound silence , and remained perfectly motionless .: 60.28
<S> monte cristo noticed the general astonishment , and began laughing and joking about it .: 75.17
<S> so i shall never be a great man , as he was , but to compensate for that , i shall be a good man , monsieur de rochefort , and i hope to prove it to you . rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice , in which sounded sometimes a sort of gentle lisp , like the hissing of young vipers .: 41.04
<S> the victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four men .: 51.98
<S> good heavens !: 14.43
<S> you must know all your officers i mean those more distinguished . why , yes , very nearly . will you then kindly tell me if you have in your command the chevalier d artagnan , lieutenant in the musketeers ? no , sir , he is not with us ; he left paris more than six weeks ago and is believed to have gone on a mission to england . i knew that , but i supposed he had returned . no , sir ; no one has seen him .: 48.22
<S> when i speak of ignominy , you think i speak of some chastisement , of imprisonment or death .: 60.31
<S> it was given to you by that veiled lady i met you with the other sunday , near the gate st. honore . no , upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman , i bought it with the contents of my own purse , answered he whom they designated by the name porthos .: 59.77
<S> stay ! stay ! how strange that it should not have occurred to me before !: 63.45
<S> seventeen months captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean , is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited .: 186.27
<S> be easy , kitty , there is something between that man and me that he is quite ignorant of : he nearly made me lose my credit with his eminence .: 73.77
<S> now , i can not for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it . there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat , open the door of the box , and offer the countess his arm .: 76.63
<S> excuse me . excuse you for what ?: 70.58
<S> think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators , the sage matrons who took their daughters , and the charming vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said , come , despatch the dying . shall you go , then , albert ? asked franz .: 76.31
<S> i do not know . do you wish for anything ? i wish to see the governor . the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber .: 17.52
<S> upon a look from the procurator , accompanied by a smile from mme .: 47.83
<S> forward ! chapter lxxxv .: 51.26
<S> when d artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery , athos had been waiting about five minutes , and twelve o clock was striking .: 47.96
<S> it is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed ; he possesses fortune , a high rank in society , and every personal qualification likely to render valentine supremely happy , his name , moreover , can not be wholly unknown to you .: 66.28
<S> when the gentleman who came three months ago the agent of thomson french arrives , announce his arrival to me . cocles made no reply ; he made a sign with his head , went into the anteroom , and seated himself .: 31.91
<S> and what is it to you ? replied the king ; we are not of the same religion . all men are brothers , said the puritan .: 20.09
<S> valentine looked at her watch .: 17.15
<S> a tailor , said the host ; and for what ? to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes , returned albert .: 76.50
<S> during the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue , her mind required repose .: 104.21
<S> the idiot ! how so , if he loved her ? asked d artagnan .: 28.42
<S> i don t understand , said porthos .: 7.81
<S> they had left the ile ratonneau , where the lighthouse stood , on the right , and were now opposite the point des catalans .: 47.89
<S> today is the 30th .: 75.67
<S> not at all , my dear sir , said la carconte in her most gracious manner .: 13.35
<S> he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead , courage in the dark eye and bent brow , and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth .: 99.42
<S> a keeper , replied grimaud .: 26.60
<S> what , is it you , edmond , back again ? said he , with a broad marseillaise accent , and a grin that displayed his ivory white teeth .: 43.54
<S> woman is sacred ; the woman one loves is holy . on yourself , then , unhappy man ; on yourself ? i am the only guilty person , am i not ? said maximilian .: 67.82
<S> in fact , he said , as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission , athos , for generosity , is a hero of romance ; porthos has an excellent disposition , but is easily influenced ; aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance , always illegible .: 69.68
<S> well , you rascal , what is it ?: 17.74
<S> yes , he said , there have been some who have suffered more than i have , but then they must have been martyrs at least . do you repent ? asked a deep , solemn voice , which caused danglars hair to stand on end .: 41.26
<S> unfortunately , the qualities of this horse were so well concealed under his strange colored hide and his unaccountable gait , that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh , the appearance of the aforesaid pony at meung which place he had entered about a quarter of an hour before , by the gate of beaugency produced an unfavorable feeling , which extended to his rider .: 70.89
<S> a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand .: 38.32
<S> as ten o clock was striking , d artagnan left m. de tre ville , who thanked him for his information , recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart , and returned to the saloon ; but at the foot of the stairs , d artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane .: 23.13
<S> on quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right , and entered the reception room .: 31.98
<S> this chance did , then , for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence .: 41.29
<S> you have two or three times mentioned a m. morrel , he said ; who was he ? the owner of the pharaon and patron of dante s. and what part did he play in this sad drama ? inquired the abbe .: 51.15
<S> he then called for his horses , drove to the chamber , and inscribed his name to speak against the budget .: 48.90
<S> the island of monte cristo thus , at length , by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny , dante s was about to secure the opportunity he wished for , by simple and natural means , and land on the island without incurring any suspicion .: 49.17
<S> athos went toward the house , while the mendicant , who had received his reward , left as fast as his legs could carry him .: 35.34
<S> emmanuel sighed , and summoned cocles .: 98.05
<S> danglars signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy .: 126.17
<S> on your brow i read despair your lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidings your hands tremble .: 222.56
<S> let me see , continued the stranger , i am one of your largest creditors . your bills , at least , are the first that will fall due . do you wish for time to pay ? a delay would save my honor , and consequently my life . how long a delay do you wish for ? morrel reflected .: 43.62
<S> the coadjutor alone obtained nothing .: 80.58
<S> that is a large sum .: 15.48
<S> everything , said he to raoul , shall be done as you desire ; but you will not stop to have your wound dressed ? oh , my wound mine tis nothing , replied the viscount ; it will be time to think about it when we next halt ; only have the goodness , should you see a cavalier who makes inquiries about a young man on a chestnut horse followed by a servant , to tell him , in fact , that you have seen me , but that i have continued my journey and intend to dine at mazingarbe and to stop at cambrin .: 52.78
<S> your mode of life as a smuggler , said he to me one day , will be the ruin of you ; if you get out , don t take it up again . but how , inquired i , am i to maintain myself and my poor sister ? a person , whose confessor i am , replied he , and who entertains a high regard for me , applied to me a short time since to procure him a confidential servant .: 43.52
<S> she opened it quickly and read : go this moment to the alle es de meilhan , enter the house no .: 59.18
<S> the fact was , in leaving notre dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the day .: 25.44
<S> by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death , and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented , he began to reflect on suicide .: 175.62
<S> you shall die . and she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing table , opened it with a feverish and trembling hand , drew from it a small poniard , with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade , and then threw herself with a bound upon d artagnan .: 44.88
<S> the unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack , and rude in the defence .: 54.12
<S> a fine thing , indeed ! grunted porthos .: 46.10
<S> impossible !: 26.49
<S> dante s told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking , and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another , without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one .: 41.09
<S> in his time they armed gentlemen , not disarmed them .: 93.71
<S> grimaud speaks .: 77.41
<S> you see , felton , the drama has gone through all the phases i named ; but be easy , no blood will flow . milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave felton an immediate and terrible proof of her courage .: 105.40
<S> sir , what gratitude i feel ! exclaimed the man with gray hair .: 35.05
<S> your friend s soul must stick tight to his body . were you there , then ? monsieur , i followed them from curiosity , so that i saw the combat without the combatants seeing me . and what took place ? oh !: 68.37
<S> the frenchman threw her a bouquet ; teresa returned it all this with the consent of the chief , who was in the carriage . what ? cried franz , was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants ? it was he who drove , disguised as the coachman , replied peppino .: 54.02
<S> she is amiable and well behaved . what is her name ? she was sent to me by someone of high rank , under the name of kitty .: 37.21
<S> italy : sinbad the sailor chapter 32 .: 113.49
<S> bonacieux dead , and d artagnan in a swoon .: 34.11
<S> when albert returned to his mother , he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair , the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle , fastened here and there to the drapery , and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures , showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom .: 62.11
<S> athos as a diplomatist .: 34.18
<S> he had almost forgotten his name and face , but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it , the face encircled by a beard , wearing the brown jacket , the bunch of keys , the jingling of which he still seemed to hear .: 43.42
<S> perhaps you think i shall abandon you , dear grandpapa , and that i shall forget you when i am married ? no . they told you , then , that m. d e pinay consented to our all living together ? yes . then why are you still vexed and grieved ? the old man s eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection .: 33.24
<S> the happiest thing that could occur to me , would be to die in my father s stead ; that would save us all . your mother would die of grief . my poor mother ! said albert , passing his hand across his eyes , i know she would ; but better so than die of shame . are you quite decided , albert ? yes ; let us go . but do you think we shall find the count at home ? he intended returning some hours after me , and doubtless he is now at home . they ordered the driver to take them to no .: 41.99
<S> he drew near to the window , and placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it , he drew it from his pocket and read it again ; but he had not been mistaken , the appointment was for ten o clock .: 22.35
<S> well , at twenty nine i saw valentine ; for two years i have loved her , for two years i have seen written in her heart , as in a book , all the virtues of a daughter and wife .: 39.71
<S> i will therefore fight in my doublet , like yourself . come , come , enough of such compliments ! cried porthos .: 28.10
<S> you should have allowed me to sleep .: 22.65
<S> four of the guards , who were constantly near the prisoner , assisted in picking up the tennis balls .: 43.42
<S> no accident has happened to him ? none , sir . and he lives ? still at the hotel of the great charlemagne . and passes his time ? sometimes with the queen of england , sometimes with madame de chevreuse .: 41.69
<S> the feast had been made ready on the second floor at la re serve , with whose arbor the reader is already familiar .: 51.47
<S> we loved sporting of all kinds better than anything ; so that he related to me how in the plains of the pampas the natives hunt the tiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to a distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such nicety ; but in face of the proof i was obliged to acknowledge the truth of the recital .: 100.62
<S> i undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do .: 76.39
<S> at this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow , a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart strings .: 70.65
<S> what injury has fernand mondego done you in betraying ali tepelini ? ah , madame , replied monte cristo , all this is an affair between the french captain and the daughter of vasiliki .: 45.16
<S> then he added , with a smile yet more terrible than his anger , it is true , then ; you do not deny it ! she moved forward .: 29.70
<S> i am come to fetch you , monsieur d artagnan . from whom ? his eminence sent me . tell my lord that i m going to sleep , and i advise him , as a friend , to do the same . his eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed , and wants you instantly . the devil take mazarin , who does not know when to sleep at the proper time .: 30.65
<S> this evening , especially , aramis was melancholy and thoughtful .: 45.00
<S> the horses will have a long night s rest , and at five o clock to morrow morning we can be again on the road . olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master , grumbling .: 48.92
<S> what , you do not know !: 18.21
<S> at ten o clock anne of austria had entered the king s room .: 11.04
<S> what i most loved after you , merce de s , was myself , my dignity , and that strength which rendered me superior to other men ; that strength was my life .: 59.58
<S> the bolt gave way and the door opened .: 33.03
<S> madame , said debray , it is nearly six months since we have been associated .: 22.03
<S> this way , gentlemen , this way ! he cried , directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out .: 39.73
<S> but know you who he was ? he used to be the headsman of bethune . you knew him ?: 46.91
<S> they have killed them , i think , and taken flight , carrying off their booty .: 60.26
<S> milady listened with the greatest attention , and yet it was easily to be perceived , whatever effort she made to conceal her impressions , that this recital was not agreeable to her .: 43.35
<S> monte cristo waited for the two who remained ; then , when they had passed , he brought up the rear , and on his face was a smile , which , if they could have understood it , would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter .: 31.01
<S> 27 guilbert de pixe re court , french dramatist 1773 1844 .: 323.66
<S> happily for him he has ceased to bear that name . and therefore , said d artagnan , resolved to be patient to the end , it is not aramis i seek , but the abbe d herblay .: 37.48
<S> at the expiration of an hour , felton tapped again .: 16.89
<S> the prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance ; and he favored this man the more as grimaud became the more and more odious to him .: 94.55
<S> it depends on you only . i listen i am waiting to hear . sir , the favor i have to ask of you is , not to call me mousqueton but mouston . since i have had the honor of being my lord s steward i have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me .: 77.99
<S> who is this groslow ? asked porthos .: 17.43
<S> the jailer , therefore , only grumbled .: 43.90
<S> ah , she cried , what a frightful dream ! villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream .: 23.00
<S> and now , your excellency , added he , allow me to repeat my apologies , and i hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred . no , my dear vampa , replied the count ; besides , you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way , that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them . 20214m gentlemen , added the chief , turning towards the young men , perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you ; but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit , wherever i may be , you shall be welcome . franz and albert bowed .: 38.27
<S> athos and aramis looked at him inquiringly .: 10.59
<S> there wasn t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor duc d enghien . well , said the marquise , it seems probable that , by the aid of the holy alliance , we shall be rid of napoleon ; and we must trust to the vigilance of m. de villefort to purify marseilles of his partisans .: 35.54
<S> alas , how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father s love .: 66.85
<S> why ? oh , nothing , but that he might get me out of this , if he were favorably inclined to me . you are probably nearer freedom than he is , so it will be your business to get him out . and , said the prisoner , what talk is there of war with spain ? with spain , no , answered d artagnan ; but paris . what do you mean ? cried rochefort .: 42.93
<S> the executioner opened his eyes , turned toward the young man and grasped his arm .: 15.81
<S> then the figure , from whom she could not detach her eyes , and who appeared more protecting than menacing , took the glass , and walking towards the night light held it up , as if to test its transparency .: 54.23
<S> at one of these encounters , accidentally or purposely , albert s mask fell off .: 68.11
<S> it will be happier , i think , than ours has been .: 48.24
<S> the count filled one glass , but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby colored liquid .: 65.18
<S> all i can say is , if ever i should get such a chance , the living should be my theme . 20143m and you will probably find your theme ill chosen . but , said albert , breaking in upon his discourse , never mind the past ; let us only remember the present .: 74.79
<S> here at least , said athos , pointing to the bastion , they will not come and disturb us . it appears to me , said d artagnan , with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery , that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore . where we should have been seen all four conferring together , so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council . yes , said aramis , athos is right : animadvertuntur in desertis . a desert would not have been amiss , said porthos ; but it behooved us to find it . there is no desert where a bird can not pass over one s head , where a fish can not leap out of the water , where a rabbit can not come out of its burrow , and i believe that bird , fish , and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal .: 45.78
<S> friends ! well , then , tell me at once what you want , that i may see if any arrangement be possible .: 41.64
<S> in this ledger was made out an exact balance sheet of his affairs .: 92.50
<S> but , said porthos , i think i have an idea , in my turn . silence for monsieur porthos s idea ! said aramis .: 19.03
<S> valentine , with a color still heightened by emotion , entered the room just after her parents had quitted it .: 66.91
<S> that was a superb throw , so i left off there . d artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his breast .: 47.62
<S> the prince assigned to every one his post .: 65.47
<S> the hand moved on with incredible rapidity , he seemed to see its motion .: 43.23
<S> yes you .: 76.47
<S> but fortunately the world is a sepulcher ; the men , and consequently the women , are but shadows , and love is a sentiment to which you cry , fie !: 59.64
<S> you are doubtless provided with pistols , gentlemen ?: 87.89
<S> in short , i see you to tell you that we must never see each other again . speak on , madame , speak on , queen , said buckingham ; the sweetness of your voice covers the harshness of your words .: 34.53
<S> this child lives , and someone knows it lives someone is in possession of our secret ; and since monte cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred , when that child could not be found , it is he who is in possession of our secret . just god , avenging god ! murmured madame danglars .: 64.17
<S> really , madame , he said , did i alarm you much ? oh , no , sir , she answered ; but you know , things impress us differently , according to the mood of our minds . villefort forced a laugh .: 34.12
<S> he resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the comte de rochefort , and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to london .: 24.37
<S> no , no , madame , said felton , only do not sing so loud , particularly at night . and at these words felton , feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner , rushed out of the room .: 30.21
<S> grimaud made the sign yes .: 97.87
<S> i felt his blood gush over my face , but i was intoxicated , i was delirious , and the blood refreshed , instead of burning me .: 48.55
<S> no , monsieur !: 12.81
<S> come , then , thou regenerate man , thou extravagant prodigal , thou awakened sleeper , thou all powerful visionary , thou invincible millionaire , once again review thy past life of starvation and wretchedness , revisit the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted , and where despair received thee .: 305.09
<S> monsieur , said m. de tre ville , we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other , and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair . i have no objection , replied m. de la tre mouille , but i warn you that i am well informed , and all the fault is with your musketeers . you are too just and reasonable a man , monsieur ! said tre ville , not to accept the proposal i am about to make to you . make it , monsieur , i listen . how is monsieur bernajoux , your esquire s relative ? why , monsieur , very ill indeed !: 31.40
<S> these gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy ; it would be just the same today , no doubt for since yesterday evening they have had plenty of time to send for a doctor . then , said felton , who became impatient , say yourself , madame , what treatment you wish followed . eh , how can i tell ?: 65.62
<S> the sound had not yet died away when signor pastrini himself entered .: 79.06
<S> athos followed them , then porthos , then aramis .: 47.72
<S> but are you well assured , sir ? lying behind the tent of lord leven , i raised it and saw all , heard all ! and when is this to be consummated ? to day this morning ; so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose ! to do what ?: 84.65
<S> is this the man ? asked the captain , who was attentively reading plutarch s life of alexander .: 48.30
<S> perhaps i shall stand in need of a back door for retreat . you think of everything . and you forget one thing . what ? to ask me if i want money . that s true .: 54.40
<S> then , wretched creature , then you tempted god a third time .: 126.30
<S> the others followed .: 45.85
<S> i wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling remorse !: 61.57
<S> they both dismounted , consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door , and disappeared in the garden .: 29.37
<S> nothing , absolutely nothing , at present , but quitting paris , as i told you , as soon as possible .: 29.73
<S> and the scotch ? they kept their word and never stirred , said mordaunt .: 81.03
<S> i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges ; but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders , everything must be sacrificed .: 66.79
<S> your eminence may perceive , continued athos , knitting his brow , for this sort of investigation began to annoy him , that we have not come out without our arms . and he showed the cardinal , with his finger , the four muskets piled near the drum , on which were the cards and dice .: 40.27
<S> yes , keen and cutting politeness .: 62.46
<S> we can not say ; but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly .: 60.69
<S> these men were shopkeepers , who had arms to lend to those who had none .: 60.15

<S> there , placed between two rivers on the borders of scotland , but still on english soil , the tents of a little army extended .: 81.52
<S> it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat ; they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore .: 28.33
<S> beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from rome ; the frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world .: 29.26
<S> are there not crimes for which the impalement of the turks , the augers of the persians , the stake and the brand of the iroquois indians , are inadequate tortures , and which are unpunished by society ?: 94.59
<S> edmond , said merce de s , i have but one word more to say to you . the count smiled bitterly .: 13.70
<S> you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough .: 55.00
<S> anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister , i lost no time in hastening to corsica , but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning , the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day .: 82.45
<S> bernouin alone knew a little more than the others .: 38.45

<S> arrived at the hotel it was not long before athos entered .: 45.44
<S> bonacieux , so much happiness is not in store for me ! then you comprehend it would be only a question of time , a sort of race , which should arrive first .: 47.43
<S> besides , that does not concern the home but the financial department .: 54.88
<S> the pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm , and she slowly withdrew it .: 66.25
<S> he had read in the countenances of luigi and teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him , and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold , which he offered to them .: 32.86
<S> the cardinal , then , was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him .: 31.11
<S> perhaps you would prefer being alone ? no , replied he ; i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock , as they say at the opera balls .: 63.96
<S> thirty five or thirty six , mother . so young , it is impossible , said merce de s , replying at the same time to what albert said as well as to her own private reflection .: 48.52
<S> the crowd , whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent , began to be tumultuous .: 55.55
<S> then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old ? said albert .: 37.53
<S> what is it ?: 9.11
<S> the same officer appeared .: 44.44
<S> but mark the distinction with which he is treated ; instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you , he is simply sentenced to be guillotined , by which means , too , the amusements of the day are diversified , and there is a spectacle to please every spectator . without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with . my good friend , said the man in the cloak , excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act . perhaps i am ; but one thing i have resolved on , and that is , to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty , who has got into this scrape solely from having served me .: 82.16
<S> d artagnan and athos looked at each other for some time in silence .: 12.34

<S> horror ! cried d artagnan .: 11.76
<S> this voice made everyone bow before it , resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat , by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance .: 155.23
<S> what have they done to you ? they did you not see what they did ? no . they laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in england .: 42.38
<S> a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascon s uneasiness .: 89.36
<S> however , what had you to say to me ? he resumed ; let us return to that subject . with pleasure , replied d artagnan ; i must , however , first frankly tell you that you must change your mode of life . how ? go into harness again , gird on your sword , run after adventures , and leave as in old times a little of your fat on the roadside . ah !: 56.56
<S> but now you are happy ? doubtless , replied the count , since no one hears me complain . and your present happiness , has it softened your heart ? my present happiness equals my past misery , said the count .: 52.82

<S> i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed , and i dared not turn around .: 70.37
<S> at the same moment a fearful hurrah ! rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads .: 59.08
<S> recollect that parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage between myself and mlle .: 180.55
<S> about what time ? why , about fifteen or eighteen days ago . exactly so . and yesterday evening he came again . yesterday evening ? yes , just before you came . my dear athos , we are enveloped in a network of spies .: 55.03
<S> the guard had , in fact , touched the cardinal in the tenderest point .: 44.62
<S> why is that gendarme there ? asked andrea of himself .: 37.95
<S> alas , faltered out the abbe , all is over with me .: 44.67
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> the others , attracted by curiosity , were already scattered in different parts of the house ; for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room , and that , at the same time , they would obtain a view of the rest of the building , of which monte cristo had created a palace .: 35.25
<S> you will find here , moreover , the young woman of whom i spoke , who is persecuted , no doubt , in consequence of some court intrigue .: 40.59
<S> i was thinking , my dear old friend , that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church , and now that you are an abbe you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer . tis true ; man , as you know , said aramis , is a strange animal , made up of contradictions .: 52.03
<S> he clapped his hands three times the ordinary signal of lovers ; but nobody replied to him , not even an echo .: 68.81
<S> fernand , more happy , but not more at his ease for i saw at this time he was in constant dread of edmond s return fernand was very anxious to get his wife away , and to depart himself .: 62.75
<S> athos , however , perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the queen .: 65.06
<S> tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold colored silk , embroidered with pearls ; while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair , of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue .: 44.79
<S> i saw a white figure , and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses , i heard my glass removed the same which is there now on the table . oh , dear mother , it was a dream . so little was it a dream , that i stretched my hand towards the bell ; but when i did so , the shade disappeared ; my maid then entered with a light . but she saw no one ? phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them .: 66.37
<S> this will be , added noirtier , with a smile , one means by which you may a second time save me , if the political balance should some day take another turn , and cast you aloft while hurling me down .: 73.86
<S> god of goodness !: 71.29
<S> i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me , and even to remain faithful to my memory .: 30.72
<S> behind this group walked the surgeon ; and behind the surgeon the door closed .: 48.09
<S> i take them , said d artagnan , for myself .: 15.34
<S> a man can easily be put out of the way there , then ; it is , indeed , the bagdad and bassora of the thousand and one nights .: 38.36

<S> fortunately , as d artagnan had thought , it was not dangerous .: 23.49
<S> they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman .: 91.61
<S> you know wine is a deceiver ; but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side , and hand in hand .: 80.96
<S> silence ! said the young woman , placing her hand upon his lips ; silence , and go the same way you came ! but where and when shall i see you again ? cried d artagnan .: 26.04
<S> he loi se ! he repeated .: 11.19
<S> you blackguard ! cried athos , going toward him , i ll cut your ears off ! at the same instant , four men , armed to the teeth , entered by side doors , and rushed upon athos .: 33.67
<S> at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword , and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer .: 42.48
<S> however , they left the castle behind ; that was the principal thing .: 64.57
<S> one can easily see it comes from a priest . gondy remained firm , and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done ; but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop .: 72.55
<S> i am sure , my dear albert , whatever may be your career , you will soon render that name illustrious .: 51.62
<S> i have promised to escort to the acade mie a greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera , and who relies on me to conduct her thither . adieu , then , sir , and do not forget the prescription . ah , in truth , madame , to do that i must forget the hour s conversation i have had with you , which is indeed impossible . monte cristo bowed , and left the house .: 41.35
<S> what matters really , not only to me , but to officers of justice and the king , is that an innocent man should languish in prison , the victim of an infamous denunciation , to die here cursing his executioners . you are very humble today , remarked the governor ; you are not so always ; the other day , for instance , when you tried to kill the turnkey . it is true , sir , and i beg his pardon , for he has always been very good to me , but i was mad . and you are not so any longer ? no ; captivity has subdued me i have been here so long . so long ? when were you arrested , then ? asked the inspector .: 43.63
<S> speak out , sir , said mordaunt .: 17.62
<S> however , accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian life a life of politeness , visiting , and introductions . monte cristo bowed without making any answer ; he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret , as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty .: 124.45
<S> the two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of pe re lachaise , where m. de villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family .: 24.26
<S> on the right and on the left of the road , which the dismal procession pursued , appeared a few low , stunted trees , which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour .: 104.41
<S> if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law .: 14.71
<S> how has this terrible past been recalled ? cried villefort ; how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts , where it was buried , to visit us now , like a phantom , whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame ? alas , said hermine , doubtless it is chance . chance ? replied villefort ; no , no , madame , there is no such thing as chance . oh , yes ; has not a fatal chance revealed all this ?: 54.54
<S> rospigliosi , quite set up with his new dignities , went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner .: 59.83
<S> what matters it about broussel it is a name , not a thing . mazarin , clever politician as he was , was for once mistaken ; broussel was a thing , not a name .: 78.12
<S> keep the purse for your lackeys . d artagnan put the purse into his pocket .: 22.81
<S> an h and an n , surmounted by a baron s coronet . by heaven , m. bertuccio , you make use of heraldic terms ; where did you study heraldry ? in your service , excellency , where everything is learned . go on , i am curious to know two things . what are they , your excellency ? what became of this little boy ?: 58.21
<S> they quitted paris , beholding it abandoned to extreme want , bordering on famine ; agitated by fear , torn by faction .: 258.39
<S> the religion i serve , the god i adore , were blasphemed because i called upon that religion and that god , but still i resisted .: 143.40
<S> when they opened the window , they saw the poor lad lying senseless , with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork .: 44.39
<S> he guessed something uncommon was passing among the living ; but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world , that he looked upon himself as dead .: 48.04
<S> tomorrow , for instance , he is going to spend the day and night there . are you sure of it ? he has invited me to dine there . there s a life for you , said caderousse ; a town house and a country house . that is what it is to be rich . and shall you dine there ? probably . when you dine there , do you sleep there ? if i like ; i am at home there . caderousse looked at the young man , as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart .: 27.49
<S> i am on the earth to punish , madame , he added , with a flaming glance ; any other woman , were it the queen herself , i would send to the executioner ; but to you i shall be merciful .: 41.82
<S> valentine ! said a low voice .: 24.90
<S> d artagnan , overcoming his repugnance to mordaunt , walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk .: 47.02
<S> well , these twelve thousand livres are his civil list , and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king .: 59.43
<S> during this time olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie ; the horses were also refreshed .: 52.01
<S> d artagnan s countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion ; he began to think he had to do with madmen .: 33.90
<S> does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo ? he comes possibly from the holy land , and one of his ancestors possessed calvary , as the mortemarts did the dead sea . i think i can assist your researches , said maximilian .: 65.68
<S> during the ligue , about which guitant was speaking just now , the people chanted nothing except the mass , so everything went to destruction .: 98.68
<S> i do not know , said the servant , but the housemaid is in mademoiselle valentine s room : perhaps she has emptied them . ask her , said morrel , translating noirtier s thought this time by his look .: 39.68
<S> he is badly off , very badly . we are in france , and i am spanish . so much the worse ; i had much rather you were french and myself also ; they would hate us both less . nevertheless , you consent ? yes , if the thing be possible . it is ; it is i who tell you so ; make preparations for departure . i !: 55.54
<S> pray come to my aid , madame ; do not these circumstances appeal to your memory ? no , indeed , replied madame de villefort ; and yet it appears to me , sir , that if i had met you anywhere , the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory . perhaps the count saw us in italy , said valentine timidly .: 31.42
<S> she loves him devilishly , he murmured .: 31.57
<S> but the king soon again became dull and indisposed ; his brow was not one of those that long remain clear .: 82.54
<S> leaving the church , a woman and a young girl dressed in black , the one as a widow and the other as an orphan , have re entered their cell .: 48.34
<S> the young people uttered a cry of joy , while maximilian raised his head , but let it fall again immediately .: 18.70
<S> i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned , put in the marechal .: 102.45
<S> i m not the man you take me for ; you are in captain rogers s post , are you not ?: 48.54
<S> difficult for kings to return to the capitals of their kingdoms .: 32.21
<S> i will show you the way back myself , said the captain ; that is the least honor that i can render to your excellency . and taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman , he preceded his guests , not as a servant who performs an act of civility , but like a king who precedes ambassadors .: 51.21
<S> it is not from mistrust that i request you to follow me , but for my security .: 31.84
<S> this battle won by me , the king will have no further resources in england or in scotland ; and if he is not captured or killed , he will endeavor to pass over into france to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and money .: 87.45
<S> ah , ah !: 8.65
<S> it is the truth , however .: 16.16
<S> then he placed her in the boat , and as he was going to set foot in it himself , athos handed him a sum of silver .: 37.77
<S> had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her , so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind , or at least have greatly astonished him .: 106.52
<S> she was talking with great animation with the stranger .: 37.12
<S> they led me away masked .: 110.97
<S> excuse me , sir , replied the notary ; on the contrary , the meaning of m. noirtier is quite evident to me , and i can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind . you do not wish me to marry m. franz d e pinay ? observed valentine .: 22.83
<S> ah , monsieur , said mousqueton , then you have come here only to awaken our regrets . i fear that is true , said d artagnan , in a low tone .: 16.16
<S> it was useless .: 11.94
<S> this man has often made me shudder ; and one day when we were viewing an execution , i thought i should faint , more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture , than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit . did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood ? asked beauchamp .: 48.27
<S> certainly , said andrea , i shall not overtake my friend , but i shall kill your horse , therefore i had better stop .: 37.15
<S> down one of the corridors , whose extent it was impossible to determine , rays of light were visible .: 84.78
<S> ask my beloved sister hayde e , who ever since our departure from france , has caused me to wait patiently for this happy day , while talking to me of you . you then love hayde e ? asked monte cristo with an emotion he in vain endeavored to dissimulate .: 52.33
<S> the king has no authority here ! answered a deep voice , which seemed to proceed from a cloud , so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of dust .: 39.60
<S> milady clarik received d artagnan ceremoniously .: 79.37
<S> this secret passage is still to be seen in the palais royal .: 34.28
<S> for you ?: 50.29
<S> planchet , said he .: 14.76
<S> they will not dare to refuse me then ; and i will return to paris , and will see you again , and will be happy for an instant .: 19.57
<S> laporte could not leave the louvre ; she had not a soul in the world in whom she could confide .: 39.13
<S> have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots ?: 76.19
<S> as he touched the ground , he opened his eyes .: 14.00
<S> and what is the news ? you should not ask a stranger , a foreigner , for news . i know it , but in asking for news , i mean , have you done anything for me ? had you commissioned me ? said monte cristo , feigning uneasiness .: 38.41
<S> yes , i understand , said valentine ; it is because you love me . the old man assented .: 15.22
<S> let me hear , then , said the count , who this deeply regretted son was ; for i always understood you were a bachelor . that was the general opinion , sir , said the major , and i yes , replied the count , and you confirmed the report .: 35.36
<S> what i know is , that , like a fool , a greater fool than he of whom i spoke just now , i mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen , with a beardless chin and slim waist , and who , just as i was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips , placed a pistol to my head , and , aided by seven or eight others , led , or rather dragged me , to the catacombs of st. sebastian , where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing c sar s commentaries , and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me , that unless the next morning , before six o clock , four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his banker s , at a quarter past six i should have ceased to exist .: 56.01
<S> it was a terrible moment for the young man .: 14.65
<S> fine sport ! are you still bent on departure , athos ? asked d artagnan .: 40.15
<S> he regrets the devil !: 59.83
<S> it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two powerful horses .: 50.54
<S> i am called louis the just , monsieur de tre ville , and by and by , by and by we will see . ah , sire ; it is because i confide in that justice that i shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your majesty . wait , then , monsieur , wait , said the king ; i will not detain you long . in fact , fortune changed ; and as the king began to lose what he had won , he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing charlemagne if we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance .: 67.84
<S> our breakfast is a philanthropic one , and we shall have at table at least , i hope so two benefactors of humanity . what shall we do ? said debray ; we have only one monthyon prize . well , it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it , said beauchamp ; that is the way the academy mostly escapes from the dilemma . and where does he come from ? asked debray .: 37.81
<S> at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage , which , instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue fe rou , drove up to the green door .: 18.58
<S> once out to sea , you are too good a politician not to understand the rest , mordaunt . yes , they would have all been blown up . just so .: 67.15
<S> athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room , as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings .: 31.38
<S> see paragraph 1.c below .: 25.68
<S> he told him his birth , his position , his fortune , and more than once , when he consulted the look of the paralytic , that look answered , that is good , proceed . and now , said morrel , when he had finished the first part of his recital , now i have told you of my love and my hopes , may i inform you of my intentions ? yes , signified the old man .: 35.84
<S> years rolled on , and amongst the descendants some were soldiers , others diplomatists ; some churchmen , some bankers ; some grew rich , and some were ruined .: 240.78
<S> at nine o clock madame la premie re pre sidente arrived .: 71.12
<S> ah , what else is there ? said danglars ; for , at present , i can not say that i have seen anything extraordinary .: 20.88
<S> i can scarcely credit it . nevertheless , it is quite true ; still , i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way , and calls for immediate correction ; but , in all probability , i should have performed so important , so necessary a duty , as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital , had i known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world , but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there , and , of necessity , was compelled to abandon the idea . so distinguished an individual as yourself , cried albert , could scarcely have required an introduction . you are most kind ; but as regards myself , i can find no merit i possess , save that , as a millionaire , i might have become a partner in the speculations of m. aguado and m. rothschild ; but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks , i stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution .: 72.30
<S> there was a study for emmanuel , who never studied , and a music room for julie , who never played .: 84.02

<S> bonacieux from the convent of the carmelites of be thune .: 24.61
<S> however , we have them safe in prison , and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it convenient .: 45.83
<S> so important a negotiation should , i think , be conducted by the respective fathers of the young people . sir , my father is a man of great foresight and prudence .: 43.95
<S> but his son came in .: 48.07
<S> my poor friend ! resumed d artagnan , not having seen you for four or five years i concluded you were dead . i faith , said rochefort , there s no great difference , i think , between a dead man and one who has been buried alive ; now i have been buried alive , or very nearly so . and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile . do you wish me to speak the truth ? yes . well , then , i don t know . have you any suspicion of me , rochefort ? no !: 31.44
<S> upon my return home i sent for him , and i then explained to him what i wished to procure .: 34.45
<S> oh , yes , she exclaimed , i recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much , and seemed to ease my aching brain .: 55.65
<S> m. danglars appeared ; debray reseated himself .: 66.87
<S> the abbe told us it was worth 50,000 without the setting . what was the abbe s name ? asked the indefatigable questioner .: 36.95
<S> she was charming .: 35.60
<S> not with us , sir , replied dante s .: 16.66
<S> there remained in the banker s house only danglars , closeted in his study , and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes ; madame danglars , terrified , in the boudoir with which we are acquainted ; and euge nie , who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion , mademoiselle louise d armilly .: 60.89
<S> oh , i repeat it , edmond ; what you have just done is beautiful it is grand ; it is sublime . do you say so now , merce de s ? then what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice i make to you ?: 39.53
<S> it is the insect with black claws , and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance . go then ; for in the course of two hours it will be dark , and you will not be able to see anything . ma foi ! you frighten me .: 46.05
<S> one day he was surprised in a lonely road between a huguenot and a catholic , with both of whom he had before had business , and who both knew him again ; so they united against him and hanged him on a tree .: 63.49
<S> at the end of five hundred paces , more or less , they came to a rivulet , which they forded .: 30.15
<S> i am mistaken ? monsieur de mazarin will not come to visit the comte de la fere , but the comte de la fere will be sent for to visit him . no , no , no , said comminges , who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were , i clearly understood what the cardinal said to me .: 25.83
<S> in a few minutes a night watch passed .: 36.76
<S> he was naked , with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath , and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge hammer .: 48.69
<S> have you , monsieur le gascon ? asked mazarin , supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands .: 25.56
<S> about two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight .: 42.81
<S> it is he who has raised all this revolt . the more reason , said mazarin ; if he has raised it he can put it down . and hold , madame , suggested comminges , who was near a window , out of which he could see ; hold , the moment is a happy one , for there he is now , giving his blessing in the square of the palais royal . the queen sprang to the window .: 41.56
<S> at nine o clock , guided by planchet , the little cavalcade set out , taking the route the carriage had taken .: 37.33
<S> look well at me ! said monte cristo , putting the light near his face .: 28.41
<S> no misfortune has happened to the queen ? cried buckingham , the instant he came up , throwing all his fear and love into the question .: 68.31
<S> his conversation was a matter of fact , without a single romance .: 60.76
<S> i felt myself fall to the ground , my mother had fainted . hayde e s arms fell by her side , and she uttered a deep groan , at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands .: 31.23
<S> i believe these fellows have managed their business .: 48.49
<S> she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge ; she had returned to the catalans , and had despairingly cast herself on her couch .: 21.48
<S> i remembered him well .: 34.52
<S> take it , said she , and be accursed ! athos took the paper , returned the pistol to his belt , approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper , unfolded it , and read : dec .: 34.60
<S> what is that ? said he ; whence comes that cry ? from the wounded man s room , replied the host .: 26.24
<S> row ! said he to the sailors .: 24.84
<S> whenever this occurred , although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen , anne looked at d artagnan anxiously .: 76.26
<S> i was obliged to brand the guilty one ; and he , gentlemen , was my brother !: 36.21
<S> why , she did not know , but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited .: 32.60
<S> felton cast his eyes round for means of escape , and seeing the door free , he rushed into the next chamber , in which , as we have said , the deputies from la rochelle were waiting , crossed it as quickly as possible , and rushed toward the staircase ; but upon the first step he met lord de winter , who , seeing him pale , confused , livid , and stained with blood both on his hands and face , seized him by the throat , crying , i knew it !: 31.59
<S> the chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs , while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade .: 158.39
<S> in passing before d artagnan he recognized his former master .: 42.61
<S> a piece of bread was brought , and jacopo offered him the gourd .: 34.00
<S> the day has been unfortunate , but it is not your fault , thank god !: 26.71
<S> at three paces from her , seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs , leaning his elbow on an old worm eaten table , was a tall young man of twenty , or two and twenty , who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled .: 51.44
<S> everything is ready , is it not ? yes . the cargo on board ? yes . five full casks ? and fifty empty ones . good . we are carrying port wine to anvers . excellent .: 107.22
<S> you are taking a poetical tone , and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening .: 90.09
<S> god gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you ; in the name of that god i act , remember that , wretch , and to spare thee at this moment is still serving him . oh ! said caderousse , groaning with pain .: 57.85
<S> truly , sir , you overwhelm me with benefits ! therefore you love me a little , i hope , replied athos , in a tone of emotion .: 21.01
<S> dante s redoubled his efforts ; he seemed like one of the ancient titans , who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods .: 51.77
<S> what interest have they in your death ?: 62.40
<S> at sight of this man , d artagnan started , and half drawing his sword , sprang toward the door .: 16.73
<S> i come in the name of our master , ali tepelini . if you come from ali himself , said selim , you know what you were charged to remit to me ? yes , said the messenger , and i bring you his ring . at these words he raised his hand above his head , to show the token ; but it was too far off , and there was not light enough to enable selim , where he was standing , to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view .: 43.21
<S> every one grows childish in prison , but the character of monsieur de beaufort was particularly disposed to become so .: 62.98
<S> he promised to be back by eight o clock , and eight is striking .: 33.34
<S> here , said he , to cucumetto , here are three hundred piastres ; give me back my child .: 22.66
<S> i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can , and fulfil my promise to the dying man .: 25.31
<S> he ran up the steps , entered the church , and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel , asked him if he knew monsieur bazin .: 63.32
<S> one thing alone , however , threw a shade over the pallid brow of felton .: 44.29
<S> and aramis ; i see you have not forgotten the name . no , she said ; poor aramis ; a charming man , elegant , discreet , and a writer of poetical verses .: 55.43
<S> well ! resumed the catalan , as he saw the final glimmer of caderousse s reason vanishing before the last glass of wine .: 59.00
<S> athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves ; the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea .: 68.11
<S> the place royale be it so ! replied athos .: 53.98
<S> yes , my lord , the pure parliament . what do you mean by the pure parliament ?: 31.83
<S> since you appear to know so many things , can you tell me what is become of that woman ? i presume that she has returned to tours . to tours ?: 34.30
<S> she sighed , as she looked at him .: 17.17
<S> diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence , and laid rita at the captain s feet .: 77.10
<S> that is it , is it not , monseigneur , and i shall have nothing else to do ? that is it , replied the cardinal , dryly .: 16.48
<S> there is a congestion of prisoners in the bastile , who were cooped up in the time of monsieur de richelieu ; i don t even know their names . yes , but in regard to myself , my lord , it can not be so , for i was removed from the chatelet to the bastile owing to an order from your eminence . you think you were . i am certain of it . ah , stay !: 35.16
<S> do you not know that all paris knew it yesterday , and the day before it had already transpired on the bourse , and m. danglars i do not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do made a million ! and you another order , for i see you have a blue ribbon at your button hole . yes ; they sent me the order of charles iii. , returned debray carelessly .: 57.61
<S> yes , mademoiselle , you especially , replied the doctor abruptly .: 38.93
<S> it was planchet , who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of piedmont .: 50.19
<S> he offered his hand to the baroness , who , descending , took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but monte cristo .: 33.44
<S> i was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence , and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table .: 37.77
<S> oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance , and a low born fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them .: 77.91
<S> on !: 53.45
<S> in the name of heaven ! cried he , listen to me ; i have been waiting for someone who has not come .: 14.59
<S> he traversed a corridor , crossed a grand saloon , entered a library , and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing .: 35.37
<S> at that moment parry turned over several leaves of his bible and read with a loud voice this verse in jeremiah : god said , hear ye the words of the prophets my servants , whom i have sent unto you . the four friends exchanged glances .: 90.64
<S> parry bent over his master s hand and kissed it respectfully .: 32.92
<S> well , said he , but you had another subject for your thoughts ; did you not say so just now ? i did ! you have told me as yet but one of them let me hear the other . it was this , that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life , you were perfectly unacquainted with mine . your life , my young friend , has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events . it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune .: 55.00
<S> the only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at once .: 35.08
<S> leave him with me , replied the duchess .: 16.98
<S> ah , i understand , said the lieutenant ; and you seek admittance into our ranks ? welcome ! cried several bandits from ferrusino , pampinara , and anagni , who had recognized luigi vampa .: 50.93
<S> the conditions are favorable ; what else was opera invented for ? no , thank you .: 99.18
<S> scarcely had he shut her door , when merce de s called a confidential servant , and ordered him to follow albert wherever he should go that evening , and to come and tell her immediately what he observed .: 44.99
<S> and what is that ? that of being your invalid , answered scarron .: 40.20
<S> bonacieux had disappeared , without his being able to discover what had become of her .: 24.59
<S> the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away .: 55.39
<S> they listened ; he went into his sleeping room , and fastened the door inside .: 35.08
<S> well then , your eminence , said the queen , becoming impatient , what is your answer ? madame , cried mazarin , more and more moved , will your majesty permit me to give you counsel ? speak , sir , replied the queen ; the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available . madame , believe me , the king ought to defend himself to the last . he has done so , sir , and this last battle , which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy , proves that he will not yield without a struggle ; but in case he is beaten ? well , madame , in that case , my advice i know that i am very bold to offer advice to your majesty my advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom .: 38.99
<S> my affianced husband returned .: 85.22
<S> i really believe you are a man , and a violent one , too . and you , you are a woman a miserable woman , stupid and brutal .: 41.36
<S> faith , sir , said raoul , smiling , although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair , you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me .: 46.58
<S> yes ; a little nervous , perhaps , but , upon the whole , he appeared tolerable .: 64.49
<S> the safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse .: 72.62
<S> the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san felice s steward , and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome , were expended in ear rings , necklaces , and gold hairpins .: 84.57
<S> d artagnan and athos refused them .: 17.06
<S> was that all he said ? inquired athos .: 27.71
<S> i am about , perhaps , to discover something here ; i am in the vein . she tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor .: 51.60
<S> and , as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper , whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing , it was situated between the rho ne from which it had its source and the post road it had depleted , not a hundred steps from the inn , of which we have given a brief but faithful description .: 108.78
<S> ah , said the captain , we have still too much canvas set ; all hands lower the mainsail ! five minutes after , it was down ; and we sailed under mizzen topsails and top gallant sails .: 126.70
<S> truly , this is an indignity ! be kind enough to pardon me , madame ; but in this circumstance i am but the instrument which the king employs .: 62.38
<S> no , indeed ; the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected .: 74.99
<S> luigi was jealous !: 143.75
<S> the chateau ! he said to himself , what chateau ?: 37.05
<S> volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg s goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg collection will remain freely available for generations to come .: 27.40
<S> but will you be able to follow me ? oh , yes ! your wound ? gives me pain , but will not prevent my walking . be ready , then , at the first signal . milady shut the window , extinguished the lamp , and went , as felton had desired her , to lie down on the bed .: 44.87
<S> come , if so you will , count , and continue this conversation at my house , any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you , and i will show you my father , m. noirtier de villefort , one of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution ; that is to say , he had the most remarkable audacity , seconded by a most powerful organization a man who has not , perhaps , like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth , but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest ; in fact , a man who believed himself , like you , one of the envoys , not of god , but of a supreme being ; not of providence , but of fate .: 47.80
<S> cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity .: 78.00
<S> the devil ! thought porthos , this is poor work .: 35.60
<S> planchet , who had been the first to enter , was the last to leave .: 18.73
<S> in this place were together 60,000 pouches and 200 barrels ; the pouches contained 25,000,000 of money in gold , and the barrels were filled with 30,000 pounds of gunpowder .: 62.12
<S> this was the room appropriated to the sailors .: 29.90
<S> is that you , dear friend ? exclaimed porthos .: 14.32
<S> you were among the first who tasted any of my dishes , and i think you relished them tolerably . while speaking , caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions .: 130.52
<S> a black point floated on the sea .: 42.73
<S> villefort , thunderstruck , fell upon his knees ; the child dropped from his arms , and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother .: 27.11
<S> did edmond make you his heir ? no , merely his testamentary executor .: 100.17
<S> unfortunately , said athos , he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities united . but where is such a lackey to be found ? not to be found ! cried athos .: 75.92
<S> therefore , when , at dessert , upon a sign from d artagnan , porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone : porthos , said d artagnan , who will attend you in your campaigns ? why , replied porthos , mouston , of course . this was a blow to d artagnan .: 25.39
<S> i furnished myself with a light . you did ?: 58.38
<S> what are you doing ? you have wounded me to the heart . never mind it , for i see you once more , said the old man ; and now it s all over everything is all right again . 0035m yes , here i am , said the young man , with a promising future and a little money .: 36.91
<S> it fills me with pride to find that , thanks to a common sort of penetration with which i am endowed , i am approved by a man like you , fresh from the court . but you speak of him , not of his party , his resources . it is true the queen is for him . something in his favor . but he will never have the king . a mere child . a child who will be of age in four years .: 51.32
<S> he resolved not to reach noisy in the day , for fear of being recognized ; he had therefore plenty of time before him , for noisy is only three or four leagues from paris , on the road to meaux .: 44.42
<S> yes , i will reduce this rebellious city to ashes .: 98.11
<S> your name is celebrated , your position magnificent ; and then the comte de morcerf is a soldier , and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a bayard united to the poverty of a duguesclin ; disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine .: 63.35
<S> how is that ? you asked me for five hundred men , did you not ?: 22.17
<S> monte cristo leaned against a tree , and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived , looked up and down the avenue , examined the passers by , and carefully looked down the neighboring streets , to see that no one was concealed .: 42.09
<S> i guess what brings you here . how , and why ? because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same subject . by whom ? by a banker of paris , my correspondent . whose name is danglars . he ! cried albert ; yes , it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred .: 55.12
<S> well , before dying , i wish to see my son in law .: 20.89
<S> they must be enemies . he is right , said porthos ; battle .: 36.86
<S> between honest men such excessive precaution is , i think , quite unnecessary . yes , so it is , between perfectly upright people . one word more , said monte cristo .: 77.92
<S> gentlemen , said athos , she is alone within half a league of us , in the direction of the river . that s well , said d artagnan .: 14.59
<S> but i tell you that i am the mistress of the house , gentlemen !: 16.94
<S> oh , meddle in nothing which concerns me .: 85.84
<S> where on the balcony ? not at all , madame , but here , sleeping in his bed . oh , your majesty , exclaimed laporte , monsieur d artagnan is right . the queen became thoughtful and smiled , like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger .: 39.19
<S> weak or strong , repeated milady , that man has , then , a spark of pity in his soul ; of that spark i will make a flame that shall devour him .: 67.79
<S> d artagnan believed this cough to be a signal .: 41.02
<S> charge ! cried porthos .: 23.65
<S> notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme .: 95.38
<S> edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content ; the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased ; his thirst had abated ; when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will o the wisps that play about the marshes .: 169.45
<S> speak . that your eminence will go at once to the queen . what for ? merely to say these words : i am going to send monsieur d artagnan away and i wish him to set out directly . i told you , said mazarin , that you had seen the queen . i had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake . what is the meaning of that ? may i venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence ? very well ; i will go .: 26.68
<S> sir , said d artagnan , how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side ? no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers . well , that is scarcely the question .: 38.32
<S> he is a subtle , conscienceless italian , who though he very likely dreams of crime , dares not commit it ; and unlike cromwell , who disposes of both houses , mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament . more reason , then , he should protect a king pursued by parliament . the queen shook her head despairingly .: 105.83
<S> what do you want with me ? said she , and why do you place your hand on me ? i thought that madame was ill , and i wished to bring her help , responded the maid , frightened at the terrible expression which had come over her mistress s face .: 27.20
<S> on the way we escaped .: 71.06
<S> you assert a great deal , said mazarin .: 16.68
<S> princes must be knocked on the head . i remember it , said athos .: 32.25
<S> his majesty , i can assure you , will be tried on his arrival in london ; i have heard enough from the lips of oliver cromwell to know what to expect . a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis .: 45.83
<S> i did not mention that , because the signature seemed to me so strange . the letter signed sinbad the sailor , is it not ? exactly so .: 31.68
<S> has any horse got loose ? not likely , answered the gascon ; these marks are regular . where is raoul ? asked athos ; how is it that i have not seen him ? hush ! exclaimed d artagnan , putting his finger on his lips ; and he related what he had seen , watching athos all the while .: 33.68
<S> it is likely , he replied , that we shall soon be obliged to separate , unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy . why , cried the queen ; how is that ? because , as they say in the opera of thisbe , the whole world conspires to break our bonds . you jest , sir ! answered the queen , endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity .: 36.34
<S> there is in london , i hope , some establishment like that of the magdalens , or of the repentant daughters .: 56.83
<S> who sent you ? come , come , you are going on quickly , m. benedetto ! yes , and to the point .: 36.11
<S> but i feel very deeply that this fish which i go and sell , and with the produce of which i buy the flax i spin , i feel very keenly , fernand , that this is charity . and if it were , merce de s , poor and lone as you are , you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of marseilles !: 53.12
<S> smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised .: 117.10
<S> we will talk italian and spanish .: 87.04
<S> on the ground floor , dining room , two drawing rooms , billiard room , staircase in the hall , and a little back staircase . windows ? magnificent windows , so beautiful , so large , that i believe a man of your size should pass through each frame . why the devil have they any stairs with such windows ? luxury has everything . but shutters ? yes , but they are never used .: 106.78
<S> yes , my friend . a presentation ?: 27.38
<S> porthos fired ; the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of battle .: 57.19
<S> if an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the united states and you are located in the united states , we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying , distributing , performing , displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed .: 15.41
<S> follow me , said morrel ; i will take you to my sister , who is worthy also to be yours .: 21.47
<S> zounds ! exclaimed porthos , tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the stomach . and he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and meat .: 155.14
<S> the disappearance of mazarin was not as yet generally known .: 59.25
<S> five minutes afterward they knocked at the prince s door .: 20.87
<S> only , leave him in the ante room , as i wish to speak to you alone . d artagnan bowed , and thought : both at the same hour ; both commands alike ; both at the palais royal .: 42.32
<S> the count knit his brow .: 21.38
<S> oh , said monte cristo , i allow of no excuse .: 25.15
<S> the first four furloughs granted , as may be imagined , were to our four friends .: 58.98
<S> i have nothing to save for your majesty ; you are only the victim of perfidious plots . that is true , that is true , my child , said the queen , you are right . give me then , that letter , madame ; time presses . the queen ran to a little table , on which were ink , paper , and pens .: 26.26
<S> but fernand , instead of responding to this amiable gesture , remained mute and trembling .: 36.99
<S> go to work , labor , young man , struggle ardently and courageously ; live , yourself , your mother and sister , with the most rigid economy , so that from day to day the property of those whom i leave in your hands may augment and fructify .: 91.23
<S> when you arrive at the first step of the church of san giacomo , be sure to fasten a knot of rose colored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume , in order that you may be recognized .: 43.71
<S> in fact , in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind happened ; but buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became of those he had knocked down .: 47.66
<S> the traveller descended , and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat , which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation , stood up with his arms crossed .: 35.54
<S> will you let me be killed ?: 17.76
<S> you have been to sea ? yes ; i have just made a little excursion to the borromean islands18 . what of that ?: 44.09
<S> do you hear anything ? said she .: 10.13
<S> it is true that since i left him , i seem to have lost my senses .: 19.67
<S> dante s was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria , who had remained in edmond s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope ladder , call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering .: 56.75
<S> it is closed after them , and they are arrested ; so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the habitue s of the establishment .: 31.85
<S> never shall i forget your sublime courage , when , having returned to consciousness , i dragged myself to the foot of the stairs , and you , almost dying yourself , came to meet me .: 55.29
<S> bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead .: 70.87
<S> lips of stone turned to flame , breasts of ice became like heated lava , so that to franz , yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug , love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture , as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips , and he was held in cool serpent like embraces .: 157.83
<S> speak , speak ! take this letter , said d artagnan .: 14.44
<S> the snow was falling thick and icy .: 77.50
<S> so it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted , and la ramee was in consequence placed near him as taster .: 91.36
<S> and now , said the youths , we have done all we can for you ; and as we are in haste to rejoin the prince s army we must continue our journey .: 27.67
<S> between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass .: 65.97
<S> in fact , the sack of la rochelle , and the assassination of three of four thousand huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed , would resemble too closely , in 1628 , the massacre of st. bartholomew in 1572 ; and then , above all this , this extreme measure , which was not at all repugnant to the king , good catholic as he was , always fell before this argument of the besieging generals la rochelle is impregnable except to famine .: 80.36
<S> thanks , said the latter , closing the register with a slam , i have all i want ; now it is for me to perform my promise .: 29.05
<S> persons whom i do not like ! yes , indeed .: 41.59
<S> once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two post horses .: 126.68
<S> you will allow me to leave first ; then , after half an hour , you can go away in your turn . yes , monseigneur .: 18.56
<S> you very well know , porthos , that i continue to study theology for that purpose . he will be one , as he says , cried porthos ; he will be one , sooner or later . sooner , said aramis .: 37.71
<S> what are you doing ? asked rochefort .: 7.00
<S> at the moment he re entered , the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening , curious as to what the king was doing .: 35.25
<S> then , when the cardinal had ended : alas , sir !: 28.28
<S> yes , said cromwell ; you have done , since i knew you , not only your duty , but more than your duty ; you have been a faithful friend , a cautious negotiator , a brave soldier . do you remember , sir it was my idea , the scotch treaty , for giving up the king ? yes , the idea was yours .: 45.82
<S> at five o clock albert returned , delighted with his day s work ; he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction , and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept ; besides this , he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome .: 70.55
<S> this time , without knowing why , d artagnan felt a cold shiver run through his veins .: 22.62
<S> consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron franz d e pinay , because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make , and , in short , because i choose to bestow my daughter s hand on whomever i please . what ? said the count , the approbation of whose eye villefort had frequently solicited during this speech .: 48.75
<S> it was said that madame de longueville , for whom the prince had more than a brother s affection and in whom he had confided , had been indiscreet .: 27.00
<S> i hope so . the friends embraced cordially ; d artagnan pressed raoul s hand .: 37.07
<S> she married the man she loved , who remained faithful to us in our fallen fortunes emmanuel herbaut . monte cristo smiled imperceptibly .: 131.70
<S> go ; i will reflect . gondy looked at mazarin , astonished , and mazarin approached the queen to speak to her , but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the palais royal .: 25.95
<S> close to him , dressed in entirely new clothes , advanced smilingly count andrea cavalcanti , the dutiful son , whom we also know .: 112.63
<S> i would not go at all , said aramis .: 13.23
<S> it is not only a valuable diamond , but it is an enchanted talisman . i don t at all understand you , but i believe all you say to be true .: 38.80
<S> athos was invited four times , and each time took his friends and their lackeys with him .: 43.05
<S> bonacieux could hardly hear what she said , to my lord duke of buckingham , london . the letter shall be given to himself . generous girl ! cried anne of austria .: 44.61
<S> we are not generally very severe with the austrians .: 49.91
<S> i say , sire , that there is now but one way open .: 39.28
<S> during the daytime valentine s perceptions remained tolerably clear , owing to the constant presence of m. noirtier , who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughter s room , and watched her with his paternal tenderness ; villefort also , on his return from the law courts , frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child .: 55.02
<S> to be sure ; besides , every millionaire is as noble as a bastard that is , he can be . do not say that , debray , returned beauchamp , laughing , for here is cha teau renaud , who , to cure you of your mania for paradoxes , will pass the sword of renaud de montauban , his ancestor , through your body . he will sully it then , returned lucien ; for i am low very low . oh , heavens , cried beauchamp , the minister quotes be ranger , what shall we come to next ? m .: 58.86
<S> as for benedetto , he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket handkerchief .: 57.27
<S> why do you sing thus , and with such a voice ? said he .: 30.34
<S> well , this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house . well , baron , what is there difficult to understand about that ? merely the term unlimited nothing else , certainly . is not that word known in france ?: 70.85
<S> it is true we plundered them a little when we took them , and i will even confess that it is their purse that monsieur du vallon and i draw on in our nightly play .: 63.53
<S> monsieur de longueville is of royal blood , madame , said d artagnan .: 19.10
<S> come hither , monsieur . d artagnan , who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed , approached , assuming a most deprecating air .: 41.41
<S> it was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes , fingers placed upon the lips , little assassinating smiles , which really did assassinate the disdained beauty .: 107.49
<S> what can you expect ? replied aramis , in a tone of resignation .: 10.58
<S> yes , my prince ; but listen .: 23.67
<S> my dear d artagnan , said aramis , don t be too angry with me , i beg .: 12.68
<S> the rest of mademoiselle euge nie s person was in perfect keeping with the head just described ; she , indeed , reminded one of diana , as cha teau renaud observed , but her bearing was more haughty and resolute .: 69.72
<S> bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the plain st. denis or in the fair of st. germain , in company with athos , porthos , and aramis , to whom d artagnan had often remarked this .: 48.74
<S> during this short time valentine must have held her breath , or moved in some slight degree , for the woman , disturbed , stopped and leaned over the bed , in order the better to ascertain whether valentine slept : it was madame de villefort .: 59.85
<S> then , rising , he went out , and meeting a servant on the stairs , he asked : where is m. de villefort ? the servant , instead of answering , pointed to the garden .: 24.22
<S> dear d artagnan !: 15.38
<S> why the devil do you rouse me at this hour ? to tell you that you are free , your excellency . my dear fellow , replied albert , with perfect ease of mind , remember , for the future , napoleon s maxim , never awaken me but for bad news ; if you had let me sleep on , i should have finished my galop , and have been grateful to you all my life .: 35.15
<S> uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present .: 64.37
<S> no , no !: 9.69
<S> well , did anybody ever dream of calling aramis a coward ?: 95.34
<S> madame de longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm ; she was also one of the greatest beauties at court .: 34.37
<S> the brigadier had a moment s hope .: 26.97
<S> for my part , observed aramis , i can not say the same as you do , porthos .: 17.82
<S> coquenard , she could not restrain her tears ; but no evil impressions were taken from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives , about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with her husband .: 50.42
<S> i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error . well , then , if it be so , are you ready , albert ? perfectly . let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy . yes , let us do so . the landlord preceded the friends across the landing , which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count , rang at the bell , and , upon the door being opened by a servant , said : i signori francesi . the domestic bowed respectfully , and invited them to enter .: 42.80
<S> let us come to some conclusion .: 29.28
<S> women say those things , but never do them . you do not know merce de s ; what she threatens she will do . idiot ! muttered danglars ; whether she kill herself or not , what matter , provided dante s is not captain ? before merce de s should die , replied fernand , with the accents of unshaken resolution , i would die myself ! that s what i call love ! said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever .: 57.60
<S> true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know , d artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of raoul .: 69.09
<S> alone ? asked d artagnan .: 11.78
<S> he found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body , agitated by feverish shudders .: 78.86
<S> for the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance , in order to watch the shore of the mediterranean .: 43.20
<S> did you not observe his despair on the journey ?: 35.67
<S> i was like you , and had a king in keeping . aha ! said groslow ; what king ? our own , to be sure , the little one louis xiv . and how long had you to take care of him ? three nights ; and , by my troth , i shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure . how do you mean ? i mean that my friends , officers in the guards and mousquetaires , came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting , drinking , dicing . ah true , said the englishman , with a sigh ; you frenchmen are born boon companions . and don t you play , too , when you are on guard ? never , said the englishman .: 50.43
<S> however , recovering my strength and my ideas , why , said i , should that man have carried away the corpse ? but you said , replied madame danglars , he would require it as a proof . ah , no , madame , that could not be .: 49.45
<S> sire , said aramis , will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this ? friends ! answered charles , sadly , i have but three one of twenty years , who has never forgotten me , and two of a week s standing , whom i shall never forget .: 47.71
<S> villefort s impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead , and franz was stupefied .: 55.82
<S> only warn him that it is you . why should i do that ? because , monsieur , some mischief might happen to you . of what kind , in the name of wonder ? monsieur porthos may imagine you belong to the house , and in a fit of passion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains . what have you done to him , then ? we have asked him for money . the devil !: 42.99
<S> his feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects , and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak , half lost in the shadow of a stone column .: 42.95
<S> his first visit was to aramis , at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed mme .: 32.35
<S> what the devil are you doing ? by jove , i am falling , or rather , bayard is falling , answered porthos .: 23.92
<S> no .: 17.05
<S> yes , sir . who is it ? a woman , accompanied by a servant . everyone looked at his neighbor .: 25.49
<S> no , he murmured , none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time , that they might now come and crush me with this secret .: 61.13
<S> an unexpected incident , in the affair of murder and theft at the count of monte cristo s , in which he nearly fell a victim , deprives us of the pleasure of seeing m. de villefort . indeed ? said m. danglars , in the same tone in which he would have said , oh , well , what do i care ? as a matter of fact , said monte cristo , approaching , i am much afraid that i am the involuntary cause of his absence . what , you , count ? said madame danglars , signing ; if you are , take care , for i shall never forgive you . andrea pricked up his ears .: 33.52
<S> in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared , and dante s could see an oaken coffer , bound with cut steel ; in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate , which was still untarnished , the arms of the spada family viz. , a sword , en pale , on an oval shield , like all the italian armorial bearings , and surmounted by a cardinal s hat .: 58.49
<S> the thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her thoughts .: 89.27
<S> planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures ; he was a man of uncommonly sound sense .: 110.57
<S> i say nothing about blaisois , for he is only fit to hold the horses .: 40.23
<S> yes , said porthos , recollecting himself , but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for two . well ; but there s his comrade . true , said porthos .: 35.10
<S> mordaunt reappeared .: 47.17
<S> i hear , she said , that paris is not quiet .: 30.05
<S> athos always carried the key of this coffer about him ; but he one day opened it before porthos , and porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing but letters and papers love letters and family papers , no doubt .: 84.01
<S> d artagnan sprang back ; the wall had closed again .: 27.06
<S> d artagnan looked at porthos .: 10.77
<S> there is our wine in bottles , and our wine in casks ; the beer , the oil , and the spices , the bacon , and sausages .: 51.21
<S> how could i pronounce that word ?: 32.50
<S> he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis , made in a quarter of an hour , when a voice was heard at the door of the hall , which made him stir .: 30.23
<S> villefort .: 42.76
<S> dear friend to an englishman , interrupted athos ; well commenced !: 102.15
<S> touches upon the strange effects a half pistole may have .: 245.84
<S> divan , walls , ceiling , floor , were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets ; there were heavy maned lion skins from atlas , striped tiger skins from bengal ; panther skins from the cape , spotted beautifully , like those that appeared to dante ; bear skins from siberia , fox skins from norway , and so on ; and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other , so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf , or reclining on the most luxurious bed .: 82.29
<S> patrick , who knew lord de winter was in affairs of the service , and in relations of friendship with the duke , gave the preference to the one who came in his name .: 37.37
<S> there was no time to lose .: 9.66
<S> albert , she asked , did you notice that ? what , mother ? that the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of m. de morcerf . yes ; but then he breakfasted with me indeed , he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion . but your house is not m. de morcerf s , murmured merce de s ; and since he has been here i have watched him . well ? well , he has taken nothing yet . the count is very temperate . merce de s smiled sadly .: 36.87
<S> unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg : 1.e.1 .: 28.93
<S> grimaud and his basket were far in advance , out of the range of the balls .: 45.12
<S> dead on the scaffold ; condemned by parliament . impossible ! and executed in our presence . what , then , has monsieur de flamarens been telling me ? monsieur de flamarens ? yes , he has just gone out . athos smiled .: 49.87
<S> wait quietly , then ; in two hours , in four , in six hours at latest , planchet will be here .: 51.97
<S> as for you , you have acted like a barmaid .: 26.85
<S> valentine kissed the old man , who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled with tears , whose sources he thought must be exhausted .: 38.77
<S> but what makes you doubt it ? i was afraid i had made a mistake in the chamber , and that i had found my way into the apartment of some churchman .: 29.07
<S> then , my son , return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows ; and if i am wrong , still let me cherish these hopes , for i have no future to look forward to .: 61.94
<S> the conference being finished , the queen summoned him to her cabinet .: 40.31
<S> you still confide , then , in sinbad the sailor ? asked he , smiling .: 37.21
<S> who , then , has so correctly informed you ? asked he ; for my paper , which gave the first information on the subject , has been obliged to stop for want of proof ; and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m. de morcerf , as he is a peer of france , and we are of the opposition . oh , that is very simple ; we have not sought to scandalize .: 39.65
<S> but the wind was contrary , the sea bad ; they tacked and kept offshore .: 151.50
<S> mousqueton sighed again , more deeply than before .: 82.60
<S> oh , father , father ! murmured she , courage ! the pharaon has gone down , then ? said morrel in a hoarse voice .: 19.11
<S> pooh ! said the duke , too much astonished to believe it true .: 26.88
<S> i breathe more freely . in fact , porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful lungs .: 53.02
<S> gentlemen !: 25.46
<S> by heaven ! at last said athos , the first to speak , by this time , i think , all must be over . here , my lords !: 38.35
<S> then he explained to him the cause of his visit , and the service he required of him .: 26.11
<S> perhaps it was a mere whim on his part , for he is falling , they say , into second childhood , but i love him for showing so much interest in you . how singular , murmured maximilian ; your father hates me , while your grandfather , on the contrary what strange feelings are aroused by politics . hush , cried valentine , suddenly ; someone is coming ! maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern , which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way , under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it .: 67.56
<S> bonacieux , he could obtain no intelligence of her .: 39.94
<S> m. noirtier , although almost as immovable as a corpse , looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent expression , perceiving at once , by their ceremonious courtesy , that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character .: 47.13
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> why didst thou take it ? yes why ? asked la ramee .: 36.75
<S> the young man looked , bowed in obedience , and then went to teresa , and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the count s daughter .: 31.64
<S> she was fearful of exciting any remark , and believed firmly in her daughter s innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof .: 71.73
<S> bonacieux , we must have them back again . yes , without doubt , it is necessary , cried the queen ; but how am i to act ?: 22.26
<S> d artagnan held the bridle of athos s horse and porthos that of aramis .: 27.35
<S> is it not by chance that the unfortunate child was disinterred under the trees ? that poor innocent offspring of mine , which i never even kissed , but for whom i wept many , many tears .: 73.15
<S> still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain .: 114.33
<S> sir , replied olivain , respectfully , allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning .: 38.38
<S> you will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow creature , or will administer to him , in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation , that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked .: 60.80
<S> cavalcanti , dressed in black , like one of goethe s heroes , with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings , passed a white and tolerably nice looking hand through his light hair , and so displayed a sparkling diamond , that in spite of monte cristo s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger .: 72.74
<S> a propos , inform bazin . will bazin go with us ? asked aramis .: 37.26
<S> he will come in here , and m. morrel had better go , do you not think so , grandpapa ? yes , signed the old man .: 29.06
<S> 6 guillotine .: 239.36
<S> he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud .: 30.84
<S> what she ? asked athos .: 14.72
<S> have i any need to tell you so ?: 23.65
<S> d artagnan unfolded it with one hand , whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal , to read : dec .: 40.20
<S> half past twelve , he said .: 15.41
<S> at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest .: 11.87
<S> ah ! cried porthos ; would i were but a baron ! well , my friend , i am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much . porthos gave a start that shook the room ; two or three bottles fell and were broken .: 37.13
<S> meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton , though he did not himself wait on the table , which would have been beneath him in his new position , appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to d artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served .: 44.93
<S> we may like bouillotte , delight in whist , be enraptured with boston , and yet grow tired of them all ; but we always come back to e carte it is not only a game , it is a hors d uvre !: 141.24
<S> the watch might come up and take all the combatants , wounded or not , royalists or cardinalists .: 116.28
<S> i assure you , franz and i were lost in admiration . nothing more simple , returned the count .: 34.50
<S> we immediately drew , and at the first pass i laid him stark dead . the devil ! cried d artagnan .: 51.80
<S> well , i too could keep a servant ; i too could have a tilbury ; i too could dine where i like ; but why do i not ?: 74.07
<S> i have my sword . and no one waiting for you outside ? no . then you had better come with me . thank you , sir , but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and i have none to lose . cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it .: 55.55
<S> one morning the gardener went to him and told him , as if to please him , that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use .: 44.03
<S> he shall not come in before i am gone , said he ; and when i am gone , you can open to him . but i ought to be gone , too .: 36.14
<S> ah , yes , said porthos , there is nine o clock .: 10.49
<S> the tumult now began to increase ; the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction ; the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage .: 80.64
<S> who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection ? that is possible , said the countess , reflecting .: 99.30
<S> at seven o clock in the evening all was ready , and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled .: 35.91
<S> if god were just , you know how many would be punished who now escape . patience , said the abbe , in a tone which made the dying man shudder ; have patience ! caderousse looked at him with amazement .: 41.19
<S> i regret i did not inform you sooner of this circumstance . you have truly , monsieur , said d artagnan , bowing again , a courtesy , for which , i assure you , i am very grateful . you confuse me , replied athos , with his gentlemanly air ; let us talk of something else , if you please .: 24.04
<S> you have been here a very long time , john , said he .: 20.39
<S> they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master ; and although these squibs may be , for the most part , traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets , they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii. , anne of austria , richelieu , mazarin , and the courtiers of the period , less faithful than in the history of m. anquetil .: 67.02
<S> many a time , nevertheless , during the evening she despaired of fate and of herself .: 85.38
<S> certainly , i might have lived happily amongst those good people , who adored me , but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart .: 80.49
<S> but at pont neuf he found louvieres and his bourgeois .: 93.71
<S> all the way , and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted , d artagnan wished to stop the young woman , seize her and gaze upon her , were it only for a minute ; but quick as a bird she glided between his hands , and when he wished to speak to her , her finger placed upon her mouth , with a little imperative gesture full of grace , reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey , and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint .: 49.28
<S> i could have drunk fifty bottles more . d artagnan could no longer endure this conversation , which had made him bewildered .: 52.20
<S> yes , yes , said la ramee , the matter concerns you , for you will have the honor to serve us ; and besides , however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst , there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles , and that something will be yours . grimaud bowed in thanks .: 54.07
<S> so , at least , the duke believed ; but sleep is a capricious fairy , and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting .: 67.56
<S> anne frowned .: 55.42
<S> you must dress him up during my absence .: 64.22
<S> the crisis was terrible , and a rigid form with twisted limbs , swollen eyelids , and lips flecked with bloody foam , lay on the bed of torture , in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there .: 84.75
<S> dante s was tossed about on these doubts and wishes , when the patron , who had great confidence in him , and was very desirous of retaining him in his service , took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the via del oglio , where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade .: 69.23
<S> he began by asking m. bonacieux his name , age , condition , and abode .: 128.00
<S> but , continued the porter , he would not take them . andrea turned pale , but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible .: 30.34
<S> i do not love her , but i will avenge myself for her contempt . oh , yes , i know what sort of vengeance !: 17.09
<S> this evening the margin of possible delay expires . what do you think should be done , asked athos , if we have no news of them to night ? pardieu !: 42.13
<S> the young woman in the street replied by a single tap , and the shutter was opened a little way .: 43.79
<S> and here he comes , by jupiter !: 56.79
<S> gentlemen , resumed aramis , any one but the comte de la fere and myself would have had you arrested for we have friends in paris but we are contented with another course .: 41.92
<S> the count , dismissing his carriage , followed him about a hundred paces behind .: 29.30
<S> perhaps mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer , as we did in straw , said porthos .: 67.83
<S> i have , then , to inform you , sir , at the request of m. de villefort , that your projected marriage with mademoiselle de villefort has changed the feeling of m. noirtier towards his grandchild , and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her .: 24.81
<S> the four friends followed him .: 10.64
<S> quite certain ? said milady , with a last doubt .: 44.74
<S> friend , said he , for athos this is too much ; for the comte de la fe re it is too little .: 24.76
<S> the king , half dressed , the queen and laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place , where they were listening and waiting .: 47.26
<S> i once possessed four dear and faithful friends , besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed he said ; and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss .: 81.08
<S> the general depended much on it ; he even came to force m. danglars .: 79.72
<S> he was , as this remark shows , a man full of philanthropy , and in every way fit for his office .: 60.96
<S> but after all , resumed the abbess , monsieur cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus ; and though she has the look of an angel , we must not always judge people by the appearance . good ! said milady to herself ; who knows !: 85.09
<S> i say we have been here eighty three hours . tis your fault , answered porthos .: 36.75
<S> orders were given that no drum should be beaten , no trumpet sounded .: 144.15
<S> do you know him , aramis ? as well as you do , gentlemen ; for i was among those who seized him in the garden at amiens , into which monsieur putange , the queen s equerry , introduced me .: 31.43
<S> from two o clock till five franz and albert followed in the fe te , exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians , who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident , a single dispute , or a single fight .: 84.81
<S> the first idea that occurred to milady s mind was that she had been betrayed by kitty , and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant .: 54.20
<S> aha ! he cried with a smile of satisfaction .: 11.99
<S> never , sir , replied the jailer , never ; on the contrary , he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories .: 37.98
<S> well , you stand well with m. morrel i hear , you insinuating dog , you ! m .: 96.04
<S> monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow , which no one else observed .: 27.66
<S> aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal , kissed the superscription with an almost religious respect , and opened the epistle , which contained what follows : my friend , it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time separated ; but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond return .: 44.70
<S> that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated .: 111.62
<S> the citizens always took up arms readily against thieves , wolves or scoundrels , often against nobles or huguenots , sometimes against the king , but never against the cardinal or spain .: 151.64
<S> he stifled , therefore , the feelings of compassion that were rising , composed his features , and sat down , grim and sombre , at his desk .: 65.88
<S> order of the king , i tell you .: 36.11

<S> he looked coldly at the queen , who nudged mazarin to make him say something in his turn .: 38.13
<S> life is full of humiliations and sorrows , continued he , becoming still more melancholy ; all the ties which attach him to life break in the hand of man , particularly the golden ties .: 80.90
<S> but methinks i need wine ! and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left , put it to his mouth , and emptied it at a single draught , as he would have emptied an ordinary glass .: 53.37
<S> and monsieur de nogaret de la valette , what do you say of him ?: 35.70
<S> go away as quick as you can , maximilian , said valentine , and stay till i send for you .: 29.15
<S> pardon , pardon , my officer , and i will tell you all . is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it ? asked the young man , withholding his arm .: 30.59
<S> oh ! muttered mazarin , i do believe he is going off with the diamond !: 27.90
<S> has not some sage said , nothing too much ?: 122.35
<S> you are right , cried the affrighted mme .: 31.48
<S> the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile , and retiring from the window , came out of the hostelry with a slow step , and placed himself before the horse , within two paces of d artagnan .: 24.18
<S> at every noise he heard , the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of milady coming to throw herself into his arms , to accuse herself , and die with him .: 64.01
<S> the authorities had terrified me , and you know that an innkeeper must keep on good terms with the authorities . but once again , that gentleman where is he ?: 73.42
<S> as soon as she saw him she seized his hand ; her own hands were moist and icy cold .: 35.28
<S> thanks to the influence of m. morrel , to whom , next to my father , i owe every blessing i enjoy , every difficulty has been removed .: 56.80
<S> follow us at a distance of twenty paces , as far as the louvre , and if anyone watches us , slay him ! d artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm , allowed the duke and mme .: 42.33
<S> at length he advanced toward the group , the meaning of which he could not comprehend .: 20.82
<S> yes , kill them ! cried d artagnan ; i see fresh tracks ; tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place . in fact , the road was trodden by horses feet , visible even in the approaching gloom of evening .: 49.59
<S> why , my companion .: 32.73
<S> well , my poor friend , replied beauchamp , i expected you . i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance .: 30.57
<S> the footsteps they were double paused at the door and dante s guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek him this idea was soon converted into certainty , when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand bier .: 72.27
<S> stop , i want to remember his exact words .: 71.95
<S> sir , said the notary , how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case mademoiselle de villefort still determines on marrying m. franz ? the old man gave no answer .: 38.66
<S> when ali was wanted one stroke was given , two summoned baptistin , and three bertuccio .: 246.00
<S> i am called , said andrea .: 13.18
<S> you can come and dine three times a week , said mme .: 33.31
<S> ah , ah ! said he , what does this mean ? this is the gentleman i am going to fight with , said athos , pointing to d artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture .: 13.84
<S> well , my lord , said la ramee , with his rude laugh , you still set yourself against this poor fellow ? so !: 26.77
<S> i would rather have had a hat , said d artagnan .: 15.20
<S> he came there , and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba , the projected landing , etc .: 79.28
<S> in one of these risings , the duc de beaufort pillaged the house and library of mazarin , in order to give the populace , as he put it , something to gnaw at .: 45.11
<S> dante s , as we have said , had traced the marks along the rocks , and he had noticed that they led to a small creek , which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph .: 32.16
<S> now , i tell you , you must pass with me through this army across to scotland , and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names , which the contempt of all honest men will brand you with you are either cowards or traitors ! the eyes of the scotch flashed fire ; and , as often happens on such occasions , from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king .: 94.66
<S> it is a long time since we have had a battle , eh , porthos ? battle ! cried porthos .: 18.70
<S> consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking , for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise ; and now , at the moment when i reckoned upon success , my hopes are forever dashed from me .: 76.32
<S> my dear count , allow me to show you the way . they passed silently into the breakfast room , and everyone took his place .: 24.19
<S> oh , be assured , if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me , you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at tyburn .: 61.76
<S> be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability , and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing .: 111.75
<S> one may well perceive , young man , that you are inexperienced .: 60.49
<S> m. de tre ville required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice , and each time his companions saw his brow become darker .: 51.06
<S> well , you gave him the two hundred francs i had left for him ? yes , your excellency . andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed .: 31.56
<S> i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up the hole ; while doing so i had leaned against a laburnum ; behind me was an artificial rockery , intended to serve as a resting place for persons walking in the garden ; in falling , my hand , relaxing its hold of the laburnum , felt the coldness of the stone .: 91.35
<S> be tranquil , and go wait for me in my chamber . but , my lord go , sir , i command you ! at this injunction from his superior , felton obeyed ; but in going out , he put the knife into his bosom .: 42.51
<S> the natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains , between civilized and savage life .: 73.73
<S> take a cigar . really , my dear albert , replied lucien , lighting a manilla at a rose colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand how happy you are to have nothing to do .: 76.49

<S> scattering money round about him as heaven sprinkles rain .: 658.52
<S> it might be called a magnificent prison .: 41.28
<S> therefore d artagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m. de tre ville , confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure , when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers , and that they formed part of the escort .: 23.71
<S> porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women .: 56.33

<S> charles stuart had asked that bishop juxon might be permitted to visit him .: 92.74
<S> he will treat me better the next time i see him . you have the means , then , of touching him ? i have the means of making myself feared . mazarin looked at the young man , but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head ; then , embarrassed how to continue such a conversation , he opened cromwell s letter .: 39.33
<S> fernand departed with the rest , bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away , his rival would perhaps return and marry merce de s .: 93.63
<S> such felicity seems above all price as a thing impossible and unattainable .: 292.32
<S> at any rate , murmured he , if it be , so much the better , for i have made a rare acquisition . 0279m under pretence of being fatigued , dante s asked to take the helm ; the steersman , glad to be relieved , looked at the captain , and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade .: 43.35
<S> come , forget him for a moment , and instead of pursuing him , let him go . you are too late , madame ; the orders are issued . well , should he be arrested do they think they will arrest him ? i hope so . if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape , will you leave him in prison ? the procureur shook his head .: 43.24
<S> the young man , having dismissed the boy and horse , knocked at the door of the hotel , which was opened , and again closed after his entrance .: 32.50
<S> one of the culprits will be mazzolato ; 3 he is an atrocious villain , who murdered the priest who brought him up , and deserves not the smallest pity .: 61.27

<S> captain , said felton , this is the person of whom i spoke to you , and whom you must convey safe and sound to france . for a thousand pistoles , said the captain .: 29.97
<S> then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive .: 340.66
<S> this war may not only bring great catastrophes upon england and france , but misfortune upon you , my lord , for which i should never console myself .: 55.81
<S> see if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair , who was with me just now , is still in the palace . bernouin went out and soon returned with comminges , who was on guard .: 52.63
<S> sire , said d artagnan , will your majesty permit me to ask you a question ? louis xiv .: 13.02

<S> when mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all , friends and foes ; and on my word he would be bad company in going either to heaven or to hell . you have some plan , then ? asked athos .: 71.93
<S> the woman who was outside the window turned round , and passed within four steps of d artagnan , pulling down the hood of her mantle ; but the precaution was too late , d artagnan had already recognized mme .: 39.35
<S> he took her for the queen ! said d artagnan .: 17.61
<S> athos and d artagnan , with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs , hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the musketeer .: 53.35
<S> he never spoke to him , except under the most extraordinary occasions .: 44.55
<S> you said anne de bueil , did you not ? yes , yes , that was her name ; and now absolve me , for i am dying . i , absolve you ! cried the priest , with a laugh which made the dying man s hair stand on end ; i , absolve you ?: 27.22
<S> they promised , upon separating , to meet at the duke of bracciano s ball , to which all rome was invited .: 46.46
<S> let us strive , i beseech you , let us strive to be cheerful . yes , let us strive , for you ought to live , and to be happy , albert . and so our division is made , mother , said the young man , affecting ease of mind .: 26.48
<S> you understand , then , that if it were so , said he , rising in his turn , and approaching the baroness , to speak to her in a lower tone , we are lost .: 18.59
<S> de bernet were exiled , and laporte did not conceal from his mistress that he expected to be arrested every instant .: 62.77
<S> they had traveled onward about half a mile when planchet came close up to d artagnan .: 65.28
<S> at that moment a man appeared in the doorway , almost as pale as those in the chamber .: 15.35
<S> i hoped to be able to rely upon that . and i , madame ! said d artagnan , embarrassed ; you promised me take my arm , madame , said the stranger , and let us continue our way . d artagnan , however , stupefied , cast down , annihilated by all that happened , stood , with crossed arms , before the musketeer and mme .: 29.66
<S> hasten to monte cristo avail yourself of the fortune for you have indeed suffered long enough . a violent convulsion attacked the old man .: 112.93
<S> you do not know these ultramontane millionaires ; they are regular misers .: 56.97
<S> we have parted company this long time ; all three have left the service . where can you find them , then ? wherever they are , that s my business . well , now , what are your conditions , if i employ you ? money , my lord , as much money as what you wish me to undertake will require .: 49.42
<S> have you any money ? d artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket .: 20.80
<S> when m. andrea cavalcanti has become one of the family , you can ask him that question . the carriage stopped .: 39.25
<S> one would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin .: 28.50
<S> the count s tutor , a man of the world and a bon vivant , up to his eyes in learning , as his pupil described him , often recalled the profound erudition , the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul ; but as regarded grace , delicacy , and nobility of external appearance , no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere .: 60.07
<S> you agree that you have no remedies for negligence , strict liability , breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1.f.3 .: 32.30
<S> then you have thought that barrois was poisoned ? yes . do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him ? no . do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked valentine ? yes . then will she die too ? asked d avrigny , fixing his penetrating gaze on noirtier .: 50.43
<S> charles , leaning on a table , was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter ; he was waiting first for juxon , then for martyrdom .: 53.01

<S> the fresh earth excavated during their present work , and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage , was thrown , by degrees and with the utmost precaution , out of the window in either faria s or dante s cell , the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain .: 143.04
<S> he went and resumed his post , beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude .: 40.36
<S> where are you ? murmured coquenard , and he tried to smile .: 22.20
<S> what i think of is , that we have crossed swords as enemies .: 64.05
<S> i don t know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was rather rather strong in greek . he spoke the romaic language , did he ? i think so . that settles it , murmured franz .: 47.35
<S> as to lord de winter , he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady , and when she was come , he recommended the prisoner , who was still fainting , to her care , and left them alone .: 28.27
<S> besides , we must try our own arms . bah , let us enjoy that pleasure , said aramis , with his mild and careless manner .: 28.74
<S> they want food already .: 256.87
<S> come , sit down , and tell us all about this signor vampa . i had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of mastrilla . well , what has this bandit to do with the order i have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo , and to re enter by the porta san giovanni ? 20101m this , replied signor pastrini , that you will go out by one , but i very much doubt your returning by the other . why ? asked franz .: 33.02
<S> friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear .: 61.91
<S> you can understand that one of two things must have happened ; he must either have fallen flat , in which case the blow , from a height of ninety feet , must have killed him instantly , or he must have fallen upright , and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom , where he remained poor fellow ! then you pity him ? said the count .: 44.87
<S> it must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor , in which d artagnan lodged , those who called on him were exempted from this detention .: 80.73
<S> two hours passed away .: 13.71
<S> besides , let me own something to you .: 36.93
<S> yes , i have said it and i now repeat it : our destinies are irrevocably united , although we now pursue divergent roads .: 84.55
<S> no , he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket , and took from it a paper folded in four , and after having examined it in a manner almost reverential , he said : good !: 40.98
<S> this man was armand jean duplessis , cardinal de richelieu ; not such as he is now represented broken down like an old man , suffering like a martyr , his body bent , his voice failing , buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb ; no longer living but by the strength of his genius , and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughts but such as he really was at this period ; that is to say , an active and gallant cavalier , already weak of body , but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived , preparing , after having supported the duc de nevers in his duchy of mantua , after having taken ni mes , castres , and uzes , to drive the english from the isle of re and lay siege to la rochelle .: 74.17
<S> ah , it is you , peppino , said the count .: 10.05
<S> amidst all these alternations of hope and fear , the clock struck ten .: 100.67
<S> well , i take you with me ; we conceal ourselves , and wait together . but i shall not be allowed to go ; i am almost a prisoner . as they believe that i go in consequence of an order from the cardinal , no one will believe you anxious to follow me . well ? well !: 42.13
<S> i see you are spoiled , dear friend ; you are corpulent , your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinal s guards have so many proofs . ah !: 55.78
<S> with the entrance of m. morrel , danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation , and to beseech him to make haste .: 50.49
<S> they then embraced each other like two brothers , and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds , flowers and infants .: 98.40
<S> he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere , and then went on .: 74.85
<S> the general was pacing the room the third time when , in turning , he perceived monte cristo at the door .: 35.89
<S> i have augmented our fortune , and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years , till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it , without any fault of mine , i can honestly declare .: 73.82
<S> the fire crackled , and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano ; but still no prisoner fell down , as they expected .: 86.64
<S> the procureur exerted himself to reply .: 26.88
<S> he waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior , for fear he might be mistaken ; but this gesture being repeated , he left the ranks , and advanced to receive orders .: 29.57
<S> dante s first impulse was to escape , but fortunately he did not attempt it .: 15.99

<S> they heard the guard going its rounds .: 119.74
<S> i comprehend now . you comprehend ? said porthos .: 30.05
<S> bertuccio sat down upon the chair , andrea threw himself upon the bed ; the keeper retired .: 41.70
<S> come , come with me , gentlemen ! exclaimed mazarin .: 11.25
<S> on the morrow he received the last touches of mousqueton s brush for an hour , and took his way toward the rue aux ours with the steps of a man who was doubly in favor with fortune .: 38.84
<S> as soon as he arrives inform me .: 36.27
<S> my lords , answered he , it is not by time i could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me , and , doubtless , hidden in obscurity ; it is immediately , and by a thunderbolt , that i must repel the flash of lightning which , for a moment , startled me .: 54.22
<S> d artagnan , on his side , went up to the landlady , praised her wine which was a horrible production from the country of montreuil and heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village ; one of these belonged to the archbishop of paris , and was at that time the abode of his niece the duchess of longueville ; the other was a convent of jesuits and was the property a by no means unusual circumstance of these worthy fathers .: 64.72
<S> villefort again groaned with anguish and despair .: 55.63
<S> the rest concerns myself ; don t be uneasy about that . be prudent , athos , said aramis .: 45.49
<S> i promised to come , said felton , and i have come . you promised me something else . what , my god ! said the young man , who in spite of his self command felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow .: 28.01
<S> i am as certain of it as that we two are christians . the abbe , with a shaking hand , seized a glass of water that was standing by him half full , swallowed it at one gulp , and then resumed his seat , with red eyes and pale cheeks .: 49.76
<S> i stumbled over some object ; i stooped to examine it was the second pistol , which had not gone off , probably from the powder being wet .: 84.45
<S> thomson french ? inquired the stranger .: 55.21
<S> as the town clock of newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke , and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him ; perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel .: 81.31
<S> felton and he addressed patrick , the duke s confidential lackey , at the same moment .: 46.66
<S> to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their servants .: 129.80
<S> while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open , turned , and saw his father .: 34.01
<S> at the names comte de la fere and chevalier d herblay , charles opened his eyes , and raising his noble head , in spite of himself , threw a glance at all the actors in the scene .: 25.27
<S> between the court and the garden , built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture , was the large and fashionable dwelling of the count and countess of morcerf .: 37.73
<S> and then there are robbers , said la carconte .: 19.05
<S> yes , yes , the mortuary deposition .: 47.24
<S> monsieur de beaufort or monsieur le prince . but monsieur le prince is to set out for the army ; he is entirely devoted to the cardinal . oh oh ! said aramis , there are questions between them at this very moment .: 26.63
<S> i showed you this morning that i had a heart , did i not , count ? monte cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man .: 24.02
<S> he had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference ; he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover patch , prepared to hear the result of the proceedings , and very certain that valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty .: 42.86
<S> mademoiselle , said franz , turning towards valentine , unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age . valentine remained dumb and motionless .: 29.60
<S> he was rather too pale , certainly ; but then , you know , paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding . franz smiled ; for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion .: 117.46
<S> d artagnan frowned at him .: 16.97
<S> really , sir , d artagnan said to him , i am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue .: 34.94
<S> monte cristo went to the window , and saw them crossing the street , arm in arm .: 24.82
<S> there was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage .: 42.64
<S> my drunkenness is always sad , and when i am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain .: 106.74
<S> he pushed through the crowd , approached athos , still insensible , and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him greatly , he required , as the first and most urgent thing , that the musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber .: 61.63
<S> the count did not notice the introduction , in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house ; but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand , he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him .: 66.94
<S> he cast a rapid glance around the room , and perceived that one of his men was missing .: 18.14
<S> i shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question me .: 33.05
<S> but what brings you here ? his eminence was uneasy , and sent me to find you . i only arrived yesterday . and what have you been doing since yesterday ? i have not lost my time . oh , i don t doubt that . do you know whom i have encountered here ? no . guess . how can i ? that young woman whom the queen took out of prison . the mistress of that fellow d artagnan ? yes ; madame bonacieux , with whose retreat the cardinal was unacquainted . well , well , said rochefort , here is a chance which may pair off with the other !: 37.58
<S> bazin , who had been standing listening to all this controversy with a pious jubilation , sprang toward them , took the breviary of the curate and the missal of the jesuit , and walked respectfully before them to clear their way .: 51.14
<S> surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other person . yes ; but in our situation we must not say all we know particularly as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues . well , can i see porthos ? certainly , monsieur .: 50.71
<S> it was worth while , truly , added the young man with a melancholy smile , to make war against the english for ten years , and to die in his bed at last , like everybody else . why , you see , edmond , replied the owner , who appeared more comforted at every moment , we are all mortal , and the old must make way for the young .: 44.69
<S> if a man had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father , your mother , your betrothed , a being who , when torn from you , left a desolation , a wound that never closes , in your breast , do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer , and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain ? yes , i know , said franz , that human justice is insufficient to console us ; she can give blood in return for blood , that is all ; but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant . i will put another case to you , continued the count ; that where society , attacked by the death of a person , avenges death by death .: 92.86
<S> you are ill shall i ring for assistance ? shall i call ? no , said villefort , rising hastily ; stay where you are .: 60.54
<S> listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure , the fine , noble face of athos betrayed indescribable pleasure ; he inhaled the tones of that young voice , as harmonious music .: 97.46
<S> help me , gentlemen , cried d artagnan , we must break in this door . it is the devil in person ! said aramis , hastening forward .: 30.04
<S> the same evening all villefort s servants , who had assembled in the kitchen , and had a long consultation , came to tell madame de villefort that they wished to leave .: 39.28
<S> one ! said the count mysteriously , his eyes fixed on the corpse , disfigured by so awful a death .: 44.47
<S> young men , take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command . but on condition , continued the prisoner , that your highness will swear that my life shall be safe . upon my honor , said the prince .: 33.19
<S> you have a park , and horses , servants . athos smiled .: 28.66
<S> it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence , that you would desire to live no longer , but to dream thus forever .: 99.78
<S> he had gone down about three quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke .: 38.66
<S> speak on . they denounced edmond as a bonapartist agent . which of the two denounced him ?: 101.61
<S> you excel us all . athos smiled with ineffable pleasure .: 58.73
<S> the three presents of d artagnan the elder on the first monday of the month of april , 1625 , the market town of meung , in which the author of romance of the rose was born , appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the huguenots had just made a second la rochelle of it .: 41.34
<S> come , let us come to the point .: 12.12
<S> everything is paid , replied the host , and liberally .: 33.65
<S> has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command ?: 46.39
<S> eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat , where directly athos was warmed and reanimated , reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends , who were intoxicated with joy .: 62.92
<S> or to speak in plain terms , do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything ? villefort s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary .: 143.40
<S> we shall see , said athos , for we shall go to the sittings , i presume . you will not have long to wait , said the landlord ; they begin to morrow . so , then , they drew up the indictments before the king was taken ? of course , said d artagnan ; they began the day he was sold . and you know , said aramis , that it was our friend mordaunt who made , if not the bargain , at least the overtures . and you know , added d artagnan , that whenever i catch him i will kill him , this mordaunt . and i , too , exclaimed porthos .: 37.21
<S> yes , continued mme .: 9.56
<S> you have assassinated a woman , then ? cried the monk .: 25.32
<S> ten kicks on his back ! said d artagnan ; be off , you little villain , and forget not that i have your address . friquet , who did not expect to be let off so cheaply , bounded off like a gazelle up the quai a la rue dauphine , and disappeared .: 74.97
<S> you may go and offer your adieux and mine to madame de saint remy .: 28.15
<S> what news ? exclaimed a general burst of voices .: 69.40
<S> a poet is as good as an abbe .: 33.32
<S> we will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post .: 43.62
<S> if the reality corresponds with appearances i am lost ; for a man so well off will never change his happy condition , and i shall fail with him , as i have already done with aramis . chapter xi .: 79.24
<S> and yet , since the amusement seemed to me rather tame , i proposed to chevalier de rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors , and , in order to see to advantage , that we should mount the bronze horse .: 71.33
<S> at the moment he opened the door , the three musketeers and d artagnan , conducted by la chesnaye , appeared at the top of the staircase .: 14.32
<S> then the inconvenience became distress .: 165.52
<S> i have perhaps offended you in your creed ; but it was without wishing to do so , i swear .: 31.03
<S> she had succeeded ; d artagnan was then in her power !: 52.76
<S> in the midst of his amorous projects for the mercer s wife , he did not forget his friends .: 28.12
<S> athos , who was very expert in all bodily exercises , passed with d artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them ; but at the first effort he made , although he played with his left hand , he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion .: 53.03
<S> this gentleman was a young man , scarcely sixteen years of age , now white with anger .: 24.94
<S> one of his guns was swung over his shoulder , gaetano had the other , and a sailor held his rifle ; his dress , half artist , half dandy , did not excite any suspicion , and , consequently , no disquietude .: 60.91
<S> nachrichter , as say our neighbors , the germans . and as he bound her while saying these words , milady uttered two or three savage cries , which produced a strange and melancholy effect in flying away into the night , and losing themselves in the depths of the woods .: 72.09
<S> i can not thus , in a moment relinquish the respect , the confidence , and pride with which a father s untarnished name inspires a son .: 72.97
<S> he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast , explained to him the variations of the compass , and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven , and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds .: 57.62
<S> albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man .: 83.44
<S> i shall hear from you ? yes . thanks , thanks , dear love , adieu ! the sound of a kiss was heard , and valentine fled through the avenue .: 38.75
<S> they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants . but how is it that you know so much of these matters ? i know them because the men of whom i speak were at that time my enemies ; because they fought against me ; because i did them all the harm i could and they returned it to the best of their ability ; because one of them , with whom i had most to do , gave me a pretty sword thrust , now about seven years ago , the third that i received from the same hand ; it closed an old account . ah ! said mazarin , with admirable suavity , could i but find such men ! my lord , there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as i describe , and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you . who is it ? it is monsieur d artagnan . that gascon ! cried mazarin , with well acted surprise .: 57.12
<S> monsieur d artagnan , said the cardinal , sitting down on a fauteuil , you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man . possibly , thought d artagnan , but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts ; nevertheless , he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for mazarin s compliment .: 28.34
<S> and now , at last said the queen , now that we are alone , repeat your counsel , monsieur le coadjuteur . it is this , madame : that you should appear to have reflected , and publicly acknowledge an error , which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government ; release broussel from prison and give him back to the people . oh ! cried anne , to humble myself thus !: 69.94
<S> if it was mme .: 27.39
<S> come , take a little oath for me on the cross ; i won t ask anything more of you . on the cross , cried i , rising , for at that abhorred voice i had recovered all my strength , on the cross i swear that no promise , no menace , no force , no torture , shall close my mouth !: 72.80
<S> the husband had presided at the abduction of his wife .: 29.87
<S> d artagnan then thought of that cottage , silent and obscure , which had no doubt seen all , and could tell its tale .: 56.18
<S> the litter , borne by two servants , now entered the house .: 39.41
<S> ah , ha , cried danglars , this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else ; however , i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating ! we see that danglars was collected enough to jest ; at the same time , as though to disprove the ogreish propensities , the man took some black bread , cheese , and onions from his wallet , which he began devouring voraciously .: 71.07
<S> the count said a word in arabic to ali , and the horses went on at great speed .: 49.68
<S> be it then as you desire .: 52.41
<S> aramis , blushing in spite of himself , took the letter , which was in a large , coarse hand and not particular for its orthography .: 45.22
<S> i repeat to you , i don t know her . why , she is the old wife of a procurator of the cha telet , monsieur , named madame coquenard , who , although she is at least fifty , still gives herself jealous airs .: 38.18
<S> this is the way in which you northerns understand chemistry , madame .: 36.47
<S> she lived in the place royale then the fashionable quarter at number 6 , and he undertook to call and take d artagnan with him in order to introduce him .: 62.66
<S> and now , once more , adieu , said morrel .: 29.28
<S> in the evening , about nine o clock , at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed , he heard steps in his corridor .: 15.28
<S> brave as you are and strong as you are , you could not kill them all . tis true , answered porthos , rising on his saddle , in order that he might appraise the immense crowd , there are a lot of them . i think i should like the other fellow better than this one , said mazarin to himself , and he threw himself back in his carriage .: 31.75
<S> there ; do you see , madame , he recognizes you , and bows . the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner .: 34.22
<S> raoul , i seem to read your future destiny as through a cloud .: 103.72
<S> bonacieux was known to belong to the queen ; the duke wore the uniform of the musketeers of m. de tre ville , who , as we have said , were that evening on guard .: 23.45
<S> if beauchamp be disposed to retract , you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will , the satisfaction to you will be the same .: 58.99
<S> toward four o clock in the morning the doctor arrived ; but since the time milady stabbed herself , however short , the wound had closed .: 48.10
<S> no , madame ; but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you ? 20269m yes , i do remember , replied the countess .: 21.88
<S> if you are not located in the united states , you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this ebook .: 10.33
<S> now , say if i conceal anything from you ? no , and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion ; and your princely father , is he rich , very rich ? yes , he is that ; he does not himself know the amount of his fortune . is it possible ? it is evident enough to me , who am always at his house .: 36.64
<S> thanks , said the poor abbe , shivering as though his veins were filled with ice .: 34.13
<S> d artagnan made kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following morning .: 29.40
<S> here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third compartment .: 101.68
<S> i will restore you to liberty this moment ; i will proclaim you a piece of immaculate virtue ; i will name you the lucretia of england . and i will say that you are the sextus .: 38.28
<S> a few moments after , the little door was opened and a man entered .: 25.82
<S> whilst supper is being prepared , he said , smiling , you will not , my friend , be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up . true , monsieur le comte , replied d artagnan , who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him .: 45.21
<S> athos , wounded anew by cahusac , became evidently paler , but did not give way a foot .: 74.89
<S> silence ! said d artagnan , pressing her hand more closely .: 16.55
<S> fool that i was !: 119.74
<S> grimaud extended his arm , and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river , within a hundred paces of a ferry .: 43.53
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous , and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness .: 44.94
<S> do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me ? yes , monsieur , said the englishman , bowing .: 25.15
<S> the corvette must now , i think , be on her way to fe camp , must she not ? 20333m certainly , your excellency ; i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles . and the yacht . was ordered to remain at martigues . tis well .: 109.83
<S> nogent beautin , the fool of the court , exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment . this caused a universal burst of laughter .: 65.01
<S> dante s stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle , as if he now beheld it for the first time ; and indeed since his captivity in the cha teau d if he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed .: 36.44
<S> die , impenitent , die in despair , die and be damned ! and drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man , saying , here is my absolution ! then was heard that second cry , not so loud as the first and followed by a long groan .: 56.57
<S> he reflected , but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food , no drug with the wine .: 57.59
<S> if i am not yet a musketeer , said he to his new friends , as he passed through the gateway of m. de tre ville s ho tel , at least i have entered upon my apprenticeship , haven t i ? chapter vi .: 26.57
<S> do you think emmanuel would oblige me ? i will answer for him , count . well ?: 21.05
<S> sometimes , as hamlet says : foul deeds will rise , though all the earth o erwhelm them , to men s eyes ; but , like a phosphoric light , they rise but to mislead .: 147.67
<S> no , do not seek any longer to discover the reason .: 31.38
<S> if , on the contrary , he refuses to do so , it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret . they will not be strangers , they will be friends . ah , but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow ; beauchamp , for instance . so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent . then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp ? i do , and i will tell you why .: 44.39
<S> no one would have thought in looking at this old , weather beaten , floral decked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things , if , in addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided with , it had also a voice .: 171.90
<S> d artagnan !: 11.49
<S> and the name of this lord ? lord de winter . lord de winter ! exclaimed the queen , the friend of my husband .: 20.98
<S> if it were bad money , there might be some hopes ; but unfortunately , those were all good pieces . manage the matter as well as you can , my good man ; it does not concern me , the more so as i have not a livre left . come , said d artagnan , let us inquire further .: 46.03
<S> tis a last resource , but let us not employ it till it is imperatively called for ; let us rather persevere in our researches . they continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted d artagnan to rueil .: 73.75
<S> with respect to aramis , though having the air of having nothing secret about him , he was a young fellow made up of mysteries , answering little to questions put to him about others , and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the musketeer with a princess , wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of his interlocutor .: 70.97
<S> planchet waited , towel on arm ; fourreau uncorked the bottles ; and brisemont , which was the name of the convalescent , poured the wine , which was a little shaken by its journey , carefully into decanters .: 129.59
<S> so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword . marvelous ! exclaimed porthos , looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration .: 32.35
<S> and yet here are two culprits . yes ; but only one of these two is about to die ; the other has many years to live . if the pardon is to come , there is no time to lose . and see , here it is , said the count .: 32.75
<S> seeing a stranger , escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers , and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded , dante s , who guessed the truth , and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come , sprang forward with clasped hands .: 51.19
<S> the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion .: 69.94
<S> yes , replied a gendarme .: 15.13
<S> he then gave himself up to his happiness .: 25.79
<S> but you say you do not wish to kill me ? no . and yet you will let me perish with hunger ? ah , that is a different thing . well , then , wretches , cried danglars , i will defy your infamous calculations i would rather die at once !: 24.92
<S> but because you have paid the price of a slave , do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king ?: 35.69
<S> at this time athos came up to d artagnan .: 11.55
<S> yes , milady , replied athos ; the comte de la fe re in person , who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a visit .: 25.11
<S> but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion , and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy .: 70.80
<S> this was not , however , a rope ladder , but a ball of silk cord , with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs , the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board .: 52.59
<S> the next morning he saw albert pass and repass , holding an enormous bouquet , which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle .: 37.61
<S> project gutenberg ebooks may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically anything in the united states with ebooks not protected by u.s. copyright law .: 14.26
<S> faith , yes , with a haughty presence , a fine equipage ; such as the son of a noble house would have . he will be my companion on the journey , sir , cried raoul .: 53.07
<S> ah , it is you , monsieur !: 11.98
<S> tis done ! they both exclaimed at once .: 83.96
<S> then he pointed to the door .: 10.69
<S> like benefactors in romances , i should have left you without seeing you again , but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength , because i am a weak and vain man , fond of the tender , kind , and thankful glances of my fellow creatures .: 56.54
<S> oh . cried madame de villefort , it is really frightful . madame danglars tried to utter a few words , but was not heard .: 25.99
<S> your probity , replied the stranger , is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety , to ascertain which i am deputed to see you .: 53.69
<S> the count then placed his foot on his head , saying , i know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull , rascal . ah , mercy mercy ! cried caderousse .: 46.67
<S> a pleasure boat with striped awning was going by .: 326.49
<S> so serious that i must take leave of you for a few days ; so , added he , turning to rene e , judge for yourself if it be not important . you are going to leave us ? cried rene e , unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement .: 35.73
<S> silence , child !: 49.82
<S> when the hour appointed for the audience arrived athos was obliged to stay until the queen , who was waited upon by a new deputation from paris , had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving them .: 50.68
<S> perceiving her brother in law , she uttered a terrible cry .: 22.70
<S> dante s led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew ; retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor , and upon their return the jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces .: 84.25
<S> how sprightly you are , said caderousse ; one would say you were already in possession of your property . no , unfortunately ; but when i do obtain it well ? i shall remember old friends , i can tell you that . yes , since you have such a good memory . what do you want ?: 28.83
<S> dante s in his cell heard the noise of preparation , sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner , who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon .: 62.28
<S> conjecture soon became certainty , for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to franz , gradually emerging from the staircase opposite , upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness .: 89.52
<S> he did not , however , lose sight of milady , and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her face .: 27.98
<S> after reading the first lines of the letter mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read .: 34.64
<S> listen , said morcerf if mademoiselle danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account , and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families , i am ready to agree to the arrangement .: 84.94
<S> as they stopped at the door of the cardinal s study , d artagnan was about to be announced when rochefort slapped him on his shoulder .: 21.65
<S> grimaud , nevertheless , was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner ; he wanted to inspire , not a sudden repugnance , but a good , sound , steady hatred ; he retired , therefore , and gave place to four guards , who , having breakfasted , could attend on the prisoner .: 85.46
<S> he was a man of forty to forty five years , but he seemed at least fifty , and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair , which was cut short , in the military fashion .: 42.82
<S> danglars , too , had recognized the bandit , whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris ; and not only did he recognize him , but the cell in which albert had been confined , and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers .: 58.88
<S> i ate some bread and some fruit ; then , remembering the narcotic mixed with the water i had drunk , i would not touch that which was placed on the table , but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table .: 63.61
<S> just then the door opened , and the jailer , addressing himself to bertuccio , said : excuse me , sir , but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner . and so closes our interview , said andrea to the worthy steward ; i wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil ! i will return tomorrow , said bertuccio .: 39.17
<S> it is true that she had not , perhaps , been scrupulously faithful to him , but she had remembered him ; that was something .: 40.89
<S> she did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist ; she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle course .: 57.00
<S> and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine , and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent , that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties , which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief .: 47.94
<S> albert could not understand the banker s look , and turning to monte cristo , who understood it perfectly , did you see , said he , how he looked at me ? yes , said the count ; but did you think there was anything particular in his look ? indeed , i did ; and what does he mean by his news from greece ? how can i tell you ? because i imagine you have correspondents in that country . monte cristo smiled significantly .: 29.47
<S> my recovery lasted six months .: 77.03
<S> athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window , which was without shutters , but had the half curtains closely drawn .: 48.03
<S> then collecting all her remaining strength , she forced herself to close her eyes ; but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame , generally so easy to accomplish , became almost impossible at this moment , so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth .: 99.67
<S> on the following morning at five o clock d artagnan arose , and descending to the kitchen without help , asked , among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us , for some oil , some wine , and some rosemary , and with his mother s recipe in his hand composed a balsam , with which he anointed his numerous wounds , replacing his bandages himself , and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor , d artagnan walked about that same evening , and was almost cured by the morrow .: 72.48
<S> everybody looked and listened with astonishment , comprehending nothing of what passed .: 88.21
<S> do we breakfast or dine ?: 97.52
<S> andrea turned towards them , and with an impertinent smile asked , have you any message for your father , mademoiselle danglars , for in all probability i shall return to paris ? euge nie covered her face with her hands .: 28.21
<S> the whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment .: 44.33
<S> i adore rome , and i have always had a great taste for arch ology . 20189m come , two or three more such adventures , and i do not despair of seeing you a member of the academy . doubtless albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready .: 84.70
<S> but you know him , m. de morcerf . is it that excellent m. bertuccio , who understands hiring windows so well ? yes , you saw him the day i had the honor of receiving you ; he has been a soldier , a smuggler in fact , everything .: 47.77
<S> his itinerary was promptly determined : he would go to dammartin , from which place two roads diverge , one toward soissons , the other toward compiegne ; there he would inquire concerning the bracieux estate and go to the right or to the left according to the information obtained .: 112.60
<S> come , gentlemen , addressing the troop , let us return . stop , exclaimed villequier , so mazarin was here !: 48.41
<S> with folded arms , he gazed for some time upon the great city .: 56.61
<S> in fact , said mordaunt , with a calm voice and immovable countenance , a single blow sufficed . perhaps it was some one in that occupation , said cromwell .: 36.16
<S> surely , answered danglars , one can not be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air . you can , indeed , when the arrow lights point downward on somebody s head . meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form .: 151.08
<S> peppino walked with a firm step , doubtless aware of what awaited him .: 70.16
<S> i would have saved madame de saint me ran , if science could have done it ; but she is dead and my duty regards the living .: 44.88
<S> and yet i have punished her i have dared to tell her i have repent and die ! but no , she must not die ; she shall live , and with me .: 50.04
<S> but , on the contrary , the particulars which are given prove that fernand mondego , raised by ali pasha to the rank of governor general , is no other than count fernand of morcerf ; then , recollecting the honor you had done me , in admitting me to your friendship , i hastened to you . albert , still extended on the chair , covered his face with both hands , as if to prevent the light from reaching him .: 58.25
<S> so much the better ! to that exclamation of porthos s succeeded a groaning , low and profound , which seemed to come from behind a door .: 44.60
<S> everything has succeeded as i expected ; spies , guards , satellites , all took me for you , and the king blesses you while waiting for you to bless him . may god protect you , my son ; for your example has given me at the same time hope and courage . aramis resumed his own attire and left juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse to him .: 59.45
<S> that would compromise the honor of the french army , to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise ; so i have become a gardener , and , consequently , adopted the costume of my calling . what excessive nonsense you talk , maximilian ! nonsense ?: 88.33
<S> have you anything ? nothing . the devil ! said aramis .: 14.93
<S> vain and indiscreet , it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal .: 68.75
<S> i am a ruined man , lost , destroyed ! bah , said athos , we were always dry . if you had been contented with drinking , well and good ; but you have broken all the bottles . you pushed me upon a heap which rolled down .: 59.52
<S> well , just as you like , my prince ; there s liberty for all the world .: 36.56
<S> the king entertained great regard for my father , who had fallen at the siege of arras , and the uniform was granted .: 37.40
<S> she perceived felton , who sat with his back toward her .: 24.66
<S> when he had gone , monte cristo breathed a profound sigh , and said : enough of this poison , let me now seek the antidote . then sounding his bell , he said to ali , who entered : i am going to madame s chamber have the carriage ready at one o clock . chapter 49 .: 57.65
<S> they hang , behead , and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible manner ; but some of these , like clever rogues , have contrived to escape human justice , and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning stratagems .: 116.57
<S> if you are outside the united states , check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading , copying , displaying , performing , distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg work .: 14.66
<S> the man he sacrificed to his ambition , that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father s faults , appeared to him pale and threatening , leading his affianced bride by the hand , and bringing with him remorse , not such as the ancients figured , furious and terrible , but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death .: 100.12
<S> i say that the diamond is real , and that this gentleman , one of the first jewellers of paris , will give us 50,000 francs for it .: 21.41
<S> if the musketeers did not appear , things were to go on as had been agreed ; mme .: 62.32
<S> de saint me ran ? yes . suddenly ? from an apoplectic stroke . an apoplectic stroke ? repeated the doctor .: 37.36
<S> now to supper , said aramis .: 21.01
<S> patrick uttered a loud cry .: 22.95
<S> can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter , which i have just received ? said the astonished athos .: 48.93
<S> at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room .: 38.34
<S> with him , then , you must have seen some of his musketeers ? all those he is in the habit of receiving ! replied milady , for whom this conversation began to have a real interest .: 40.66
<S> well , pardieu ! there is yours , my dear friend , replied d artagnan .: 8.51
<S> i ask it humbly of you , my lord , said he ; sign the order for the liberation of milady de winter .: 28.45
<S> and you say that signor vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of rome ? and with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example . then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him ? why , you see , he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains , the fishermen of the tiber , and the smugglers of the coast .: 52.67
<S> you have scarcely seen my mother ; you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely .: 37.59
<S> the man was one of those puritans , half preacher and half soldier , who swarmed around cromwell .: 91.39
<S> he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left , and went towards the country of paoli and napoleon .: 48.38
<S> the three musketeers . possessed by this idea , the cardinal resolved to know all about d artagnan immediately ; of course he could not inquire from d artagnan himself who he was and what had been his career ; he remarked , however , in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a gascon accent .: 45.02
<S> madame danglars trembled with fear ; villefort started with joy .: 25.44
<S> is this possible , count ? on foot , yes , in a carriage , no . i will go on foot , then . is it important that you should go that way ? yes , there is something i wish to see . well , we will go by the corso .: 29.32
<S> you know my opinion of my mother , count ; look at her , still beautiful , witty , more charming than ever .: 30.71
<S> soon strange fact aramis undid two buttons of his doublet , seeing which , porthos unfastened his entirely .: 304.84
<S> ah , perbacco , indispensable , were they ? certainly they were ; supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child ? true , said the major , there might be doubts raised . in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated . it would be fatal to his interests . it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance . o peccato ! you must know that in france they are very particular on these points ; it is not sufficient , as in italy , to go to the priest and say , we love each other , and want you to marry us . marriage is a civil affair in france , and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity . that is the misfortune !: 85.95
<S> it seems that he is a spaniard .: 18.66
<S> as to the rest , in eight days you will be where you ought to be , and my task will be completed . infamous task !: 48.19
<S> we might say that was his dream .: 35.43
<S> it is well , madame , i believe your oath . no , no , read , exclaimed the queen , indignantly ; read , i command you , for i am resolved that everything shall be finished to night and never will i recur to this subject again .: 46.42
<S> madame , wait at the door , whilst i shall be at the head of the king s bed , ready to die for him . laporte went out ; the queen remained standing near the hangings , whilst d artagnan glided behind the curtains .: 29.04
<S> yes , yes , he said , i will pardon you if you tell me all . oh ! cried the executioner , all !: 15.20
<S> pardon my eagerness , for my life depends on your answer .: 57.41
<S> know , then , what manner of woman it was for whom to day you call me to account .: 86.46
<S> can not i serve you as a waiting maid ?: 93.42
<S> correcting himself immediately , he said , excuse me , sir ; hope alone makes me almost mad , what will not reality do ? but , said danglars , who , on his part , did not perceive how soon the conversation , which was at first disinterested , was turning to a business transaction , there is , doubtless , a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you ? which ? asked the young man .: 55.66
<S> the fourth horse had arrived .: 36.88
<S> besides , i long ago determined to put an end to all these petty intrigues of policy and love .: 85.43
<S> scarcely had the two frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valet de chambre called out : make ready ! at the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out : la bruyere and du barthois !: 47.64
<S> a moment after , those who , surprised by this tumult , had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it , saw the door open , and four men , clothed in black , not come out of it , but fly , like so many frightened crows , leaving on the ground and on the corners of the furniture , feathers from their wings ; that is to say , patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks .: 42.88
<S> then going around the house i placed grimaud at the other exit , and here i am .: 53.64
<S> he thought several times of the project the count had of visiting paris ; and he had no doubt but that , with his eccentric character , his characteristic face , and his colossal fortune , he would produce a great effect there .: 55.16
<S> both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay .: 44.59
<S> we discoursed a long time , madame , on different subjects ; of perugino , of raphael , of manners , customs , of the famous aqua tofana , of which they had told you , i think you said , that certain individuals in perugia had preserved the secret . yes , true , replied madame de villefort , somewhat uneasily , i remember now . i do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed , madame , continued the count with perfect calmness ; but i perfectly remember that , falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me , you consulted me as to the health of mademoiselle de villefort . yes , really , sir , you were in fact a medical man , said madame de villefort , since you had cured the sick . molie re or beaumarchais would reply to you , madame , that it was precisely because i was not , that i had cured my patients ; for myself , i am content to say to you that i have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply , but still only as an amateur , you understand . at this moment the clock struck six .: 41.80
<S> the guards were unable to help any one each one was occupied with his self preservation .: 73.50
<S> it was about half past nine .: 15.59
<S> when he was only a few paces from me , i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade .: 44.80
<S> poor dear man , he is innocence itself ! and something like a faint smile lighted the still terrified features of the young woman .: 70.35
<S> she continued , then , as if she had not heard his exclamation , or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to it .: 24.64
<S> as soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event , she had ordered the anchor to be weighed .: 46.46
<S> i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler , with the severe discipline on board , would have a salutary effect on his character , which was now well nigh , if not quite , corrupt .: 72.83
<S> each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas , which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea .: 61.47
<S> this last reason appeared convincing .: 114.38
<S> he stood with his arms folded , apparently as calm as any man could be in such circumstances .: 44.02
<S> vampa took cucumetto s body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto , while in her turn teresa remained outside .: 37.64
<S> let us sit down to supper .: 14.09
<S> so much the better ; the more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied . m .: 42.54
<S> i really did not observe whom i had the honor to receive under my poor roof .: 42.27
<S> within two leagues of this place , at the inn of the red dovecot . in that case i am lost , said d artagnan .: 21.96
<S> what wants your excellency of me ? inquired the man , retreating a step or two , as if to keep on his guard .: 38.68
<S> a procurator s dinner chapter xxxiii .: 29.75
<S> ah , sir , exclaimed cocles , what can it mean ? the pharaon ? come , dear ones , said morrel , rising from his seat , let us go and see , and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence ! they all went out , and on the stairs met madame morrel , who had been afraid to go up into the study .: 34.68
<S> bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world .: 47.86
<S> at this moment one of his penitents passed , and as she was young and pretty aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile .: 36.20
<S> ah , said d artagnan , i did not see that ; it was the sword of the comte de wardes which made that hole , when he gave me a good thrust in the breast . you are wounded ? asked buckingham , as he opened the letter .: 29.16
<S> yes , and without violence , said louise .: 34.10
<S> so much the better so much the better !: 11.50
<S> we dined so very late , hastily interposed la carconte .: 127.05
<S> well , sirs ! cried the queen , on perceiving the two friends , you have come , faithful friends !: 17.32
<S> he then returned to the captain , said a few words to him , and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command , he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately .: 33.85
<S> grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain , and at nine o clock in the morning , having a fair wind , our frenchmen set foot on their native land .: 54.03
<S> i do not like to have simple soldiers , because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps , thus to play the great lords ; discipline is the same for them as for everybody else . athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely , and bowed in sign of assent .: 59.30
<S> the king saw the four gentlemen come in , but appeared to take no notice of them .: 26.89
<S> sir , replied the wounded man , believe me , there is no time to lose ; the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines . are you a surgeon ? asked de guiche .: 24.52
<S> ah , said he , i hear a human voice . edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years ; and a jailer is no man to a prisoner he is a living door , a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron .: 82.45
<S> well , madame ? unhesitatingly repeated debray .: 53.23
<S> the one you bought will then become useless to you ? nearly so . and you selected it yourself ? with the greatest care .: 83.87
<S> we have him ! cried the horsemen , rushing on d artagnan with naked swords .: 44.72
<S> aramis and i are very unhappy ; but god , our courage , and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us .: 64.87
<S> he called for d artagnan , but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him , d artagnan not being on service .: 51.18
<S> d e pinay , said he , allow me to remind you at this moment , which is perhaps not so ill chosen as at first sight may appear , for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomb , allow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by madame de saint me ran on her death bed , that valentine s wedding might not be deferred .: 46.79
<S> the prince leaped to his feet , extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound , there was no mistaking it it was the noise of cannon .: 35.18
<S> i see , my lord , i am to be taken back to the bastile . you are sagacious . i shall return thither , my lord , but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me . you ?: 24.54
<S> milady arose .: 23.56
<S> upon his return to the hotel , franz found albert in his dressing gown and slippers , listlessly extended on a sofa , smoking a cigar .: 44.85
<S> the red duke ! cried porthos , clapping his hands and nodding his head .: 26.30
<S> she wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night ; and poor kitty , pale and trembling , awaited d artagnan s reply .: 30.90
<S> good , so much the better , said caderousse , his eyes sparkling with avarice .: 15.19
<S> he descended , or rather seemed to descend , several steps , inhaling the fresh and balmy air , like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe , formed from such perfumes as set the mind a dreaming , and such fires as burn the very senses ; and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep , from sinbad , his singular host , to ali , the mute attendant ; then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes , like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished , and he was again in the chamber of statues , lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure .: 88.13
<S> comminges went out with a soldier s passive obedience .: 46.35
<S> what is it ? said d artagnan , with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance .: 29.04
<S> he profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd , without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him .: 92.36
<S> nevertheless , knowing the weakness of her husband , and more particularly his cupidity , she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose .: 47.66
<S> i will teach you how to laugh to morrow but in another manner . but whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the palais royal , to increase the hilarity of the queen , mazarin , a man of sense , and whose fear , moreover , gave him foresight , lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes ; he went out after the coadjutor , settled his account , locked up his gold , and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls .: 69.95
<S> what to do ? there would be a very simple means , very natural tell me what ! to wait , concealed in the neighborhood , and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for you . but where can i wait ? oh , there is no difficulty in that .: 45.14
<S> is monsieur your brother ? said d artagnan , not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing .: 35.06
<S> escape as lord de winter had thought , milady s wound was not dangerous .: 68.77
<S> here i am , my lord . did you remark that man who is following us ? yes , my lord . who is he ? i do not know , only he has followed your grace from the palais royal , stopped at the louvre to wait for you , and now leaves the louvre with you . some spy of the cardinal , said de winter to him , aside .: 29.02
<S> well !: 14.47
<S> most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility : www.gutenberg.org .: 112.65
<S> is it my affair ?: 21.66
<S> was he the man that stabbed you ? yes , said the executioner .: 23.95
<S> handle the musket and the sword , my dear fellow .: 40.24
<S> that is a long time ; but it is something that you believe so .: 19.03
<S> involuntarily his languid eyes closed , and still through his eyelashes a well known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped .: 65.77
<S> to the sloop , said felton , and row quickly . the four men bent to their oars , but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of it .: 53.99
<S> for in truth , i think i have hitherto been deceived in you .: 29.83
<S> you have once before thrown yourself in my path .: 68.89
<S> raoul had desired to be awakened should grimaud arrive , but grimaud did not arrive .: 86.03
<S> as they approached the piazza del popolo , the crowd became more dense , and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible : the obelisk , surmounted by a cross , which marks the centre of the square , and in front of the obelisk , at the point where the three streets , del babuino , del corso , and di ripetta , meet , the two uprights of the scaffold , between which glittered the curved knife of the mandai a .: 53.08
<S> all this was done in silence , and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken .: 36.03
<S> then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees , which were nearly divested of foliage , madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand , the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son , or to throw back his elastic ball , which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden .: 51.58
<S> by degrees the wind abated , vast gray clouds rolled towards the west , and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars .: 56.02
<S> she might say that athos had hanged her ; but then athos would tell that she was branded .: 56.56
<S> and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard , and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window , which was broken by the explosion .: 31.73
<S> eleven o clock had struck .: 24.45
<S> you were among them you were !: 73.64
<S> but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage , gave a fresh turn to his ideas , and inspired him with new courage .: 45.37
<S> while d artagnan was examining mme .: 27.08
<S> you can suppose , porthos , that what i have to say relates to most important matters . devil take them ; let us walk in the park , answered porthos , for the sake of digestion . egad , said d artagnan , the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren ; you are a happy man , my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase , but acquired that of fishing . my friend , replied porthos , i leave fishing to mousqueton , it is a vulgar pleasure , but i shoot sometimes ; that is to say , when i am dull , and i sit on one of those marble seats , have my gun brought to me , my favorite dog , and i shoot rabbits . really , how very amusing ! yes , replied porthos , with a sigh , it is amusing . d artagnan now no longer counted the sighs .: 52.02
<S> they then rang the bell , and carrying away four swords out of five , they took their road , intoxicated with joy , toward the ho tel of m. de tre ville .: 27.36
<S> i sleep no longer , monsieur .: 35.24
<S> and now , continued he , with one of his most charming smiles , having finished talking to the father in law , i must address myself to the banker . and what may you have to say to him ? said danglars , laughing in his turn .: 20.00
<S> i come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky . it is not like this , then , said porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain .: 57.26
<S> i had informed m. morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually , and he has been here within the last half hour to tell me that if his ship , the pharaon , did not come into port on the 15th , he would be wholly unable to make this payment . but , said the englishman , this looks very much like a suspension of payment . it looks more like bankruptcy ! exclaimed m. de boville despairingly .: 50.21
<S> but this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger , perhaps death . he he incur danger of death !: 103.62
<S> at the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore , and holding a spy glass in his hand .: 49.44
<S> a private room had been prepared for the king and another for monsieur .: 52.25
<S> as our house is carried on very regularly , and we make out our bills every week , at the end of eight days we presented our account ; but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky moment , for at the first word on the subject , he sent us to all the devils .: 51.33
<S> now , my lord , said the poor man , let me have the poire d angoisse .: 15.45
<S> please follow me , and he went on before , followed by athos and aramis .: 25.69
<S> there was a moment s silence , then the carriage cleared the gate .: 17.42
<S> she passed an hour without breathing , panting , with a cold sweat upon her brow , and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor .: 45.37
<S> well , then ? asked athos , in a low tone .: 7.45
<S> d artagnan had , with his sword , cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed .: 48.80
<S> a long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his shoulders , disclosing in front the splendid baldric , from which was suspended a gigantic rapier .: 111.62
<S> i will repair it , indeed i will , my dear porthos . besides , what did i ask of you ? resumed porthos , with a movement of the shoulders full of good fellowship .: 27.24
<S> it was easy to call his jailer s attention to the noise , and watch his countenance as he listened ; but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity ?: 83.23
<S> there was a moment s silence , it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body .: 13.02
<S> jackson , said he , go instantly to the lord chancellor , and tell him that i charge him with the execution of these orders .: 48.20
<S> porthos rested his chin on his hands , placed his elbows on the table and looked at d artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of good fellowship .: 30.85
<S> but this is a needless quarrel you seek with me , as it seems to me . parbleu ! what do you desire it to be ? what do you want ? would you like to know ? certainly . well , then , i wish that order of which you are bearer , seeing that i have not one of my own and must have one . you jest , i presume . i never jest . let me pass ! you shall not pass . my brave young man , i will blow out your brains .: 33.22
<S> go . the valet bowed and retired , and albert returned to his inventory .: 32.80
<S> it is not known whether it was the devil who gave way , or the monks who grew tired ; but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible possessed that ever existed .: 63.68
<S> ha ! said rochefort , you are right .: 14.69
<S> the duc de bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his principality of sedan , and the title of prince , granted to him and to those belonging to his house .: 39.73
<S> au revoir , benedetto ; and running into a court , he disappeared .: 56.37
<S> get me out of this , in heaven s name ! he said , or i shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men . a great tumult arose , in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard .: 34.92
<S> was that it ? if , god willing , these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence , said d artagnan , i shall venture to express a wish , which is , that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavy for with these three men your eminence may rouse all europe if you like . these gascons , said the cardinal , laughing , almost beat the italians in effrontery . at all events , answered d artagnan , with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinal s , they beat them when they draw their swords . he then withdrew , and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money .: 59.85
<S> well , edmond , i swear to you , by the head of that son for whom i entreat your pity , edmond , for ten years i saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy , and for ten years i heard every night the cry which awoke me , shuddering and cold .: 45.60
<S> we are leaving paris , and when our journey is paid , we shall have 5,000 francs left . the blood mounted to the temples of debray , who held a million in his pocket book , and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting that the same house had contained two women , one of whom , justly dishonored , had left it poor with 1,500,000 francs under her cloak , while the other , unjustly stricken , but sublime in her misfortune , was yet rich with a few deniers .: 59.00
<S> you , who have arranged your infernal plans , and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous ?: 127.97
<S> he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning .: 28.46
<S> only imagine me a captain at twenty , with a hundred louis pay , and a share in the profits !: 86.70
<S> count , what am i bound to do , being in possession of this secret ? my dear friend , said monte cristo , you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart .: 32.18
<S> the ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass .: 53.54
<S> the first will be mazzolato , the second decapitato . yes , continued the count , it was at first arranged in this way ; but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony . really ? said franz .: 29.84
<S> allow me , then , sire , to intercede for her with your majesty . let her humble herself , then , and come to me first . on the contrary , sire , set the example .: 33.71
<S> i should be too happy to be of any service to her .: 31.09
<S> in great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other ; and , young as i was , i quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads . albert had often heard not from his father , for he never spoke on the subject , but from strangers the description of the last moments of the vizier of yanina ; he had read different accounts of his death , but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl , and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him .: 69.11
<S> he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl .: 65.49
<S> you say you fear nothing but death ? i did not say that i feared it ; i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans . and old age ? my end will be achieved before i grow old . and madness ? i have been nearly mad ; and you know the axiom , non bis in idem .: 73.52
<S> they had seen no one .: 22.40
<S> ah , sir , do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that i may have some things i am in need of ! it shall be done , replied bertuccio .: 36.17
<S> i said , my good fellow , that i would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos , pistols , carbines , and blunderbusses included .: 96.94
<S> what would you have ? said monte cristo ; we are all mortal .: 17.37
<S> but there was no getting at the place of sojourn of the future abbe ; the defiles of the chamber of aramis were as well guarded as the gardens of armida .: 42.88
<S> they advanced silently , the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark .: 63.43
<S> no , madame , replied monte cristo ; but you see i make no resistance . we are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove . the count looked at merce de s as if to interrogate her , but she continued to walk on in silence , and he refrained from speaking .: 23.04
<S> yes . you have a recipe for it ? an infallible one . that would be invaluable to us in africa , who have not always any food to eat , and rarely anything to drink . yes , said monte cristo ; but , unfortunately , a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army , which might not awake when it was needed . may we inquire what is this recipe ? asked debray .: 52.83
<S> one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow ; but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly .: 213.82
<S> suddenly an idea occurred to him he smiled , and the perspiration dried on his forehead .: 46.20
<S> the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat ; and monsieur porthos , finding himself at the mercy of his adversary , acknowledged himself conquered .: 39.04
<S> in ten minutes luigi and the traveller reached the cross roads .: 66.94
<S> a retired baker ? asked the fruiteress .: 20.08
<S> his name is said she , in her turn .: 21.87
<S> well , my boys , said the brigadier , the brigand must really have escaped early this morning ; but we will send to the villers coterets and noyon roads , and search the forest , when we shall catch him , no doubt . the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus , in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie , when a loud scream , accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell , resounded through the court of the hotel .: 57.15
<S> and then he was older than any of us , added d artagnan .: 31.55
<S> monsieur , said mademoiselle d aubigne to scarron , as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul , do you not admire monsieur voiture s friends ?: 45.14
<S> morrel was there ; he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed .: 30.39
<S> and you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher ? yes , monsieur , and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a line .: 44.81
<S> the indictment chapter 111 .: 37.11
<S> what could be his intentions towards him ?: 44.84
<S> may god accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences ! valentine seized the count s hand , and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lips .: 50.59
<S> and you fellows , resumed mousqueton , stay near monsieur le comte d artagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst i go to prepare my lord for his visit . and mounting his horse mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop .: 82.99
<S> he thought that , beginning to be afraid , they had stayed behind , and he continued to advance .: 30.13
<S> english and french the hour having come , they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind the luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats .: 96.45
<S> they will believe he is arrested , and that will give him time ; in three days i will tell them who i am , and they can not fail to let me go . bravo , athos !: 25.56
<S> who told you so ?: 31.12
<S> a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house .: 64.55
<S> on him , on him , always on him !: 62.63
<S> his misery was depicted in sinister lines on his countenance .: 54.87
<S> it seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking , about which i did not dare to question you , since you told me nothing .: 34.02
<S> athos , whose acquaintance i made about that period , and porthos , who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective tricks of fence , prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a musketeer .: 73.54
<S> oh , no !: 9.87
<S> the 28th of february , 1815 , at half past two in the afternoon . today is the 30th of july , 1816 , why , it is but seventeen months . only seventeen months , replied dante s .: 34.34
<S> the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl , absorbed by her affection , and he also , like morrel , followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover .: 79.32
<S> the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court , receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered , and all the honor due to his rank .: 50.53
<S> follow me , mr. commissary ! said the brigadier ; tread in my steps . wait an instant , said the host ; number 3 has two staircases , inside and outside . good , said the brigadier .: 65.93
<S> the door opened ; two guards received bonacieux in their arms from the officer who supported him .: 48.62
<S> i had been told that you had endeavored to escape ; that you had taken the place of another prisoner ; that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body ; that you had been thrown alive from the top of the cha teau d if , and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers .: 39.82
<S> when the evening came i was so weak that every time i fainted i thanked god , for i thought i was about to die .: 57.78
<S> just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge .: 65.49
<S> he then asked with whom he played .: 60.88
<S> while the count smiled at hearing this song , which made him lose sight of andrea in the recollection of benedetto , madame danglars was boasting to monte cristo of her husband s strength of mind , who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at milan .: 47.99
<S> i have pledged my last jewels , sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants , who refused to accompany him unless i made this sacrifice .: 68.27
<S> certainly , in the eyes of an artist , the exact and strict costume of teresa had a very different character from that of carmela and her companions ; and teresa was frivolous and coquettish , and thus the embroidery and muslins , the cashmere waist girdles , all dazzled her , and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain .: 68.43
<S> he drew back terrified .: 50.49
<S> in the meantime d artagnan , who had plunged into a bypath , continued his route and reached st .: 26.53
<S> here , excellency , said peppino , offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork .: 51.11
<S> you are right , sir , said athos .: 5.36
<S> a cup of chocolate . i did not ask for it .: 25.85
<S> now , as ever , i am nothing but your servant . then turning to his men : allow these gentlemen to pass , he said ; they are friends of the duc de beaufort . long live the duc de beaufort ! cried the sentinels .: 33.51
<S> how old was she ? franz assured me , replied albert , that she was sixty six years old .: 49.75
<S> pooh ! said athos , trying to smile in his turn .: 11.41
<S> to delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh offense .: 85.02
<S> mordaunt went away with the captain .: 38.95
<S> d artagnan remained standing and examined this man .: 20.08
<S> i will call thee mouston ; and if it makes thee happy i will not tutoyer you any longer . oh ! cried mousqueton , reddening with joy ; if you do me , sir , such honor , i shall be grateful all my life ; it is too much to ask . alas ! thought d artagnan , it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations i am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me . will monsieur remain long with us ? asked mousqueton , with a serene and glowing countenance .: 51.75
<S> he therefore looked forward to six o clock with as much impatience as the duke himself .: 36.85
<S> oh , heavens , exclaimed monte cristo , can my suspicions be correct ?: 24.99
<S> the door being closed , the four friends waited in expectation .: 31.04
<S> fire ! cried mordaunt ; fire upon them ! three or four shots were fired , but with no other result than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and sound .: 77.44
<S> may i not go and see my friends ? yes , sir , you shall see them .: 21.61
<S> yes , replied aramis , and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination ; now , continued he , if only de winter does not keep us waiting .: 62.31
<S> peste ! said d artagnan to porthos .: 7.66
<S> but andrea , turning towards them , winked his eyes , rolled his tongue around his cheeks , and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent .: 48.07
<S> the next morn broke off the coast of aleria ; all day they coasted , and in the evening saw fires lighted on land ; the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing , for a ship s lantern was hung up at the mast head instead of the streamer , and they came to within a gunshot of the shore .: 84.24
<S> can i be deceived ? he murmured , as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket . never mind , we shall see !: 55.52
<S> a table , ready set out , awaited them .: 56.23
<S> d artagnan did the same , with a little more concern , however , for the noble creatures , whose merits he fully appreciated ; but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables , and busy themselves with the steeds .: 51.43
<S> nevertheless , after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull ; and the count s agreeable voice , his gentle and persuasive eloquence , recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos , the most amusing and the best informed of guides .: 93.83
<S> it is m. franz de quesnel , baron d e pinay . while his wife was speaking , villefort had narrowly watched the old man s countenance .: 24.32
<S> d artagnan turned toward her , saying , then send him away , madame . pooh ! said the swiss , who had needed a little time to take in d artagnan s proposal , pooh !: 41.80
<S> he is a very strange man , she said , and in my opinion is himself the adelmonte he talks about . as to monte cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations .: 56.27
<S> merce de s raised her head , and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her .: 13.84
<S> can he be inconstant before being happy ? oh , no ; he must have been prevented by monsieur de tre ville or monsieur dessessart .: 38.00
<S> supposing that after having eaten the leather they eat the soles , i can not see much that is left unless they eat one another . poor fools ! said athos , emptying a glass of excellent bordeaux wine which , without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys , merited it no less , poor fools !: 80.82
<S> i am not your uncle , i know you not . my uncle , replied mordaunt , with his harsh and bantering tone , you are mistaken ; you will not have me turned out this time as you did in london you dare not .: 29.40
<S> morcerf , usually so stiff and formal , accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner , and , feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received , he did not consider it necessary to adopt any man uvres in order to gain his end , but went at once straight to the point .: 56.24
<S> at the noise made by d artagnan in entering , aramis lifted up his head , and beheld his friend ; but to the great astonishment of the young man , the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the musketeer , so completely was his mind detached from the things of this world .: 40.55
<S> only as they went out aramis placed his hand upon the arm of d artagnan , and looking at him earnestly , you have not spoken of this lady ? said he .: 26.96
<S> have you been satisfied with him this voyage ? that is according to the sense you attach to the question , sir .: 42.14
<S> i hope it does not exceed she stopped ; speech failed her .: 109.15
<S> it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill tempered .: 42.30
<S> you must take grimaud and olivain . both , sir ? asked raoul , astonished .: 36.48
<S> he was alone alone with these countless , these unheard of treasures !: 77.55
<S> as soon as the earnest money was paid , d artagnan took possession of his lodging , and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an almost new doublet of the elder m. d artagnan , and which she had given her son secretly .: 47.53
<S> by degrees everyone awoke .: 50.14
<S> bravo ! repeated the sailors .: 22.02
<S> your eminence may believe , added d artagnan , that we would have come to meet you , if we could have supposed it was monseigneur coming toward us with so few attendants . the cardinal bit his mustache , and even his lips a little .: 39.16
<S> to return instantly to england , and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves london . and as to my other instructions ? asked the fair traveler .: 57.07
<S> now you are a man , and are able to give me advice ; yet i repeat to you , albert , be prudent . why , my dear mother , it is necessary , in order to make your advice turn to account , that i should know beforehand what i have to distrust .: 29.02
<S> then he began to search .: 30.05
<S> now , my excellent signor pastrini , said franz , addressing his landlord , since we are both ready , do you think we may proceed at once to visit the count of monte cristo ? most assuredly , replied he .: 30.41
<S> unhappily , those times are past . nonsense !: 166.46
<S> in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance , not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier , but also of the duties of a man ; and he thus gained the name of the stoic . we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it , and did not even know what it meant .: 71.35
<S> the door was scarcely closed when albert bent his steps to his mother s room ; and , no one being there to announce him , he advanced to her bedchamber , and distressed by what he saw and guessed , stopped for one moment at the door .: 37.49
<S> but the night was cold , dull , and rainy , and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was non capisco . 50241m danglars therefore continued to sleep , saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting house .: 63.93
<S> the rue richelieu and the rue villedot were then , owing to their vicinity to the ramparts , less frequented than any others in that direction , for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout .: 59.95
<S> athos , who imagined that he saw him move , was the first to go up to him .: 19.62
<S> well , if he is dead , said athos , he has not been so long , for he is still warm .: 15.41
<S> how can a young man live upon 5,000 francs a month ? but you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more do not advance it ; the father will never repay it .: 60.24
<S> i certainly never will get drunk again , d artagnan ; it is too bad a habit . d artagnan remained silent ; and then changing the conversation all at once , athos said : by the by , i thank you for the horse you have brought me . is it to your mind ? asked d artagnan .: 35.95
<S> give him the despatch , raoul !: 38.11
<S> now i remember quite well , that on the table round which they were sitting were pens , ink , and paper .: 43.58
<S> am i to be captured ? he cried ; no , not if i can use more activity than my enemies .: 52.97
<S> will you sell him to me for that sum ? no ; but i will play for him . what ? at dice . no sooner said than done , and i lost the horse .: 50.05
<S> the queen can not you make allowances for the pettishness of a queen and a princess ?: 44.29
<S> adieu , sir , said the magistrate , who had risen from his seat ; i leave you , bearing a remembrance of you a remembrance of esteem , which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better ; for i am not a man to bore my friends , as you will learn .: 29.70
<S> franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the moccoli , and that he had lost sight of him in the via macello .: 17.34
<S> upon a word from her , i would betray my country , i would betray my king , i would betray my god .: 40.62
<S> instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic , he had watered it this time with a solution of salts , having their basis in strychnine , strychnos colubrina , as the learned term it .: 111.26
<S> he called for me at seven o clock , and , before anyone had arrived , asked one of the door keepers to place me in a box .: 40.28
<S> let us manage it better .: 40.52
<S> ali was on the box , in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo .: 38.77
<S> i have ordered masses for myself , and for you , gentlemen , which will be said , gentlemen , for which i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited . and i , said porthos , do you think my strain cost me nothing ? without reckoning mousqueton s wound , for which i had to have the surgeon twice a day , and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show to an apothecary ; so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any more . ay , ay ! said athos , exchanging a smile with d artagnan and aramis , it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad ; that is like a good master . in short , said porthos , when all my expenses are paid , i shall have , at most , thirty crowns left . and i about ten pistoles , said aramis .: 59.89
<S> these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them , and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them this is my treasure , my beloved friend , and with this you have made me rich and happy .: 34.40
<S> it is no use , said the old man , there is no wine . what , no wine ? said dante s , turning pale , and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards .: 24.36
<S> this woman gave all the requisite particulars , and it was intrusted to her . but you should have inquired for the woman ; you should have traced her . and what do you think i did ?: 43.62
<S> still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him , and he called a second and third time ; still no answer .: 69.22
<S> when i ring once , it is for my valet ; twice , for my majordomo ; thrice , for my steward , thus i do not waste a minute or a word .: 73.09
<S> must i use any password to procure a horse ? only dismount ; another will be immediately saddled . albert hesitated a moment .: 106.76
<S> the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .: 25.39
<S> i do not feel remorse , because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction .: 57.22
<S> my heart told me what your mouth has just confirmed that is to say , with what view you have exposed yourself to the dangers of a sea so perilous , or at least so troublesome at this moment and i sent my cutter to meet you .: 66.13
<S> she was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart ; and yet milady at the same time detested and despised this weak fanatic .: 57.73
<S> one terrible idea pressed upon her mind , that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her , and who was about to endeavor to do so again .: 36.68
<S> now , sir , pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you , as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron .: 27.98
<S> so , if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first oh !: 125.46
<S> the two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of persian silk worked with gold , and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles .: 46.43
<S> queen elizabeth and catherine ii .: 120.55
<S> and now , said d artagnan , to the governor s. but you are wounded , it seems , said planchet .: 18.76
<S> this rough appeal , marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he spoke in italian or spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking french , was uttered with such impenetrable expression that gondy , clever physiognomist as he was , had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued .: 98.75
<S> it was a very near thing , but he is not dead . as he said this , d artagnan gave a glance at parry , who was standing in front of the king , to show him that the news was meant for him .: 22.92
<S> i remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very much .: 108.88
<S> then d artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church , and how he had found that lady who , with the seigneur in the black cloak and with the scar near his temple , filled his mind constantly .: 57.32
<S> peste ! matters are going all right . should you know those doors again ? yes . do you know the numbers ? yes . what are they ? no .: 48.53
<S> the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release ; the second , two ; the third , three ; and so on progressively .: 84.61
<S> the anjou wine chapter xliii .: 80.08
<S> the white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney .: 86.97
<S> all was vain ; and he lost two hours in his attempts , which were at last utterly useless .: 64.19
<S> by heavens , exclaimed monte cristo , starting back , it is ali raised his hatchet .: 56.25
<S> the blade was red , for the blood had become rust ; after a momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning , he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary shudder .: 52.61
<S> this vexes you ? said athos .: 20.95
<S> yes , the servant has given his description .: 27.47
<S> pistache , my friend , come here .: 31.42
<S> what avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall ?: 700.51
<S> queen !: 83.52
<S> the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest planchet , who , with the two horses in hand , awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret , before which d artagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence .: 57.20
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> what do you tell me ? truth , my friend .: 12.19
<S> and her mother , madame de saint remy , have they yet told her of it ? no , sir , madame de saint remy is at blois with the duchess of orleans .: 25.70
<S> m. de tre ville had intimated to them his majesty s fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of may , and they must immediately prepare their outfits .: 84.87
<S> it is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond .: 26.66
<S> this last apartment was a sort of dark room , littered with papers .: 46.22
<S> i gave her good advice , by which she did not profit .: 47.24
<S> and , morbleu , why do you not go yourself ?: 33.28
<S> sir , he said , i can tell you what is at present unknown to her majesty .: 18.58
<S> at the extremity of the village planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of aramis , and stopped underneath the window which had light in it .: 42.44
<S> proceed ! said he to the host .: 15.01
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> it is not your father or madame de villefort who is ill. as for you , although we doctors can not divest our patients of nerves , i fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field . valentine colored .: 77.66
<S> two hours afterwards , madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count , in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays , protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman s regrets .: 54.16
<S> now , said the old man , aid me to bury my child . carlini fetched two pickaxes ; and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak , beneath which the young girl was to repose .: 35.17
<S> athos was at home , emptying sadly a bottle of the famous spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into picardy .: 52.77
<S> in fact , the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was , rubbing their hands , for it was cold , it being the month of february .: 39.26
<S> everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour , and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues .: 66.66
<S> do you want any money ? no , sir ; i have all my pay to take nearly three months wages . you are a careful fellow , edmond . say i have a poor father , sir . yes , yes , i know how good a son you are , so now hasten away to see your father .: 39.31
<S> i then resolved to go up to him at all risks .: 26.91
<S> caderousse had once more parted with his treasure the banknotes were replaced in the pocket book , the gold put back into the bag , and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard .: 80.93
<S> the foundation s ein or federal tax identification number is 64 6221541 .: 19.40
<S> mother , said the young man , looking alternately at madame morrel and her daughter , what has occurred what has happened ?: 20.14
<S> you see i can not escape , even if i intended . unless you are blind , or have never been outside the harbor , you must know . i do not . look round you then . dante s rose and looked forward , when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the cha teau d if .: 48.47
<S> on the evening of the 4th of september , m. morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study .: 19.53
<S> is he accompanied ? yes ; by a lackey named lubin . we will keep a sharp lookout for them ; and if we lay hands on them his eminence may be assured they will be reconducted to paris under a good escort . and by doing so , monsieur the governor , said d artagnan , you will deserve well of the cardinal . shall you see him on your return , monsieur count ? without a doubt . tell him , i beg you , that i am his humble servant . i will not fail . delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport and delivered it to d artagnan .: 42.13
<S> it is very well for you , who risk your life every day , but for me , who only did so once we gather from all this , baron , that captain morrel saved your life . exactly so . on what occasion ? asked beauchamp .: 57.45
<S> coquenard , who knew that a simple minded procurator was a very rare variety in the species , smiled a little , and colored a great deal .: 68.70
<S> aramis , cried athos , i am arrested . good , replied aramis , calmly .: 23.09
<S> the four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king .: 54.84
<S> constance . madame bonacieux !: 123.25
<S> i know what i wish to know ; follow me . the three musketeers passed behind his eminence , who again enveloped his face in his cloak , and put his horse in motion , keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions .: 32.04
<S> the unknown chapter 26 .: 25.81
<S> i am pleased with one place , and stay there ; i get tired of it , and leave it ; i am free as a bird and have wings like one ; my attendants obey my slightest wish .: 75.52
<S> one fine morning , then , his yacht , followed by the little fishing boat , boldly entered the port of marseilles , and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence , on the never to be forgotten night of his departure for the cha teau d if , he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither .: 53.68
<S> the devil take the madman ! murmured m. de tre ville , unless , added he , this is a cunning mode of escaping , seeing that he had failed in his purpose ! chapter iv .: 33.97
<S> nay , dear mother , say the accused person .: 71.36
<S> take my wealth , my fortune , my glory , all the days i have to live , for such an instant , for a night like that .: 37.81
<S> the major recovered his self possession .: 48.82
<S> d artagnan replied in such a manner that kitty remained in her great delusion .: 42.47
<S> how is it that we , four men who have faced armies without blinking , begin to tremble at the mention of a child ? it is true , said athos , but this child comes in the name of heaven . and very soon they left the inn .: 40.41
<S> inspector , continued the governor , i can tell you the story as well as he , for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years . that proves , returned the abbe , that you are like those of holy writ , who having eyes see not , and having ears hear not . my dear sir , the government is rich and does not want your treasures , replied the inspector ; keep them until you are liberated . the abbe s eyes glistened ; he seized the inspector s hand .: 45.63
<S> so , my dear host , be not uneasy , and continue to take all the care of him that his situation requires . monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurator s wife , and not to say a word of the wound ? that s agreed ; you have my word . oh , he would kill me ! don t be afraid ; he is not so much of a devil as he appears . saying these words , d artagnan went upstairs , leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much interested his debt and his life .: 37.84
<S> you know there s only one way of saying things , so i went in and said , my lord , we were not the strongest party . yes , i know that , he said , but give me the particulars . you know , porthos , i could not give him the particulars without naming our friends ; to name them would be to commit them to ruin , so i merely said they were fifty and we were two .: 56.20
<S> d artagnan , who had secured the key , shut himself up in the closet without reply .: 23.14
<S> he only felt one uneasiness , and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends .: 59.15
<S> the number thirteen was always fatal to me ; it was on the thirteenth of july that ventrebleu ! cried d artagnan , rising from the table , the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding one .: 47.66
<S> mazarin now understood that cromwell s envoy desired to retain his incognito .: 102.62
<S> then remarking the strange expression of milady s countenance , she said , pardon me , madame ; you know him by what title ? why , replied milady , embarrassed , why , by the title of friend . you deceive me , madame , said the novice ; you have been his mistress ! it is you who have been his mistress , madame ! cried milady , in her turn .: 23.23
<S> and yet , notwithstanding this want of respect , he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his veins passion drunk with contempt ; but passion or thirst , as the reader pleases .: 107.10
<S> i am luigi vampa , shepherd of the san felice farm . what do you want ? i would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca bianca . follow me , then , said the sentinel ; or , as you know your way , go first . vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit , went before teresa , and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before .: 50.37
<S> merce de s remained , therefore , by his bedside , and m. morrel went away , making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney piece ; but , availing himself of the doctor s order , the old man would not take any sustenance ; at length after nine days of despair and fasting , the old man died , cursing those who had caused his misery , and saying to merce de s , if you ever see my edmond again , tell him i die blessing him . the abbe rose from his chair , made two turns round the chamber , and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat .: 39.24
<S> the clerks gone , mme .: 78.25
<S> oh , you are young while i am beginning to get old .: 49.50
<S> at the centre window , the one hung with white damask with a red cross , was a blue domino , beneath which franz s imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina .: 48.83
<S> why didn t the baron come himself ? demanded buckingham .: 46.03
<S> ah , said morcerf , i see you are a stickler for forms , my dear sir , and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted .: 35.05
<S> this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars , and by sighs launched in the same direction .: 52.45
<S> but listen , porthos : though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised , mazarin is not less strong than he , and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him .: 49.29
<S> five corridors diverged like the rays of a star , and the walls , dug into niches , which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins , showed that they were at last in the catacombs .: 62.68
<S> at the noise he made in pushing the bolt , milady turned round .: 35.63
<S> his costume of guardsman in the company of m. dessessart ought to be his passport .: 47.62
<S> it was on that occasion that my ancestor , enguerrand de la fere , was made a knight of the order of st. michael ; besides which , the king , fifteen years afterward , gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house , also a lovely specimen of workmanship .: 56.98
<S> are you hungry ? continued he .: 16.97
<S> section 2 .: 36.23
<S> sir , said mousqueton , i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country , and i think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest . how !: 50.33
<S> i have only one thing to say to you .: 10.78
<S> god has so willed it ! said he , with the resignation of a fanatic ; but without , however , being able to take his eyes from that ship , on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life .: 41.04
<S> they called upon him then to retire ; but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart , entirely devoted to your majesty , and that therefore he would remain with messieurs the musketeers . brave young man ! murmured the king .: 47.99
<S> the count laid his hand on franz s shoulder .: 18.95
<S> go and tell laporte to wake and dress the king , and then pass on to the marechal de villeroy and summon him to me . bernouin bowed and retired .: 38.32
<S> i shall , therefore , not visit either of these telegraphs , but one in the open country where i shall find a good natured simpleton , who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work . you are a singular man , said villefort .: 44.35
<S> madame de saint me ran has arrived , and her husband is dead ! m. de saint me ran and noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship ; still , the death of one old man always considerably affects another .: 42.39
<S> he entreated to be allowed to walk about , to have fresh air , books , and writing materials .: 89.51
<S> come in , my host . now , then , asked albert eagerly , have you found the desired cart and oxen ? better than that ! replied signor pastrini , with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself .: 43.38
<S> it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening .: 35.50
<S> here are five hundred pistoles , he said ; and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum to morrow . i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship , said planchet , putting the bag under his arm .: 39.00
<S> grimaud begins his functions .: 101.17
<S> as our fugitives approached the house , they found the ground cut up , as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them .: 61.57
<S> i have one thing to reproach myself with , said he , stopping albert on the steps .: 26.25
<S> as for my wife , i must tell you , she lowered herself by marrying me , for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in france .: 24.10
<S> sir , he said , you have made a mistake ; you have given me gold . i know it . the concierge looked upon the count with surprise .: 19.01
<S> i know , father , you are the most honorable man i have ever known . good , my son .: 26.73
<S> no time was to be lost .: 26.05
<S> and as it is three months since you have been here , and though , distracted as you must be in your important occupations , you have forgotten to pay me my rent as , i say , i have not tormented you a single instant , i thought you would appreciate my delicacy . how can it be otherwise , my dear bonacieux ? replied d artagnan ; trust me , i am fully grateful for such unparalleled conduct , and if , as i told you , i can be of any service to you i believe you , monsieur , i believe you ; and as i was about to say , by the word of bonacieux , i have confidence in you . finish , then , what you were about to say . the citizen took a paper from his pocket , and presented it to d artagnan .: 30.79
<S> athos listened to him without a frown ; and when he had finished , said , trifles , only trifles ! that was his favorite word .: 53.14
<S> in fact , it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that i think monsieur de comminges must be mistaken . what ?: 34.61
<S> she crushed the paper in her hand , and turning with flashing eyes upon kitty , she cried , what is this letter ? the answer to madame s , replied kitty , all in a tremble .: 37.61
<S> the cardinal seemed furious .: 40.73
<S> the street was laid out , a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate , but before construction was begun , it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables , by building along the line of the proposed street , and so making it a branch of communication with the faubourg saint honore itself , one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris .: 74.33
<S> drink this , and then take nothing more tonight . valentine stretched out her hand , but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear .: 45.39
<S> the heat of the day had gradually decreased , and a light breeze arose , seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south .: 51.87
<S> but for this precaution , which , it will be remembered , the abbe had made to edmond , the misfortune would have been still greater , for their attempt to escape would have been detected , and they would undoubtedly have been separated .: 44.36
<S> the procureur ? no . the doctor ? yes . you wish to remain alone with m. de villefort ? yes . but can he understand you ? yes . oh , said villefort , inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him alone , oh , be satisfied , i can understand my father . while uttering these words with this expression of joy , his teeth clashed together violently .: 30.08
<S> he has , i repeat , the longest head of the four , and for my part i declare that i will obey him .: 41.41
<S> when i tell you a thing , sir , said mordaunt , you insult me by doubting it . i ! cried d artagnan , i doubt what you say !: 23.67
<S> and the edicts ?: 85.74
<S> all was dark ; one solitary , feeble light was burning in the porter s lodge , about forty paces distant from the house , as baptistin had said .: 56.10
<S> mazarin breathed again .: 65.74
<S> but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this ? since 1811. dante s shuddered ; this man had been four years longer than himself in prison .: 42.17
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> but don t think yourselves in a better position than you are .: 54.94
<S> so , once more , good night . caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold .: 64.32
<S> we have purchased permission to waive the usual delay ; and at half past two o clock the mayor of marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall .: 39.00
<S> then , arousing from his reverie : now , sir , i have one request to make to you , which you will understand , even if it should be disagreeable to you . proceed , said monte cristo .: 24.37
<S> the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking ; and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed monsieur groslow and his companions . sir ! replied mordaunt , in a tone of deep despair , my penitence is sincere .: 67.64
<S> when i informed him that your lordship was the prote ge of monsieur de tre ville , and that you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman , he appeared to be very much disturbed , and asked me where that letter was , and immediately came down into the kitchen , where he knew your doublet was . then that s my thief , replied d artagnan .: 33.83
<S> i will consent to share this dreadful secret with you , but i will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience , as crime and misery will in your house . then you abandon me , doctor ? yes , for i can follow you no farther , and i only stop at the foot of the scaffold .: 43.23
<S> those idiots ! cried porthos , they have not even pursued us .: 41.51
<S> you are right ; it is not you who should apprise m. danglars , it is i. do not do so , reverend sir . why not ? because you would bring us to ruin . and you think that to save such villains as you i will become an abettor of their plot , an accomplice in their crimes ? reverend sir , said caderousse , drawing still nearer .: 45.30
<S> i ?: 34.71
<S> oh , it is impossible you must have saved some surer , more subtle and deadly poison than any other , that you might escape the punishment that you deserve .: 63.74
<S> ho !: 16.63
<S> a dead horse ! said d artagnan , pulling up his horse , which shied ; it seems their horses , too , are breaking down , as well as ours . i seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen , exclaimed porthos , leaning over his horse s mane .: 40.03
<S> i confess it , but pardon to every sin !: 72.42
<S> that man is cromwell , said he .: 16.85
<S> merce de s opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him .: 38.04
<S> already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht .: 31.69
<S> i suspect , said he , a tall , dark man , of lofty carriage , who has the air of a great lord .: 45.44
<S> quite alone ? he asked .: 35.63
<S> yes , yes , said the king , caressing it with his hand , yes , my arthur , thou art a fond and faithful creature . after this little scene charles threw himself into the saddle , and turning to athos , aramis and winter , said : now , gentlemen , i am at your service . but athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp .: 31.46
<S> no , madame ; but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends . and porthos , turning on his heel , made a step to retire .: 70.63
<S> but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them , or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance , of which we have just spoken ?: 70.54
<S> he is master of his arm , yet he strikes without remorse . the executioner ! muttered athos , as if arrested by some recollection .: 66.46
<S> i speak to you in french , said d artagnan ; be kind enough , then , to reply to me in the same language .: 20.34
<S> immediately afterwards the light expired , and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity , while the clock at that minute struck half past four .: 78.60
<S> he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came , and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality .: 61.88
<S> sir , said madame de saint me ran , without using any circumlocution , and as if fearing she had no time to lose , you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child ? yes , madame , replied villefort , it is not only projected but arranged . your intended son in law is named m. franz d e pinay ? yes , madame . is he not the son of general d e pinay who was on our side , and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the island of elba ? the same . does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a jacobin ? our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished , mother , said villefort ; m .: 38.10
<S> if i am killed well then mother , you can also die , and there will be an end of our misfortunes . it is well , replied merce de s , with her eloquent glance ; you are right , my love ; let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of compassion . but let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions , said the young man ; i assure you we are , or rather we shall be , very happy .: 32.63
<S> ah , said beauchamp , you doubt me ?: 18.06
<S> for forty years , he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support .: 34.65
<S> morrel shook his head .: 12.43
<S> that depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire me . then today , madame oh , today , i am no further than gratitude . ah !: 64.06
<S> you are going already ? he said .: 19.11
<S> my children , two of them , at least , the duke of york and the princess elizabeth , are far away from me , exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes ; my husband , the king , is leading in england so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired .: 56.41
<S> bills upon his majesty s private treasury , answered d artagnan , who , reckoning upon entering into the king s service in consequence of this recommendation , believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a falsehood .: 81.80
<S> yes , sir , replied the englishman .: 6.25
<S> athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed .: 45.54
<S> i make a match ?: 92.99
<S> your name ? the baroness danglars ; you have seen me twenty times . possibly , madame .: 37.91
<S> only , to alleviate the tediousness of the duty , athos allowed him to take a loaf , two cutlets , and a bottle of wine .: 36.62
<S> but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to d artagnan , and a well known voice said , monsieur , i have brought your cloak ; it is chilly this evening . planchet ! cried d artagnan , beside himself with joy .: 37.91
<S> the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort , who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes .: 62.68
<S> go on . as i entered ni mes , i literally waded in blood ; at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers , who killed , plundered , and burned .: 110.57
<S> they will be paid , if there is no way of getting out of it . does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day ? by bacchus ! rejoined mazarin , impatiently , it s about an hour since i asked you for that very thing , wooden head that you are . there is one man for whom i can answer , if he will speak out . that s my concern ; i will make him speak . ah , my lord , tis not easy to make people say what they don t wish to let out . pooh !: 47.06
<S> this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose colored satin .: 87.07
<S> make free , now you have begun . no ; you are , after all , a good companion ; i will not detain you , and will try to cure myself of my ambition . but take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold . i shall not sell it do not fear . not at least till the day after tomorrow , thought the young man .: 50.44
<S> let us follow him , said de guiche ; it will be the surest plan . i was about to propose so doing , answered de bragelonne .: 31.31
<S> he still doubts , thought milady ; i have not been earnest enough . someone was heard in the corridor ; milady recognized the step of lord de winter .: 50.41
<S> ten other carriages followed , containing the ladies of honor , the officers of the royal household , and the court .: 55.25
<S> time , which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle , as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness , seemed to have respected these signs , which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity , and probably with a definite purpose .: 89.02
<S> what diabolical villainy you have performed here , said porthos , when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves alone .: 40.16
<S> i am sure you would not have forced me to come .: 19.13
<S> at the lesser gate of the castle ; he s posted there . are you a large party ? sixty . let him know . this moment , sir . and believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself , grimaud set off at full speed ; whilst , enchanted at being all together again , the friends awaited his return .: 80.95
<S> d artagnan , still unperceived , supported himself against the other side .: 26.19
<S> his forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts ; he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul , and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed .: 97.21
<S> volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg s goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg collection will remain freely available for generations to come .: 27.40
<S> and a comforting one , too , added d artagnan , seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man .: 39.10
<S> here comes m. morrel back .: 107.78
<S> now , said monte cristo , turning towards morrel , i may depend upon you , may i not ? certainly , said morrel , i am at your service , count ; still what ? it is desirable i should know the real cause . that is to say , you would rather not ? no . the young man himself is acting blindfolded , and knows not the true cause , which is known only to god and to me ; but i give you my word , morrel , that god , who does know it , will be on our side . enough , said morrel ; who is your second witness ? i know no one in paris , morrel , on whom i could confer that honor besides you and your brother emmanuel .: 37.73
<S> villefort stood watching , breathless , until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy .: 59.67
<S> the general alighted , leaning on the arm of the president , of whose dignity he was not aware , considering him simply as a member of the club ; they went through the alley , mounted a flight of stairs , and entered the assembly room .: 40.64
<S> they have closed up the grating with a board . that is well ; god has made them senseless , said felton .: 78.65
<S> so i will not abandon this bouquet . pardieu , returned franz , laughing , in token of your ingratitude . the jest , however , soon appeared to become earnest ; for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the contadini , the one who had thrown the violets to albert , clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button hole .: 64.64
<S> the man who abducted my wife . the cardinal rang a second time .: 31.21
<S> without reckoning , replied monte cristo , that all his fortune will come to you , and justly too , since mademoiselle danglars is an only daughter .: 34.29
<S> besides , the physician might declare the ailment feigned ; and milady , after having lost the first trick , was not willing to lose the second .: 40.81
<S> in a second i had disinterred the box ; then , that it might not be known i had done so , i filled up the hole , threw the spade over the wall , and rushed through the door , which i double locked , carrying off the key . ah , said monte cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery . no , your excellency , returned bertuccio ; it was a vendetta followed by restitution . and was the sum a large one ? it was not money . ah , i recollect , replied the count ; did you not say something of an infant ? yes , excellency ; i hastened to the river , sat down on the bank , and with my knife forced open the lock of the box .: 35.77
<S> besides , the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me , at least entirely , as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur this or monsieur that .: 78.11
<S> he s not going to hunt , for he has neither dogs nor arms ; he s not going on a message , for he goes secretly .: 70.43
<S> all ! answer , then .: 68.10
<S> oh , morrel , pray love him for all his goodness to us ! morrel swore to love him with all his soul ; and at that moment he could safely promise to do so , for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father , he worshiped him as a god .: 41.82
<S> why , i have as much money as i want ; mother assunta always furnishes me when i ask for it !: 54.46
<S> one day , when he had an appointment with a duchess , he endeavored even to borrow it of athos .: 39.16
<S> i maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name , my social position , and my merit . you are completely mistaken , sir , said monte cristo coldly , who felt the perfidious man uvre of the young man , and understood the bearing of his words ; you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained ; for , after all , who procured for me , who had never seen either you or your illustrious father , the pleasure of your acquaintance ? two of my good friends , lord wilmore and the abbe busoni .: 48.92
<S> oh , said she , seizing the count s hand and raising it to her lips ; oh , thank you , thank you , edmond !: 12.86
<S> clemency is a royal virtue ; employ it , and you will find that you derive advantage therein . thereupon the cardinal , hearing the clock strike eleven , bowed low , asking permission of the king to retire , and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the queen .: 68.49
<S> no , louise , no !: 26.68
<S> grimaud turned round with a jerk , recognized me , and pointed to the man in the mask .: 34.26
<S> and the count pressed her hand in reply , as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to morrel s study .: 34.21
<S> the sick man was not yet able to speak , but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door .: 24.73
<S> do not lie , my angel , said d artagnan , smiling ; that would be useless . what do you mean ?: 14.64
<S> go from hence to blangy , and from blangy to neufcha tel .: 38.74
<S> you , a deputy procureur , to found an accusation on such bad premises !: 135.85
<S> the corsican ogre chapter 12 .: 28.17
<S> now you have done , grimaud , take our brigadier s half pike , tie a napkin to it , and plant it on top of our bastion , that these rebels of rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the king . grimaud obeyed without replying .: 73.26
<S> so , my dear mother , i am going at once to ask franz to lend me the small sum i shall require to supply my present wants . you , my poor child , suffer poverty and hunger ?: 52.64
<S> during dessert , the servant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage .: 58.07
<S> sometimes you pretend i am useful to you , and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing , and i accept it , fernand , because you are the son of my father s brother , because we were brought up together , and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse .: 38.16
<S> immediately ? said albert .: 26.82
<S> but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced .: 37.52
<S> do you know that ?: 9.39
<S> he had observed between the house that madame de longueville inhabited and the convent of the jesuits , an open space surrounded by a hedge .: 47.15
<S> as for that , m. morrel , said he , again turning his quid , as for that as for what ? the money . well well , we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present , and that we will wait for the rest . thanks , my friends , thanks ! cried morrel gratefully ; take it take it ; and if you can find another employer , enter his service ; you are free to do so . these last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman .: 39.82
<S> don t disturb yourself , julie , said he .: 22.89
<S> de saint me ran , madame de saint me ran , m. noirtier how ?: 16.86
<S> here is an order for two hundred pistoles ; call upon my treasurer and get the money .: 41.56
<S> i only wait till you give them . you will go to buckingham in my behalf , and you will tell him i am acquainted with all the preparations he has made ; but that they give me no uneasiness , since at the first step he takes i will ruin the queen . will he believe that your eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made ? yes ; for i have the proofs . i must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation . without doubt .: 45.09
<S> suddenly he heard a cry it was his daughter s voice .: 26.22
<S> the door , as it opened , disclosed a gloomy sky , in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant , only to sink into obscurity .: 51.76
<S> you have asked for me ? said the musketeer .: 13.53
<S> the cold sweat sprang forth on dante s brow .: 20.42
<S> ah , yes , said faria ; the penknife .: 28.59
<S> see , gentlemen , said m. de beaufort , this wonderful animal , not finding here what i ask for , seeks it out of doors ; you shall , however , have his answer .: 61.97
<S> i must die ! then she arose of herself , and cast around her one of those piercing looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame .: 53.00
<S> we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do , replied d artagnan .: 30.13
<S> i had the money with me ; i made the tenant sign the deed of resilition , and when i had obtained what i so much wanted , i galloped to auteuil .: 65.42
<S> edmond , being consulted , was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security , and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly .: 85.20
<S> he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky , across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear ; before him was the vast expanse of waters , sombre and terrible , whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm .: 114.31
<S> marie michon oh , what do i not owe you , aramis ? said d artagnan .: 21.36
<S> you do not know at all , and in this way they will chase him to paris , without drawing a trigger . grenoble and lyons are faithful cities , and will oppose to him an impassable barrier . grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm all lyons will hasten to welcome him .: 86.58
<S> things passed as on the night before .: 90.01
<S> you pretend to pardon me , and you poison me ! i ! cried d artagnan .: 21.19
<S> d artagnan , half stupefied , without his doublet , and with his head bound up in a linen cloth , arose then , and urged by the host , began to descend the stairs ; but on arriving at the kitchen , the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage , drawn by two large norman horses .: 50.49
<S> the count stood alone , and at a sign from his hand , the carriage went on for a short distance .: 19.53
<S> i can answer positively on that point , for the musketeers belong to our forces and monsieur de cambon , the substitute for monsieur d artagnan , still holds his place . the two friends looked at each other .: 30.38
<S> george villiers , duke of buckingham chapter xiii .: 42.98
<S> the girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply .: 51.58
<S> sometimes i amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law .: 105.06
<S> anne s head was bent down she had not seen the italian s smile ; but finding that her question elicited no reply she looked up .: 94.14
<S> the sentinel wanted to repulse him ; but felton called to the officer of the post , and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer , he said , a pressing message from lord de winter . at the name of lord de winter , who was known to be one of his grace s most intimate friends , the officer of the post gave orders to let felton pass , who , besides , wore the uniform of a naval officer .: 40.76
<S> the cardinal envied that composure , which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger ; but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself , that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage .: 127.00
<S> oh , i would rather mount the scaffold of my brother , louis xvi. , than thus descend the staircase at the tuileries driven away by ridicule .: 87.93
<S> d artagnan stood for an instant , mute , pensive and motionless ; then , as he went in , he saw the fair madeleine , his hostess , standing on the threshold .: 21.45
<S> all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses , and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them . is it possible , exclaimed the count with well feigned astonishment , that these horses belong to the baroness ? they do , indeed .: 60.71
<S> what a devil of a face you have , porthos !: 39.07
<S> the king had not yet returned from hunting .: 34.91
<S> the bishop affected to speak in a loud voice , before every one , of their previous interview .: 97.24
<S> it appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence , and that fresh information awaited him .: 30.58
<S> with his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles , while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle spectres such as hoffmann strews over his punch drenched pages , like black , fantastic dust .: 143.90
<S> he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance ; he ventured to call , and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh .: 43.23
<S> the appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter , for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him , effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel .: 61.96
<S> without that , what would become of me ? it was one o clock in the morning .: 17.70
<S> the question of carrying the city by assault , though often debated in the council of the king , had been always rejected .: 78.71
<S> as the rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them , they fired upon him , and he fell , struck by a ball which broke his shoulder .: 50.82
<S> this time it was not a host but a hostess who received him .: 44.91
<S> are not you the person who brought me a letter , inquired franz , from the viscount of morcerf ? your excellency lodges at pastrini s hotel ? i do . your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount ? i am . your excellency s name is the baron franz d e pinay . 20199m then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed . is there any answer ? inquired franz , taking the letter from him .: 39.24
<S> once in service , i shall be rich once in m. dante s house , you will be at rest .: 73.81
<S> you see , my poor friend , that i am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness ; perhaps i am wrong in speaking thus to you , who have evidently a leaning to mazarin . i ! cried d artagnan , not in the least . you spoke of a mission . did i ?: 47.77
<S> what is that ? exclaimed the queen .: 7.42
<S> you must depart instantly , monsieur .: 35.27
<S> it was delightful weather .: 37.93
<S> five or six minutes elapsed .: 15.56
<S> the young man burst into a laugh .: 12.51
<S> it is useless to let the cardinal know . yes , sire . you understand , tre ville an edict is still an edict , it is forbidden to fight , after all . but this encounter , sire , is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel .: 46.11
<S> signor pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent bre guet , bearing the name of its maker , of parisian manufacture , and a count s coronet .: 49.96
<S> signor pastrini interpreted the question and answer , and the horses galloped off .: 62.76
<S> cries were soon heard , and then moans , which someone appeared to be endeavoring to stifle .: 66.03
<S> we will snatch some supper ; we shall perhaps travel part of the night , and must keep our strength up . great god ! said mme .: 74.78
<S> emmanuel , go with them , and see that my orders are executed . at least , we shall see each other again , m. morrel ? asked penelon .: 33.36
<S> come here , grimaud , said athos .: 12.51
<S> private secretary to a minister , plunged at once into european cabals and parisian intrigues ; having kings , and , better still , queens , to protect , parties to unite , elections to direct ; making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than napoleon did of his battle fields with his sword and his victories ; possessing five and twenty thousand francs a year , besides your place ; a horse , for which cha teau renaud offered you four hundred louis , and which you would not part with ; a tailor who never disappoints you ; with the opera , the jockey club , and other diversions , can you not amuse yourself ?: 151.82
<S> m. noirtier , being deprived of voice and motion , is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes , and to wink when he means no . you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m. noirtier ; try . noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself .: 68.31
<S> sir , said she , i perfectly understand my grandfather s meaning at all times . that is quite true , said barrois ; and that is what i told the gentleman as we walked along . permit me , said the notary , turning first to villefort and then to valentine permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself can not proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility .: 49.33
<S> see if he is still in the same place . athos turned around with an effort ; the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him , and there he still was , in fact , on the rock , the beacon shedding around him , as it were , a doubtful aureole .: 37.13
<S> now to the work i have in hand . and after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone , the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed .: 34.28
<S> tell me , he said tell me what you want ? well , then , i want you to take me up in your fine carriage , and carry me back . andrea turned pale , but said nothing .: 24.79
<S> there , on turning round , d artagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared .: 18.07
<S> milady uttered a stifled groan .: 18.89
<S> d artagnan already wore his uniform for being nearly of the same size as aramis , and as aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double , he sold his friend a complete outfit .: 88.49
<S> i could make of that subject two volumes the size of this , continued the jesuit ; and in his enthusiasm he struck a st. chrysostom in folio , which made the table bend beneath its weight .: 81.94
<S> he will never believe that my death was suicide ; and yet it is important for the honor of my memory , and this surely is not vanity , but a justifiable pride , it is important the world should know that i have consented , by my free will , to stop my arm , already raised to strike , and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others i have struck myself .: 63.03
<S> let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing ; that is all i want . oh ! muttered porthos , shaking his head , never should i have thought this of him !: 33.90
<S> no , i shall go incognito , count , under the name of marie michon . you are adorable , madame . but do not keep raoul with you . why not ? because he is in love . he !: 30.29
<S> aramis determined to obtain from the bishop , through fear or by persuasion , consent that he should enter in the bishop s place , and clad in his sacerdotal robes , the prison at whitehall .: 71.73
<S> noble natures never lose courage , nor good stomachs their appetites .: 154.09
<S> valentine had not seen him .: 18.65
<S> besides , said she , the sum you required me to borrow was rather large . madame coquenard , i gave you the preference .: 64.09
<S> he had his foot upon it , that is all ; and i thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was his . and you were deceived , my dear sir , replied aramis , coldly , very little sensible to the reparation .: 53.49
<S> charles also had recognized the four frenchmen .: 81.91
<S> i will be silent , but you must endure your captivity quietly .: 45.22
<S> the road , as d artagnan had observed , was the way to blois .: 23.36
<S> and what is a fronde ? inquired mazarin .: 18.22
<S> there she made a fresh sign of silence , and opened a second door concealed by tapestry .: 46.87
<S> the reader must now cross the seine with us and follow us to the door of the carmelite convent in the rue saint jacques .: 39.72
<S> bonacieux blushed .: 41.75
<S> but what are you about there ?: 17.32
<S> for that reason i wished to see you , to speak to you , to warn you against everyone , but especially against him .: 33.17
<S> for the king ! cried d artagnan .: 9.80
<S> the host stood at the door .: 9.29
<S> this door communicated with a subterranean passage , leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future protector .: 52.46
<S> porthos could hardly keep his countenance .: 35.99
<S> d artagnan and athos took the nags of planchet and grimaud , and the two lackeys started on foot , carrying the saddles on their heads .: 22.18
<S> egad !: 25.42
<S> zounds !: 34.39
<S> i remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money , and but for that diamond , which i was obliged to sell , we should have remained on the road . the devil he does !: 52.62
<S> yes , monseigneur , said d artagnan .: 5.07
<S> i know them , cried milady , who began to feel a chill penetrate her heart .: 27.65
<S> and what may be that description ? dark complexion ; hair , eyebrows , and whiskers black ; blue frock coat , buttoned up to the chin ; rosette of an officer of the legion of honor in his button hole ; a hat with wide brim , and a cane . ah , ha , that s it , is it ? said noirtier ; and why , then , have they not laid hands on him ? because yesterday , or the day before , they lost sight of him at the corner of the rue coq he ron . didn t i say that your police were good for nothing ? yes ; but they may catch him yet . true , said noirtier , looking carelessly around him , true , if this person were not on his guard , as he is ; and he added with a smile , he will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance . at these words he rose , and put off his frock coat and cravat , went towards a table on which lay his son s toilet articles , lathered his face , took a razor , and , with a firm hand , cut off the compromising whiskers .: 44.00
<S> during this time , the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight , and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those which precursors of the storm began to play in at the windows .: 63.97
<S> at present , i confess , that is the thing i stand most in need of . buckingham gave d artagnan a chamber adjoining his own .: 65.08
<S> when the two were ready to go out , the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim , and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon , and prepared to follow his master .: 35.76
<S> porthos , said d artagnan , if you can still speak , say a word , my dear porthos , to this good planchet . planchet , my friend , said porthos , in a melancholy voice , i am very ill ; should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me . oh !: 25.20
<S> this man was our old acquaintance , gaspard caderousse .: 54.43
<S> you have continued your course of villany ; you have robbed you have assassinated . well , i should say !: 68.86
<S> madame de saint me ran chapter 73 .: 12.19
<S> and why in this solemn drawing room when the study is so comfortable ? i quite understand why you ask , sir , said euge nie , making a sign that her father might be seated , and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation .: 47.71
<S> i am lost !: 11.60
<S> at length an honorable peer , morcerf s acknowledged enemy , ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived .: 93.88
<S> the walls were hollowed out in sepulchres , one above the other , and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes , like those which we see on the faces of the dead .: 52.18
<S> flying through an army , sire , said athos , in all countries in the world is called charging . then i shall die , sword in hand , said charles .: 62.89
<S> just as the court was settling down in the cathedral , a carriage , bearing the arms of comminges , quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the rue saint christophe , now entirely deserted .: 46.81
<S> on the left , in a sort of valley , he perceived a circular excavation .: 31.73
<S> the cardinal could not keep up with them , though with every wish to do so .: 40.58
<S> it was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve . i understand , said athos smiling , midnight . about that time . but , my dear fellow , those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off , especially with so good an excuse to give on your return yes , if i return . if you do not return , how does it concern you ?: 68.88
<S> no , no , continued the count , had i to avenge myself , it is not thus i would take revenge . then you disapprove of duelling ?: 32.75
<S> dante s would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor .: 63.47
<S> your majesty , continued the coadjutor , pitilessly , is about to take such measures as seem good to you , but i foresee that they will be violent and such as will still further exasperate the rioters . in that case , you , monsieur le coadjuteur , who have such power over them and are at the same time friendly to us , said the queen , ironically , will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon them . perhaps it will be too late , said gondy , still unmoved ; perhaps i shall have lost all influence ; while by giving up broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the revolt . have i not , then , that right ? cried the queen .: 60.07
<S> true enough ; he wanted to kill me ! returned the turnkey .: 47.34
<S> they began by walking through the apartments , many of which were fitted up in the eastern style , with cushions and divans instead of beds , and pipes instead of furniture .: 69.92
<S> there ! he cried .: 11.91
<S> all we can now do is to wait .: 66.83
<S> as for the two others , i had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that i have forgotten their real ones . oh , mon dieu , it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out , said the queen , since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the king . oh , yes , said de winter , for they are the same men .: 28.45
<S> she then replaced the bonnet , and saw with pleasure , in a little pocket mirror , that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible .: 58.25
<S> mousqueton was , however , somewhat consoled by d artagnan , who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of paris and within reach of the chateau du vallon , which was near corbeil , or bracieux , which was near melun , and of pierrefonds , which was between compiegne and villars cotterets .: 42.43
<S> she is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from it .: 66.05
<S> duke , said flamarens , you forget that to morrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance , projected by the prince , assented to by the queen .: 44.37
<S> but when you held her in your power , why did you not drown her , strangle her , hang her ? said porthos .: 37.67
<S> what i was saying , villefort , was , that the bonapartists had not our sincerity , enthusiasm , or devotion . they had , however , what supplied the place of those fine qualities , replied the young man , and that was fanaticism .: 54.04
<S> good luck to you . the young sailor jumped into the skiff , and sat down in the stern sheets , with the order that he be put ashore at la canebie re .: 55.23
<S> perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening .: 67.45
<S> de cha teau renaud , m. debray , and five or six other choice spirits , whom you do not know , even by name .: 39.13
<S> there was a great deal going on that morning , and many business like persons at the palais ; business like persons pay very little attention to women , and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer .: 79.07
<S> we are no longer in the middle ages ; there is no longer a vehmgericht , or free tribunals ; what do you want to ask these people ?: 38.53
<S> no , monsieur jester , replied d artagnan ; but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends , if we should have the good fortune to find them living . which is a great chance , replied planchet , but we must not despair of the mercy of god . amen ! said d artagnan , getting into his saddle .: 28.55
<S> my cloak stop up the aperture with it . why ? asked blaisois .: 69.62
<S> he wished to see everything .: 17.47
<S> then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly ; a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword .: 78.60
<S> porthos , aramis and d artagnan followed his example .: 17.91
<S> you spoke to me , athos resumed , of porthos ; have you persuaded him to seek his fortune ?: 51.24
<S> bonacieux ; therefore , ask my own secrets , and i will reveal them to you ; but those of others that is quite another thing . very well , said d artagnan , i shall discover them ; as these secrets may have an influence over your life , these secrets must become mine . beware of what you do ! cried the young woman , in a manner so serious as to make d artagnan start in spite of himself .: 38.09
<S> well , ever since then , the infernal project has been ripening in her brain . ah , then , indeed , sir , said the sweet girl , bathed in tears , i see that i am condemned to die ! no , valentine , for i have foreseen all their plots ; no , your enemy is conquered since we know her , and you will live , valentine live to be happy yourself , and to confer happiness upon a noble heart ; but to insure this you must rely on me . command me , sir what am i to do ? you must blindly take what i give you . alas , were it only for my own sake , i should prefer to die ! you must not confide in anyone not even in your father . my father is not engaged in this fearful plot , is he , sir ? asked valentine , clasping her hands .: 48.17
<S> grimaud had , indeed , during twenty two years of service , seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than athos s imminent death was likely to make him uneasy .: 77.81
<S> no ; what i say , replied bonacieux , is only that i may know whether i am delaying you . why that question , my dear host ? asked d artagnan .: 22.89
<S> he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel , but he was well prepared for what might happen .: 47.15
<S> be it so .: 29.69
<S> this noise redoubled when d artagnan , with a company of musketeers , placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church .: 30.17
<S> faith !: 32.97
<S> he invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of september , 1646 .: 33.06
<S> as for peppino , he examined the paper attentively , put it into his pocket , and continued eating his peas .: 28.23
<S> you know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid . i will do better than that , said albert ; my mother is wishing to go to the sea side what day is fixed for your dinner ? saturday . this is tuesday well , tomorrow evening we leave , and the day after we shall be at tre port .: 65.23
<S> he began gathering the grape leaves which screened the sun from the grapes , and won the heart of the gardener .: 76.58
<S> i have doubtless i am dreaming ; tell me , sir , he said to the sergeant , do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out ? only by their passports ; they are three frondists , who are gone to rejoin the duc de longueville . tis strange , said aramis , almost involuntarily ; i fancied that i recognized mazarin himself . the sergeant burst into a fit of laughter .: 34.42
<S> the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince , and so reached the saint denis gate .: 39.27
<S> while he was speaking , albert had heard the report of two or three pistol shots .: 40.82
<S> you are still with us , i presume ? more than ever .: 36.09
<S> the party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved .: 84.98
<S> madame de villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain , and as she constantly bent over her child , it was difficult to read the expression of her face .: 27.62
<S> it was the portrait of a young woman of five or six and twenty , with a dark complexion , and light and lustrous eyes , veiled beneath long lashes .: 27.05
<S> pah !: 62.49
<S> why , thou art posted here by heaven ! no , sir , said the honest servant , it was monsieur aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses . is aramis here ? yes , sir ; he has been here since yesterday . what are you doing ? on the watch what !: 36.27
<S> what , then , to do ?: 15.08
<S> come let us see them . here they are , replied the jeweller , and he counted out upon the table 15,000 francs in gold , and 30,000 francs in bank notes .: 26.14
<S> madame ! exclaimed athos , what were you saying just now about growing old ?: 41.27
<S> poor edmond , he was cruelly deceived ; but it was fortunate that he never knew , or he might have found it more difficult , when on his deathbed , to pardon his enemies .: 42.73
<S> i will not attempt to argue with you , but i blame you . heyday ! cried d artagnan , what matters it to me , after all , if cromwell , who s an englishman , revolts against his king , who is a scotchman ?: 40.16
<S> when i came to myself again , i was stretched in the same place .: 24.73
<S> i have the misfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly . monsieur scarron , do me the honor , said raoul , blushing , to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the company . ah !: 53.00
<S> ; in fact , he could say , these two children of a cruel and persecuting king , who have inherited the vices of their father , which i alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities these two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the english people , whose unhappiness they the children would infallibly have caused . thus was lady macbeth served by her conscience , when she sought to give her son , and not her husband whatever shakespeare may say , a throne .: 98.49
<S> what do you think , d artagnan ? said athos .: 5.71
<S> noirtier closed his eyes .: 13.75
<S> yes , monsieur ; i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years . villefort , impassive as he was , was struck with this coincidence ; and the tremulous voice of dante s , surprised in the midst of his happiness , struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom he also was on the point of being married , and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another .: 39.90
<S> an adventure on the high road .: 41.50
<S> have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused ? the count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers , but which could not disarm his judges .: 31.25
<S> well , he did remain with them ; and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry . he who wounded jussac ! cried the king , he , a boy !: 80.19
<S> penelon , replied julie , go and inform m. emmanuel of this gentleman s visit , and maximilian will conduct him to the salon . then , turning to monte cristo , i hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes , continued she ; and without awaiting any reply , disappeared behind a clump of trees , and escaped to the house by a lateral alley .: 31.37
<S> athos smiled .: 12.79
<S> i will tell it , cried milady , with a feigned exultation , on the day when i shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith . the look of felton revealed to milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single word .: 39.21
<S> he turned ; ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were , facing the street .: 33.11
<S> milady put her charming blond head out at the window , and gave her orders to her maid .: 30.13
<S> certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished andrea less than themselves , for the wily youth , instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force , had maintained a rigid silence .: 112.35
<S> here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were following .: 144.80
<S> a cavalier , charged with an important mission , had come an hour before your arrival , seeking hospitality , at the very moment that the cure , summoned to the bedside of a dying person , left not only his house but the village , for the entire night .: 73.28
<S> but , apropos , you belong to the fronde , do you not ? madame , i serve the king . yes , in your own way . my way is the way of all gentlemen , and i know only one way , answered athos , haughtily .: 30.57
<S> you have taken your revenge for the rue fe rou , and even exceeded it ; you ought to be satisfied . if your majesty is so , said tre ville , we are . oh , yes ; i am , added the king , taking a handful of gold from la chesnaye , and putting it into the hand of d artagnan .: 20.10
<S> whether noirtier understood the young man s indecision , or whether he had not full confidence in his docility , he looked uneasily at him .: 36.18
<S> the hostess , as she entered , saw d artagnan and uttered a little cry , whereupon d artagnan , judging that he had been recognized , rose , ran to her and embraced her tenderly .: 27.04
<S> i also know that her name is valentine , and i have already prayed for her . thank you , sir , said d avrigny ; since you have commenced your sacred office , deign to continue it .: 25.40
<S> but why do you ask ? i will tell you , replied the young girl , for it is but right you should know .: 16.59
<S> i made it , as well as this larger knife , out of an old iron candlestick . the penknife was sharp and keen as a razor ; as for the other knife , it would serve a double purpose , and with it one could cut and thrust .: 96.35
<S> at these balconies are three hundred thousand spectators romans , italians , strangers from all parts of the world , the united aristocracy of birth , wealth , and genius .: 58.90
<S> i m hit in the other side !: 52.06
<S> and then , said madame de villefort , endeavoring by a struggle , and with effort , to get away from her thoughts , however skilfully it is prepared , crime is always crime , and if it avoid human scrutiny , it does not escape the eye of god .: 61.46
<S> de winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow them .: 54.35
<S> when you can find out a woman s age by her face , it is useless to ask it ; when you can not do so , it is indiscreet . is she beautiful ? sixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest , but the most graceful woman in france . this reply reassured the vicomte .: 50.33
<S> listen , d artagnan .: 11.37
<S> i require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne ; and that my lord , after having been present at the christening , should go to proffer his homage to our holy father the pope . that is , you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions , to quit france and be an exile . i wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity , allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends . mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable , and then turned to d artagnan .: 74.17
<S> my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream ; he feels the wound , though he can not recollect when he received it .: 51.86
<S> your honor ! cried planchet , i ve a man behind me . d artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on planchet s horse .: 62.86
<S> she is at the ball , as you know , since she came to say good bye to you in full dress . noirtier again closed his left eye .: 63.74
<S> the next morning danglars awoke late , though he went to bed so early ; he had not slept well for five or six nights , even if he had slept at all .: 51.56
<S> ah , i can understand that .: 15.54
<S> a bottle , perhaps ? a whole bottle ?: 151.67
<S> one might have thought there was in that cellar one of those famished ogres the gigantic heroes of popular legends , into whose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity .: 84.09
<S> without passports , said planchet .: 25.09
<S> that s lucky , said athos , shrugging his shoulders .: 9.98
<S> athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question .: 88.43
<S> but did he know what was meant by the terrible word vendetta ? he knew so well , that from that moment he shut himself in his house , and never went out unattended , seeking me high and low .: 62.68
<S> for the rest , as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days , if porthos were still at the great st. martin , he would call for him on his way .: 38.17
<S> no ? said the notary ; then , perhaps , it is to your son , m. de villefort ? no . the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator .: 31.64
<S> come now , you don t really wish it ? but he is dead ; i am sure of it . he was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged . all right ; if he comes back you will kill him , you are so skillful and so brave . peste !: 42.46
<S> well , you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says , replied athos , shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity .: 21.57
<S> good god ! cried he , laughing , i quite despair of my poor michon ; she will never write like monsieur de voiture . what does you mean by boor michon ? said the swiss , who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came .: 43.30
<S> i confess myself conquered .: 44.69
<S> the king and his escort have gone this way ; we had better take the opposite direction , eh ? athos did not reply ; he reflected .: 51.93
<S> as for the old man , his chest heaved with his panting respiration .: 47.64
<S> gentlemen , said morrel , reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene , i know what i am saying , and you know as well as i do what i am about to say valentine has been assassinated ! villefort hung his head , d avrigny approached nearer , and noirtier said yes with his eyes .: 31.25
<S> they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia , where they intended to take in a cargo , which was to replace what had been discharged .: 75.05
<S> anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one except the prince de conde , who had sent five or six hundred horsemen into the environs of saint germain with orders to bring in any suspicious person who was going away from rueil , in whatsoever direction it might be .: 52.18
<S> instinctively fernand drew back his chair .: 80.07
<S> some day the people will burn that house , as they burned that of the marechal d ancre .: 69.15
<S> i will make planchet brush my boots ; and when he has done , i will , if you like , send him to you to brush your shoes . he left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell , and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate .: 51.81
<S> the king looked towards him .: 13.63
<S> in that case i can give you proofs . no , sir , said d artagnan ; and we place ourselves at your orders . well , gentlemen , resumed mordaunt , we must set out without delay , to day is the last day granted me by the cardinal .: 22.80
<S> he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving , that even the officer was touched , and , although firm in his duty , he kindly said , my worthy friend , let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions .: 78.56
<S> you have there a most charming mistress , viscount , said the count in a perfectly calm tone ; and this costume a ball costume , doubtless becomes her admirably . ah , monsieur , returned albert , i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this .: 67.88
<S> fine vengeance that , on my faith ! a cold sweat broke from d artagnan s brow .: 45.53
<S> someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains .: 42.68
<S> it was worn by my father , a loyal gentleman .: 33.50
<S> jesus dieu ! he cried ; one of them is trembling with fever , having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours , and the other is a knight of malta , as timid as a young girl ; and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors . well , then , said groslow , bring them with you . but really said d artagnan .: 41.30

<S> you are afraid , are you ?: 17.60
<S> in his most simple actions , as well as in his most secret thoughts , i find a relation to my own .: 54.86
<S> albert understood the allusion in a moment , and was about to throw his glove at the count , when morrel seized his hand , while beauchamp and cha teau renaud , fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge , held him back .: 38.78
<S> he asked where their masters were , and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn , and were then settling their bill with the host .: 51.00
<S> pardieu ! cried d artagnan , you could not have arrived in better time ; the dinner can not have had time to get cold !: 44.08
<S> dear benedetto , said he , i think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune , and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst friend . chapter 82 .: 44.92
<S> enter , sir , said he .: 11.03
<S> he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast ; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits , he had at first thought that dante s might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties , who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade .: 71.07
<S> she is the prettiest little creature in the world , with flaxen hair , blue eyes , at once saucy and languishing . but what say you to raoul s fancy ? nothing i laugh at raoul ; but this first desire of the heart is imperious .: 61.41
<S> i am for those who save the state , said bonacieux , emphatically .: 58.80
<S> be , said the letter , on thursday next , at from six to seven o clock in the evening , on the road to chaillot , and look carefully into the carriages that pass ; but if you have any consideration for your own life or that of those who love you , do not speak a single word , do not make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an instant . no signature .: 51.44
<S> leaning against the tree , he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house .: 66.42
<S> my brother , who made you his heir , died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces all over the body .: 54.10
<S> having obtained the light , he hurried upstairs again , and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps .: 92.62
<S> the general , who had almost fainted , revived .: 53.47
<S> valentine , valentine ! he mentally ejaculated ; but his lips uttered no sound , and as though all his strength were centred in that internal emotion , he sighed and closed his eyes .: 43.03
<S> milady smiled with joy .: 17.68
<S> a large wound , extending from the temple to the mouth , was bleeding profusely .: 62.93
<S> i did not like to go to him without first seeing you . why ? because the count is doubtless aware that i accompanied you to the meeting this morning . 40254m it is probable , said albert .: 42.94
<S> he rose to return the salutation .: 41.00
<S> i tell you so , by the faith of de tre ville . how so ? you will be assassinated . and i shall die in the performance of my duty . but your mission will not be accomplished . that is true , replied d artagnan .: 18.43
<S> yes . and who is the man ? i do not know . why did he not bring it to me here ? the messenger did not say . and where is the messenger ? he went away directly he saw me enter the ball room to find you . oh , said the countess to franz , go with all speed poor young man !: 29.04
<S> additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work .: 33.49
<S> i like your manner , raoul , and your politeness has touched me . athos was more delighted than can be told .: 62.13
<S> mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words .: 38.65
<S> he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the banker s family , in which he had been received as a son , and where , besides , his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in mademoiselle danglars .: 44.88
<S> he wished to call out to him but could not utter a word .: 23.58
<S> so now , i breathe again i am happy ! don t be in haste to celebrate a victory , porthos , interposed d artagnan ; never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering .: 74.58
<S> grimaud rose and obeyed .: 27.35
<S> go and tell m. albert that , and he may know what to answer you . oh , no , no , said the general , smiling faintly , i did not come for that purpose ; you are right .: 27.08
<S> m. franz is not expected to return home for a year to come , i am told ; in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us .: 77.67
<S> when they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated , one after the other , as if the earth had opened under their feet .: 39.82
<S> as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him .: 37.87
<S> he knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man ; and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him , he made use of his time in gazing at bazin .: 46.92
<S> on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph . at the door the count was met by the two notaries , who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine , and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit .: 53.86
<S> and of what malady ? it is feared that it may be the smallpox , sir , replied porthos , desirous of taking his turn in the conversation ; and what is serious is that it will certainly spoil his face . the smallpox !: 52.30
<S> he had learned that dante s had been taken to prison , and he had gone to all his friends , and the influential persons of the city ; but the report was already in circulation that dante s was arrested as a bonapartist agent ; and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible , he met with nothing but refusal , and had returned home in despair , declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done .: 45.80
<S> was he awake , or was it but a dream ?: 70.53
<S> we are about to have the honor of charging you , replied aramis , lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other .: 21.80
<S> how d artagnan and porthos earned by selling straw .: 41.45
<S> he knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry , which he pushed aside .: 37.72
<S> d artagnan and planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive ; then , as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant , they sheathed their swords .: 31.76
<S> well , i selected the cartilages of the heads of these fishes , and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which i welcomed the arrival of each wednesday , friday , and saturday , as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens ; for i will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief .: 67.33
<S> then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant , remounted the steps , went into the cathedral , there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray .: 39.49
<S> one day , when he was seven years old , he came to the curate of palestrina , and asked to be taught to read ; it was somewhat difficult , for he could not quit his flock ; but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which , having no other name , was called borgo ; he told luigi that he might meet him on his return , and that then he would give him a lesson , warning him that it would be short , and that he must profit as much as possible by it .: 46.46
<S> yes , much . about how much ? a thousand pistoles , perhaps . what you demand of me is serious , then ? it is indeed . what must be done ? you must go away immediately .: 38.63
<S> i will await you at the corner of the rue du muse e , and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy , i will hasten to rejoin you , and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me ! then , emmanuel ? said the young girl with hesitation , it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation ? yes .: 25.11
<S> i confess , if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince , and if my brother de turenne were reinstated in his command i would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might . you are perfectly right , my lord . you think so ?: 73.92
<S> monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail , and cast a look around .: 45.05
<S> he will come and visit the comte de la fere . d artagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether porthos understood the importance of that visit , but porthos did not even look toward him .: 25.93
<S> he !: 40.49
<S> bravo !: 16.42
<S> i must have time to file through these bars .: 88.65
<S> on this occasion he began his rounds at dante s cell , and on leaving him he went on to faria s dungeon , taking thither breakfast and some linen .: 58.12
<S> never mind that , returned the sailor , i know their vessel . is it a very beautiful vessel ? i would not wish for a better to sail round the world . of what burden is she ? about a hundred tons ; but she is built to stand any weather .: 77.74
<S> he was soon ordered to the presence of the cardinal .: 20.91
<S> in their stead d artagnan thought he perceived in an obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall .: 68.46
<S> but , he added in a despairing tone , perhaps no one will dare to come for it is known that the spaniards are ranging through the country , and i shall die without absolution .: 53.58
<S> why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life , like those ancient romans , who when condemned by nero , their emperor and heir , sat down at a table covered with flowers , and gently glided into death , amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses ? morrel smiled .: 89.50
<S> straw ! they all cried out , straw !: 134.70
<S> dante s reviewed his past life with composure , and , looking forward with terror to his future existence , chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge .: 70.13
<S> living , you would feel shame at my name ; dead , you may raise your head and say , i am the son of him you killed , because , for the first time , he has been compelled to break his word . the young man uttered a groan , but appeared resigned .: 37.25
<S> lord de winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe it .: 28.86
<S> your honor , in the library of the chateau of bracieux there are a lot of books of travels . what then ? amongst them the voyages of jean mocquet in the time of henry iv . well ? in these books , your honor , tis told how hungry voyagers , drifting out to sea , have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with the fattest among them ! cried d artagnan , unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing .: 91.45
<S> we have secured him . yes , said aramis , through an infamous act of treason . porthos pressed his friend s hand and said to him : yes , sir , all is fair in war , stratagem as well as force ; look yonder ! at this instant the squadron , that ought to have protected charles s retreat , was advancing to meet the english regiments .: 57.53
<S> is it possible that god has abandoned his representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably ?: 49.10
<S> come , sir , said he , addressing broussel , silence that woman and follow me . silence me !: 33.69
<S> so long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character .: 34.82
<S> good !: 24.94
<S> my brother in law and myself expected you yesterday and the day before , but in vain .: 39.50
<S> the guards asked permission of la ramee , who gave it to them , but not till the evening , however ; until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone .: 41.22
<S> this event might have three causes : the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochellais , who might not be sorry to kill one of his majesty s guards , because it would be an enemy the less , and this enemy might have a well furnished purse in his pocket .: 40.51
<S> the musketeer met with a superb andalusian horse , black as jet , nostrils of fire , legs clean and elegant , rising six years .: 97.02
<S> on the other side of the house , to match with the library , was the conservatory , ornamented with rare flowers , that bloomed in china jars ; and in the midst of the greenhouse , marvellous alike to sight and smell , was a billiard table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth .: 49.72
<S> the villefort family vault two days after , a considerable crowd was assembled , towards ten o clock in the morning , around the door of m. de villefort s house , and a long file of mourning coaches and private carriages extended along the faubourg saint honore and the rue de la pe pinie re .: 39.91
<S> bazin followed him upon a roan , holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse ; this was d artagnan s mount .: 86.68
<S> how much were your animals worth , porthos ? ah , if poor mousqueton were here he could tell you to a fraction . no matter ; you can tell within ten crowns . why , vulcan and bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles , and putting phoebus at a hundred and fifty , we should be pretty near the amount . there will remain , then , four hundred and fifty pistoles , said d artagnan , contentedly .: 59.74
<S> d artagnan , who , foreseeing such an event , had kept his eye on him , sprang toward him , caught him in his arms , and assisted him to his chamber .: 18.65
<S> on reaching the door , he bowed .: 13.79
<S> d artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance .: 28.49
<S> what jealousy ; to tear such clothes ! he looks like a big bug , said another ; dresses in fine style .: 165.09
<S> his eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed , since then removed , and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the abbe faria had been .: 88.46
<S> but d artagnan again shook his head .: 11.77
<S> yes , madame .: 8.32
<S> at last ! cried d artagnan .: 8.66
<S> but i will tell you .: 14.02
<S> edmond then resolved to try jacopo , and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize money , but jacopo refused it indignantly .: 81.15
<S> it was the same through which , twenty four years ago , he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard ; the houses , today so smiling and animated , were on that night dark , mute , and closed .: 65.21
<S> ah , i understand !: 11.98
<S> at the precise time when madame danglars , dressed in black and concealed in a long veil , was ascending the stairs leading to debray s apartments , notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home , debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend , who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought , as a friend of the family , to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions .: 35.95
<S> what says monsieur the abbe ?: 50.81
<S> but you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men .: 44.19
<S> all eyes were turned towards this man for to all except athos he was unknown .: 110.34
<S> this doctor has a niece , continued aramis .: 28.57
<S> after passing through the porte saint denis , athos looked at raoul s way of riding and observed : take care , raoul !: 60.04
<S> indeed , my dear sir , said monte cristo , you are revoltingly foppish . i foppish ?: 24.05
<S> he can not make me forget what i shall have lost ! thus talking , they traversed the streets , full of people on account of the fete , and arrived opposite the old cathedral , where first mass was going on .: 51.96
<S> milady was only a queen while among queens .: 92.56
<S> athos had been out since six o clock .: 22.41
<S> parbleu ! at rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments , but i presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day . it is not that which deterred me , replied monte cristo ; but as i determined to have a house to myself , i sent on my valet de chambre , and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it . but you have , then , a valet de chambre who knows paris ? said beauchamp .: 37.25
<S> at every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound .: 47.14
<S> i am the chevalier de rochefort , answered the other , the equerry of monsieur le cardinal richelieu , and i have orders to conduct you to his eminence . we are returning to his eminence , monsieur the chevalier , said athos , advancing ; and you will please to accept the word of monsieur d artagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle . i must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp . we will be his guards , monsieur , upon our word as gentlemen ; but likewise , upon our word as gentlemen , added athos , knitting his brow , monsieur d artagnan shall not leave us . the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward , and saw that porthos and aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate ; he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men .: 27.04
<S> felton took advantage of this moment , and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle .: 31.30
<S> in the evening , on his return , franz found a letter from the embassy , informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day .: 20.66
<S> remember !: 42.70
<S> all around him were lying the palikares , writhing in convulsive agonies , while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows .: 84.63
<S> not if it were my own brother ! cried d artagnan , as if carried away by his enthusiasm .: 28.32
<S> but , said andrea , ill temperedly , by my faith , if it was only to breakfast with you , that you disturbed me , i wish the devil had taken you ! my boy , said caderousse sententiously , one can talk while eating .: 51.79
<S> they will all disappear , like the fabrics children build with cards , and which fall , one by one , under the breath of their builder , even if there are two hundred of them .: 64.76
<S> however , amidst all the prisoner s efforts to elude a systematic examination , raoul had recognized his natural accent .: 82.64
<S> if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains , and there would be an end . horrible ! ejaculated the priest .: 26.75
<S> he knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from paris . do you hesitate ? asked mazarin .: 49.01
<S> the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as euge nie used in leaving it ; she ran lightly upstairs , and with an aching heart entered her apartment , contiguous , as we know , to that of euge nie .: 46.66
<S> those who love me , follow me ! and he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop , snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out , with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe : free !: 38.77
<S> that would boom the market ; she will buy heavily , and she will certainly lose when beauchamp announces the following day , in his gazette , the report circulated by some usually well informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at gabrielle s house , is totally without foundation .: 117.34
<S> and what a strange air for a victor ! but you , answered porthos , seem to me agitated . there s a reason !: 64.79
<S> they are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite wine .: 63.43
<S> the host gave them another chamber , and served them with fresh eggs and some water , which athos went himself to draw at the fountain .: 71.88
<S> well , monsieur , said he , you appear to be more stupid than i am , for you forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us two . ah , said the englishman , is it you , my master ?: 19.42
<S> good , quite right ! cried mordaunt , springing off his horse .: 32.53
<S> my head feels actually cold , said porthos .: 60.55
<S> but instead of either of these , he saw nothing but a strange face , sunburnt , and encircled by a beard , with eyes brilliant as carbuncles , and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth , pointed and sharp as the wolf s or jackal s .: 50.04
<S> he could , like the king , touch the greatest of us on the head , and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders .: 57.02
<S> yes , yes , she said softly to valentine , let her leave ; but do you stay . madame de villefort left , and valentine remained alone beside the bed , for the procureur , overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death , had followed his wife .: 40.78
<S> a gascon a match for cupid the evening so impatiently waited for by porthos and by d artagnan at last arrived .: 157.12
<S> come , then , my friend , we will go forward . haven t you something to say to monsieur de flamarens on your own account ? my friend , said athos , i have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary . and how long ago was that ? when i last drew my poniard . ah !: 42.29
<S> he was not the less intoxicated with joy , electrified by love .: 40.69
<S> in italy ? asked the king eagerly .: 22.79
<S> the count was alone with morrel , who remained motionless as a statue .: 16.86
<S> he is at my house . come , come , my friend , interrupted the marquise , do not neglect your duty to linger with us .: 26.15
<S> the traveller , who was going from palestrina to tivoli , had mistaken his way ; the young man directed him ; but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways , and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route , he begged luigi to be his guide .: 53.84
<S> the other sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato ; 4 and he , your excellency , is poor peppino . the fact is , that you have inspired not only the pontifical government , but also the neighboring states , with such extreme fear , that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example . but peppino did not even belong to my band ; he was merely a poor shepherd , whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions . which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes .: 86.06
<S> i must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so , says she , gazing into the glass , which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself .: 48.10
<S> it need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender , it reaches then , quite naturally , the highest exaltation of which it is capable .: 44.92
<S> you abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d ho te of the ho tel des princes , or the cafe de paris .: 63.12
<S> then the noble and severe countenance of athos crossed his mind ; if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required , athos would no more give him his hand athos would renounce him .: 67.86
<S> emmanuel accompanied me , father .: 81.18
<S> alas , sir , i never had any opinions .: 36.14
<S> do you propose entering any horses at either of these races , count ? i shall do whatever they do at paris , madame , if i have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement . are you fond of horses , count ? i have passed a considerable part of my life in the east , madame , and you are doubtless aware that the orientals value only two things the fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women . nay , count , said the baroness , it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first . you see , madame , how rightly i spoke when i said i required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here . at this instant the favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir ; approaching her mistress , she spoke some words in an undertone .: 60.78
<S> i could recite you the whole of thucydides , xenophon , plutarch , titus livius , tacitus , strada , jornandes , dante , montaigne , shakespeare , spinoza , machiavelli , and bossuet .: 138.67
<S> he , no doubt , thought that prisoners who died in the cha teau d if were interred in an ordinary burial ground , and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell , took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse , and awaited the moment of interment . it was a bold step , and one that showed some courage , remarked the englishman .: 56.61
<S> then , continued he , there is a horse for my lackey , and my valise .: 20.21
<S> through or over ; coachman , gallop on . the coachman raised his whip .: 217.77
<S> mazarin , according to his custom , was thinking much and saying little .: 72.40
<S> a barrier had been placed between dante s and his old friend .: 28.23
<S> really , if the house had not belonged to the father in law of the procureur , one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed . villefort , who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him , here took one , and drank it off .: 52.56
<S> as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting .: 59.81
<S> yes , devotion ; for that is , i believe , the phrase for hopeful ambition . and villefort s father extended his hand to the bell rope , to summon the servant whom his son had not called .: 57.94
<S> count , said villefort , we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes .: 40.29
<S> obey that person implicitly .: 209.96
<S> there are no tears in my eyes , nor is there fever in my veins , yet i see you suffer you , maximilian , whom i love as my own son .: 46.53
<S> athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door , amid the red color in which the house was painted .: 44.76
<S> you seem , sir , she remarked , to be making me undergo a course of cross examination . which you answer according to your fancy , replied mazarin .: 56.84
<S> the apparition as the procureur had told madame danglars , valentine was not yet recovered .: 42.15
<S> besides , as m. de tre ville saw the queen almost daily , he might be able to draw from her majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman , whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress .: 40.18
<S> the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which , over a girl of euge nie s character , could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking ; for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union , the mother , to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter , must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection .: 75.63
<S> as she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name .: 61.97
<S> but he did not succeed , and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink , and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened .: 60.35
<S> really ! exclaimed porthos , opening his great wondering eyes .: 38.75
<S> oh , it is not yet fixed ! murmured fernand .: 34.12
<S> pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please ; but never bring him near me , if you would not see me die of terror .: 66.97
<S> oh , by the way , you d better take lodging in the rue montorgueil at the chat qui pelote .: 108.18
<S> to day the third will be there also . as long as they are in prison all will be well , said anne , but one of these days they will get out . yes , if your majesty releases them . ah ! exclaimed anne , following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions , one regrets paris ! why so ? on account of the bastile , sir , which is so strong and so secure . madame , these conferences will bring us peace ; when we have peace we shall regain paris ; with paris , the bastile , and our four bullies shall rot therein . anne frowned slightly when mazarin , in taking leave , kissed her hand .: 73.41
<S> every article of dress hat , coat , gloves , and boots was from the first makers .: 88.81
<S> here they found only one inn , in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town .: 124.13
<S> yes , she of whom you told me one day at amiens . athos uttered a groan , and let his head sink on his hands .: 22.04
<S> the cardinal there awaited louis xiii .: 84.22
<S> de villefort ! what do you mean ? i mean that m. de nargonne , your first husband , being neither a philosopher nor a banker , or perhaps being both , and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a king s attorney , died of grief or anger at finding , after an absence of nine months , that you had been enceinte six .: 57.02
<S> in the court of the old chateau of saint germain he entered his coach , and reached the seine at chatou .: 41.57
<S> albert de morcerf , said beauchamp , rising in his turn , i can not throw you out of window for three weeks that is to say , for twenty four days to come nor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed .: 43.91
<S> people are found every day in the seine , having thrown themselves in , or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim . father , you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair , and people do not bathe in the seine in the month of january .: 72.95
<S> you will need it this evening , perhaps ; you will certainly need it to morrow . raoul didn t wait to be told twice ; he knew that with superiors , especially when those superiors are princes , the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument ; he went down to the stables , picked out a pie bald andalusian horse , saddled and bridled it himself , for athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger , and went to rejoin the prince , who at that moment mounted his horse .: 77.79
<S> on the contrary , stay , monsieur d artagnan ; your agreeable company will divert me . oh , oh ! thought d artagnan .: 24.61
<S> mazarin ! replied d artagnan , bursting into a laugh .: 19.14
<S> it was mousqueton .: 20.94
<S> who are you ? cried selim .: 17.98
<S> and when i have signed , he said , what is to be my guarantee ? my word of honor , sir , said athos .: 22.98
<S> pray speak of it , for i shall not only , i trust , relate the little i do know , but also a great deal i do not know . it seems to me , returned the count , smiling , that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened . 20249m well , you promise me , if i tell all i know , to relate , in your turn , all that i do not know ? that is but fair , replied monte cristo .: 35.82
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> yes . and her husband found out that she had a fleur de lis on her shoulder ? cried porthos .: 35.33
<S> no ; you are at your journey s end . how , monsieur !: 29.54
<S> well , now , my dear ge rard , said he to the young man , with a very significant look , do you know , you seem as if you were not very glad to see me ? my dear father , said villefort , i am , on the contrary , delighted ; but i so little expected your visit , that it has somewhat overcome me . but , my dear fellow , replied m. noirtier , seating himself , i might say the same thing to you , when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of february , and on the 3rd of march you turn up here in paris . and if i have come , my dear father , said ge rard , drawing closer to m. noirtier , do not complain , for it is for you that i came , and my journey will be your salvation . ah , indeed ! said m. noirtier , stretching himself out at his ease in the chair .: 28.12
<S> they halted for the king to dine .: 51.13
<S> this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth , and deep in the centre , to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class , which would be perfectly concealed from observation .: 51.70
<S> oh , sir , in pity send for a physician ; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy . with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand , monte cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions ; then , opening a casket that stood near , he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold , containing a liquid of the color of blood , of which he let fall a single drop on the child s lips .: 50.95
<S> to fight , that was to disobey the law , that was to risk his head , that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself .: 60.20
<S> never fear quarrels , but seek adventures .: 159.71
<S> my friend , aramis , here , has received a slight sword wound in the arm , but not enough to prevent him , as your eminence may see , from mounting to the assault tomorrow , if your eminence orders an escalade . but you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus , said the cardinal .: 75.11
<S> toward paris . who stopped him ? two young gentlemen , who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom i heard his companion mention the viscount de bragelonne . and it was this young man who brought the monk to you ?: 45.91
<S> in addition to the sword , there was a portrait representing a nobleman of the time of henry iii. , dressed with the greatest elegance , and who wore the order of the holy ghost ; and this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with athos , certain family likenesses which indicated that this great noble , a knight of the order of the king , was his ancestor .: 64.96
<S> now , is that all ? i believe so . let us see : buckingham dead or grievously wounded ; your conversation with the cardinal overheard by the four musketeers ; lord de winter warned of your arrival at portsmouth ; d artagnan and athos to the bastille ; aramis the lover of madame de chevreuse ; porthos an ass ; madame bonacieux found again ; to send you the chaise as soon as possible ; to place my lackey at your disposal ; to make you out a victim of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion ; armentie res , on the banks of the lys .: 64.31
<S> grimaud made a sign that he was not .: 14.18
<S> alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen , my horse sprang into the water .: 60.54
<S> the words that parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was assigned to its real motive .: 72.61
<S> after the ladies had departed for the ball , whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them , the procureur had shut himself up in his study , according to his custom , with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else , but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires .: 65.94
<S> d artagnan obeyed like a child , without the least resistance or objection , which proved that he was really in love .: 27.95
<S> when in a house , of whatever kind it may be , an individual suspected of any crime is arrested , the arrest is held secret .: 122.80
<S> i recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor barrois as well as in that of madame de saint me ran .: 27.59
<S> by degrees the passage narrowed , yet the duke continued his course .: 80.62
<S> porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game , and athos was watching them with so much attention , that they did not even perceive their young companion go out , who , as he had told the guardsman of his eminence , stopped outside the door .: 28.52
<S> fernand was a spaniard , and being sent to spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow countrymen , found danglars there , got on very intimate terms with him , won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces , received promises and made pledges on his own part , guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists , and , in fact , rendered such services in this brief campaign that , after the taking of trocadero , he was made colonel , and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the legion of honor . destiny !: 89.84
<S> then , turning toward porthos , the devil ! said he , this has a bad look .: 22.93
<S> but this i know , that i had a mother , that five men leagued against one woman , murdered her clandestinely by night silently like cowards .: 109.44
<S> ah , i had eighty louis before me ; put down the same sum , so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of .: 71.67
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> then he said aloud : you met him , i dare say , in the park hunting , perhaps ? no ; nearer , nearer still .: 75.35
<S> put back that weapon , d artagnan ! said he ; this woman must be tried , not assassinated .: 50.87
<S> did he take baptistin with him ? no , my lord . call him , then ; i wish to speak to him . the concierge went to seek the valet de chambre , and returned with him in an instant .: 17.89
<S> not a step further , said the man , who appeared to be the captain , or i will hamstring your horses . peste ! said porthos , it would be a pity ; animals which cost me a hundred pistoles each . i will pay you two hundred for them , said mazarin .: 28.92
<S> monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence ? prudence , monsieur , is a virtue sufficiently useless to musketeers , i know , but indispensable to churchmen ; and as i am only a musketeer provisionally , i hold it good to be prudent .: 90.82
<S> did you ever see that man before ? he came twice to milady s. that s it .: 70.44
<S> be content ; i will depart . but you will not follow me ; you will not watch me ? i will return home instantly . ah , i was quite sure you were a good and brave young man , said mme .: 25.41
<S> i neglected it , and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me constance disappeared .: 75.20

<S> in truth , said porthos , i understand ; but now about the middle of the rue des petits champs they were stopped by a second patrol .: 27.04
<S> fourteen years ! he muttered .: 29.76
<S> certainly , continued danglars , the sacrifice was no trifling one , when the beauty of the bride is concerned .: 44.23
<S> the guests in the house in the rue du helder , where albert had invited the count of monte cristo , everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of may to do honor to the occasion .: 32.80
<S> i suppose the count has the tastes of the day ? to be sure , returned monte cristo ; it is very convenient , then ? it is more it is magnificent . peste ! let us not lose such an opportunity , returned monte cristo .: 24.82
<S> the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty five years ; but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time .: 77.82
<S> and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal ! one of your boarders ? said milady ; oh , my god !: 41.55
<S> full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape .: 72.58
<S> one of its chiefs , who understood provenc al , begged the commune of marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory , where , like the sailors of old , they had run their boats ashore .: 96.91
<S> the three listeners looked at one another in alarm .: 35.98

<S> monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy , but aristocracy can not survive without the countenance of monarchs .: 47.05
<S> he again ! cried porthos , who was breathing like a blacksmith s bellows ; why , he is made of iron . oh , my god ! muttered athos .: 33.75
<S> so , then , the rabbit dies , and justice takes no notice .: 40.57
<S> how ! said bonacieux , astonished .: 21.50
<S> was this love a simple political affair , or was it naturally one of those profound passions which anne of austria inspired in those who approached her ?: 78.12
<S> having staggered as far as the rue dauphine , he perceived his carriage , awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself , threw himself on the cushions , and pointed towards the faubourg saint honore ; the carriage drove on .: 54.03
<S> an effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through .: 155.45
<S> courage !: 29.40
<S> but , said franz , in his turn interrupting his host s meditations , you had some motive for coming here , may i beg to know what it was ? 20099m ah , yes ; you have ordered your carriage at eight o clock precisely ? i have . you intend visiting il colosseo . you mean the colosseum ? it is the same thing .: 41.25

<S> franz found himself in utter darkness .: 24.87
<S> let me at least reach a shady spot , said andrea .: 39.06

<S> you are quite upset !: 42.50
<S> when they arrived at the madeleine : since we are out , said beauchamp , let us call on m. de monte cristo ; he is admirably adapted to revive one s spirits , because he never interrogates , and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters . gladly , said albert ; let us call i love him . chapter 85 .: 54.82
<S> this was the abbe scarron , always laughing , joking , complimenting yet suffering and toying nervously with a small switch .: 199.28

<S> the waking chapter 33 .: 31.85

<S> he inquired after the count with his usual familiarity , and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the stairs .: 30.48
<S> no , i do not dance , but i like to see others do so .: 32.15
<S> execution it was near midnight ; the moon , lessened by its decline , and reddened by the last traces of the storm , arose behind the little town of armentie res , which showed against its pale light the dark outline of its houses , and the skeleton of its high belfry .: 48.86
<S> i ask you what year is it ? the year 1829 , returned jacopo .: 67.84

<S> milady saw the trouble .: 55.60
<S> grimaud was so breathless , so exhausted , that he had fallen back upon a chair .: 34.17

<S> he is an upstart , a man of no name , who will only be the tool of a party in france .: 29.44
<S> anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward s extraordinary repugnance for the count s projected drive without the walls ; but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little journey .: 106.36
<S> what you tell me is horrible , sir .: 44.63
<S> if he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him , i would have presented the letter to him with one hand , and with the other i would have run my sword through his body . i expected as much , said athos ; and that was why i threw myself between you and him .: 32.79

<S> bazin looked down and started , as if he had seen a serpent .: 23.73
<S> i i was where d artagnan stands .: 66.14
<S> cucumetto seemed to yield to his friend s entreaties , and bade him find a shepherd to send to rita s father at frosinone .: 44.23

<S> during this time , dante s , at the opposite side of the table , had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests .: 28.82
<S> albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres , with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see , and the absence of balconies , or open boxes ; all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes , and had shared a lower box at the opera .: 69.47
<S> there , said caderousse ; and now , although you have wronged us of perhaps 10,000 francs , will you have your supper with us ?: 35.05
<S> one funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis .: 132.40
<S> he is preparing a way for your majesty to escape .: 51.49
<S> porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to parry s brother , he was not nearly so strong as himself .: 53.43
<S> but , we must say , at the present moment d artagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested .: 38.55
<S> don t be distressed ; you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind .: 37.56
<S> you have mistaken the time , you should have told me this two months ago , it is too late now .: 35.24
<S> it was the fever that disturbed you , madame , said villefort .: 26.47
<S> but on our return , he said aloud , may we , that is , my friend and i , depend on having , he his barony , and i my promotion ? on the honor of mazarin . i should like another sort of oath better , said d artagnan to himself ; then aloud , may i not offer my duty to her majesty the queen ? her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly , replied mazarin ; go , pray , sir one word more , my lord ; if there s any fighting where i m going , must i fight ? you are to obey the commands of the personage to whom i have addressed the inclosed letter . tis well , said d artagnan , holding out his hand to receive the money .: 46.06
<S> by an incredible effort of will i even raised myself up , but only to sink down again immediately , and to fall into the arms of my persecutor . tell me who this man was ! cried the young officer .: 46.64

<S> vicomte , said athos to raoul , follow the duchess ; beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs , and thank her as you descend . the fair indian approached scarron .: 63.85

<S> ah , to be sure , cried porthos , there is a diamond .: 14.70
<S> you will take your place in the coupe to cha lons .: 27.79
<S> no ; but my mother , as a child , saw her .: 26.37
<S> this is , indeed , the reason why i begged you to alter the order of the questions . the public astonishment had reached its height .: 41.15
<S> what ! said he , does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated ? no , returned the count .: 25.63
<S> my clerks are honest men , who earn my fortune , whom i pay much below their deserts , if i may value them according to what they bring in ; therefore i shall not get into a passion with them ; those with whom i will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners , mount my horses , and exhaust my fortune . and pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune ?: 81.46
<S> he has received visits from the coadjutor , from madame de longueville , and the prince de conti ; madame de chevreuse and madame de vendome have left their names at his door .: 22.02

<S> but i will answer for these two words being delivered to their address . oh , my god !: 24.40
<S> just then the lamp again flickered ; the noise startled madame de villefort , who shuddered and dropped the curtain .: 51.98
<S> i faith , aramis , believe me , there is little left to regret .: 55.42
<S> then , internally , if rene e could see me , i hope she would be satisfied , and would no longer call me a decapitator . well , when we quitted naples , captain leclere was attacked with a brain fever .: 56.85
<S> i knew nothing of this engagement , of this love , yet i , her father , forgive you , for i see that your grief is real and deep ; and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart .: 46.98
<S> what good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my heart ? only to make a woman of thirty nine look like a woman of fifty .: 75.48
<S> the two serving men waited without ; but as if they likewise mistrusted each other , they kept their respective distances .: 46.34
<S> then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him , and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed , he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes , which he tried many times to close , but in vain they opened again as soon as shut .: 72.24
<S> stay where you are , i will tell you . mme .: 22.42
<S> he must be the shah of persia , travelling incog . have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman , m. lucien ? inquired euge nie .: 42.54

<S> d artagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse , in order that he might see without being seen .: 16.82

<S> listen to me !: 18.92

<S> now all that is settled , do let me see the performance , and tell your friend albert not to come any more this evening ; he will hurt himself with all his ill chosen barbarisms : let him go home and go to sleep . beauchamp left the box , perfectly amazed .: 71.86

<S> millionaires like yourself , my lord , are rare in france . alas ! said de winter , i am at this moment as poor as he is , if not poorer .: 28.43
<S> soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death , and death then terrified me , and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god .: 61.83
<S> the heights of pindus towered above us ; the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake , and the immense masses of black vegetation which , viewed in the distance , gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks , were in reality gigantic fir trees and myrtles .: 69.62
<S> he struck his forehead on the ground and groaned .: 22.79
<S> the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn .: 88.20
<S> the fate of our friends , to say nothing of our own , is perhaps in that very despatch . this young man must not , however , fail in his duty , said athos .: 43.88
<S> at last , after renewed hesitation , dante s entered the second grotto .: 32.23
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> m. d artagnan , it is for you to accuse her first . d artagnan advanced .: 25.36
<S> d artagnan remained for a moment motionless , asking himself where he could be ; but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber , together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture , the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined , and the word majesty several times repeated , indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen s apartment .: 64.19
<S> ah , let him say now if he does not recognize me ! each word fell like a dagger on morcerf , and deprived him of a portion of his energy ; as she uttered the last , he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom , and fell back on his seat , overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair .: 44.09
<S> a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer , far less calm .: 70.44
<S> i am obliged to you guitant , although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me , for such an opportunity . he turned away and went off to his post , whistling a tune then popular among the party called the fronde , whilst mazarin returned , in a pensive mood , toward the palais royal .: 72.82
<S> the next day , monday , was the first sitting of the assizes .: 26.74
<S> the hour of the banquet being come , the two guards arrived , took their places , and the dishes were arranged on the table .: 34.20
<S> or have you forgotten them ? almost . what has become of them ? i don t know ; we separated , as you know .: 25.60
<S> endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel , in spite of monsieur de richelieu , tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood , to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham . anne arose , full of majesty , and as if touched by a spring , and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful : you are insulting me ! she said .: 61.65
<S> vampa took this wild road , which , enclosed between two ridges , and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines , seemed , but for the difficulties of its descent , that path to avernus of which virgil speaks .: 87.25
<S> the countess was present at the races in the champ de mars , said cha teau renaud .: 20.18
<S> a deathlike silence oppressed all nature .: 149.96
<S> no more edicts , no more of the cardinal s guards , no more de jussacs , nor other bloodhounds .: 90.74
<S> gad ! replied d artagnan ; he has already given me good information and he may do the same again . whilst all this was going on , athos and aramis were entering paris by the faubourg st. antoine .: 27.22
<S> one of them passed around to the right of the carriage , the other to the left .: 17.74
<S> how long will this fuse burn ? asked this person .: 71.43
<S> d artagnan , freely applying his spurs , was in advance of porthos two feet at the most ; mousqueton followed two lengths behind ; the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts .: 83.02
<S> at the same time through the streets of grenelle , saint honore , and du coq , a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of porthos s horse and that of d artagnan .: 52.61
<S> fernand s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to danglars .: 44.27
<S> did you drink some too , m. noirtier ? yes . and did you also discover a bitter taste ? yes . oh , doctor , cried barrois , the fit is coming on again .: 48.27
<S> himself and the two young men represented the body of the army , whilst olivain , with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch , protected the rear .: 36.20
<S> between six and seven o clock the road of chaillot is quite deserted ; you might as well go and ride in the forest of bondy . but suppose we all go , said d artagnan ; what the devil !: 44.55
<S> he paraded his musketeers before the cardinal armand duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his eminence curl with ire .: 115.94
<S> d artagnan remembered having seen this ring on the finger of milady ; it was a magnificent sapphire , encircled with brilliants .: 38.66
<S> the dishes were of silver , and the plates of japanese china .: 42.45
<S> well , i call you , and say to you : friend felton , john , my child , guard me , and more particularly guard yourself , against this woman .: 48.62
<S> let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the comte de la fere , said d artagnan ; for the count must be furious . comminges began to laugh .: 19.60
<S> monsieur man in a hurry , you can find me without running me , you understand ? and where , i pray you ? near the carmes deschaux . at what hour ? about noon . about noon ?: 51.65
<S> if you die , i will die with you ; that is all i can say to you . silence ! cried felton ; we are here . in fact , they touched the sloop .: 19.52
<S> by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp , of which we have spoken , dante s saw the old man , pale , but yet erect , clinging to the bedstead .: 38.57
<S> thanks , murmured the invalid , extending one hand .: 35.08
<S> but i also kept my word with him , and i neither ate nor drank .: 24.60
<S> you are not wrong after all , and life is sweet .: 49.96
<S> how is there still time ? asked the man in the cloak .: 16.45
<S> by the female side , i believe ? said the procurator , maliciously .: 40.28
<S> i broke my word , it is true ; but what signifies that ?: 24.42
<S> four men carried me from paris to cha lons , walking six leagues a day ; madame de villefort followed the litter in her carriage .: 40.60
<S> in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions he had already devoured those of the previous day ; he ate these listening anxiously for the sound , walking round and round his cell , shaking the iron bars of the loophole , restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise , and so preparing himself for his future destiny .: 75.22
<S> cries of down with mazarin ! death to the cardinal ! resounded on all sides .: 98.97
<S> the carmelite convent at be thune great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes them surmount all obstacles , which makes them escape all dangers , up to the moment which a wearied providence has marked as the rock of their impious fortunes .: 150.86
<S> it has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear .: 80.61
<S> the knife fell to the ground .: 19.69
<S> but speak ; i will listen . you recollect that sad night , when you were half expiring on that bed in the red damask room , while i , scarcely less agitated than you , awaited your delivery .: 88.16
<S> then the duke put to pistache this difficult question , who was the greatest thief in the world ?: 56.84
<S> it is not to be called amiability , it is her duty ; a slave does not dictate to a master . come ; you are joking yourself now .: 56.71
<S> the queen entered her oratory , which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian crystal , she saw d artagnan , who stood expecting her .: 28.15
<S> my dear cousin , i think i shall make up my mind to set out for be thune , where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent of the carmelites ; this poor child is quite resigned , as she knows she can not live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in danger .: 43.30
<S> let them take my fortune , i am already too rich ; and , perhaps , when they have taken it , they will leave me in peace and quietness .: 39.62
<S> the bills were renewed , the old ones destroyed , and the poor ship owner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources .: 85.22
<S> there is the subject simplified .: 42.91
<S> as soon as you feel able to swim we will go . i shall never swim again , replied faria .: 53.52
<S> i have not been in bed for two nights ; but then look at my desk ; see what i have written during these two days and nights .: 50.03
<S> left alone , she arose .: 47.07
<S> yes , returned d artagnan , who had overheard him , to night , gentlemen , we rescue the king . d artagnan , said athos , this is no joke , i trust ?: 26.65
<S> that is my condemnation , thought d artagnan ; he will spare me the ennui of the bastille , or the tediousness of a trial .: 29.42
<S> charles smiled .: 35.56
<S> thence , introduced into a half subterranean gallery , he became , on the part of those who had brought him , the object of the grossest insults and the harshest treatment .: 64.08
<S> by no means ; it really seems to me very curious . yes , indeed .: 34.86
<S> in the examination which precedes ordination , a thesis is always a requisite . ordination ! cried d artagnan , who could not believe what the hostess and bazin had successively told him ; and he gazed , half stupefied , upon the three persons before him .: 62.82
<S> the yard was empty ; the clock was striking twelve .: 38.73
<S> morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot , but it had fallen down and the grave digger had burnt it , as he did all the old wood in the churchyard .: 56.51
<S> the next morning , when kitty presented herself at d artagnan s , she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days ; but on the contrary sad as death .: 48.68
<S> edmond opened his eyes , complained of great pain in his knee , a feeling of heaviness in his head , and severe pains in his loins .: 48.27
<S> as a reply , he wrote the following letter : do not depend upon me , madame , for the next meeting .: 35.33
<S> at this sight alone franz felt his legs tremble under him .: 45.63
<S> the boat that now arrived , assured by the answering signal that all was well , soon came in sight , white and silent as a phantom , and cast anchor within a cable s length of shore .: 115.65
<S> we chased him for six hours , and when he was near being taken when st. simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound the halali crack , all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after a two year older .: 120.35
<S> it was a lovely starlight night they had just reached the top of the hill villejuif , from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into light waves indeed more noisy , more passionate , more changeable , more furious , more greedy , than those of the tempestuous ocean , waves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes do , waves ever dashing , ever foaming , ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp .: 204.17
<S> the point of the sword had touched a rib , and glanced along the bone .: 40.08
<S> through the gate was seen kitchen gardens , carefully attended to , a spacious courtyard , in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries , and a carriage , drawn by two horses of the country .: 96.46
<S> our purveyor ! yes , your purveyor , godeau the purveyor of the musketeers . my faith !: 38.86
<S> he was her grandfather on the mother s side .: 31.08
<S> the cardinal was left free to carry on the siege , without having , at least at the present , anything to fear on the part of the english .: 39.88
<S> sacrebleu !: 55.32
<S> on the other bank , replied the executioner .: 16.50
<S> athos had not failed to send early to aramis and had given his letter to blaisois , the only serving man whom he had left .: 43.94
<S> live , maximilian , and i will be yours .: 26.38
<S> tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny , morrel , to pray sometimes for a man , who , like satan , thought himself for an instant equal to god , but who now acknowledges with christian humility that god alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom .: 103.25
<S> at length he raised his head , fixed his eagle look upon that loyal , open , and intelligent countenance , read upon that face , furrowed with tears , all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month , and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twenty one years before him , and what resources his activity , his courage , and his shrewdness might offer to a good master .: 86.71
<S> ere long the door opened and the marechal entered , followed by the coadjutor .: 42.77
<S> let no trace of emotion be visible on your countenance , bear your grief as the cloud bears within it ruin and death a fatal secret , known only when the storm bursts .: 201.00
<S> he filled two glasses , and by a sign invited d artagnan to drink .: 31.59
<S> besides , by the faith of bonacieux you call yourself bonacieux ? interrupted d artagnan .: 53.10
<S> i am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me . how did the viscount albert fall into luigi s hands ? excellency , the frenchman s carriage passed several times the one in which was teresa . the chief s mistress ? yes .: 75.96
<S> athos began to despair .: 29.76
<S> yes , honest i can certainly say that much for myself , continued the innkeeper , fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbe s gaze ; i can boast with truth of being an honest man ; and , continued he significantly , with a hand on his breast and shaking his head , that is more than everyone can say nowadays . 0327m so much the better for you , if what you assert be true , said the abbe ; for i am firmly persuaded that , sooner or later , the good will be rewarded , and the wicked punished . such words as those belong to your profession , answered caderousse , and you do well to repeat them ; but , added he , with a bitter expression of countenance , one is free to believe them or not , as one pleases . you are wrong to speak thus , said the abbe ; and perhaps i may , in my own person , be able to prove to you how completely you are in error . what mean you ? inquired caderousse with a look of surprise .: 51.14
<S> and what does it concern , then my captivity ? i heard of it the day it happened ; but as you were not guilty of any crime , as you were not guilty of any intrigue , as you , in short , knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else , i attached no more importance to that event than it merited . you speak very much at your ease , madame , said bonacieux , hurt at the little interest his wife showed in him .: 53.05
<S> morrel , i thank you in the name of my father and of merce de s. that s all right , edmond .: 24.86
<S> it was quite dark , and no one saw them go out .: 24.67
<S> well , as he means to enter the church at the same time as myself , he does not despair of becoming pope in his turn , or at least a cardinal .: 35.61
<S> friend , the cardinal , although such a genius , could never have done that . shall i take out any more of them ? asked porthos .: 39.16
<S> the captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again , but controlling himself he answered : port wine . ah !: 70.86
<S> the son of a shipowner . really , you should relate all this aloud , you would have the greatest success . he served in india , discovered a mine in thessaly , and comes to paris to establish a mineral water cure at auteuil . well , i m sure , said morcerf , this is indeed news !: 56.91
<S> he appeared to foresee all , to divine all , to anticipate all .: 71.37
<S> he has a free will , yet he fearlessly condemns .: 154.46
<S> felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness ; then , seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged , he went out .: 33.72
<S> what ? said villefort , do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will ? no . sir , said the notary , whose interest had been greatly excited , and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene , what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago , has now become quite easy and practicable , and this may be a perfectly valid will , provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses , approved by the testator , and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses .: 52.32
<S> no ; and yet your father , a man accustomed to judicial accusations , ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally ; it is he who should have watched over you he should have occupied my place he should have emptied that glass he should have risen against the assassin .: 74.98
<S> contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below .: 29.49
<S> then he took the boy upon his knee .: 32.83
<S> may i not drink to your health , and you to mine ? said d artagnan , filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m. bonacieux .: 45.85
<S> i suppose you have no more money and that they will be welcome . i have still twenty pistoles , sir . well , take them ; that makes seventy . and if you wish for more , said porthos , putting his hand to his pocket thank you , sir , replied raoul , blushing ; thank you a thousand times . at this moment olivain appeared .: 28.23
<S> we will do the same . the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold , face to face with d artagnan .: 24.55
<S> my dear raoul , learn , once for all , that that is a question which is never asked .: 50.49
<S> you have doubtless heard of these massacres , your excellency ? vaguely ; i was far from france at that period .: 61.37
<S> a hoarse , broken tone , which was neither a cry nor a sigh , escaped from her , while she became deadly pale .: 45.42
<S> let us visit this one first , added he .: 30.69
<S> albert rubbed his eyes , ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smoking room on the ground floor , dressed himself quickly , and went down .: 34.15
<S> order it as you please , sire ; you possess the right of pardon . the right of pardoning only applies to the guilty , said tre ville , who was determined to have the last word , and my musketeer is innocent .: 46.95
<S> i desire to know what is the meaning of this ? be kind enough , madame , to listen to me , said danglars .: 20.01
<S> dante s was on the way he desired to follow , and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve ; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom .: 41.04
<S> that will do me great honor , said the leader of the posse , and i accept thankfully . then to yours , monsieur what is your name ? boisrenard . monsieur boisrenard . to yours , my gentlemen !: 49.44
<S> oh , oh ! said m. de tre ville .: 7.50
<S> every one withdrew .: 44.93
<S> noirtier s eye was fixed on the dictionary .: 14.62
<S> he had stanched the wound and the man was better .: 40.01
<S> albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner .: 80.10
<S> you would be the happier for it at home , sire , and i do not doubt you would be the greater for it abroad . monsieur duke , said the king , i understand you .: 28.33
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> in that way i discovered that the charming traveler was marie michon ! said madame de chevreuse , hastily .: 45.17
<S> on whom does my bleeding heart repose ?: 174.98
<S> this idea was one of vengeance to me , and i tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity .: 33.76
<S> less quickly than the women , it seems to me , replied porthos ; for i , madame , i may say i was your victim , when wounded , dying , i was abandoned by the surgeons .: 39.76
<S> during the six years that he had been imprisoned , what might he not have accomplished ?: 46.35
<S> have i not my talent left ?: 56.21
<S> he returned to france with the epaulet of sub lieutenant , and as the protection of the general , who is in the highest favor , was accorded to him , he was a captain in 1823 , during the spanish war that is to say , at the time when danglars made his early speculations .: 37.49
<S> monte cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel .: 32.37
<S> he went up to him , but , to his extreme astonishment , the stranger first addressed him .: 24.73
<S> he felt that in returning to camp he should re enter slavery ; nevertheless , he did return .: 49.72
<S> this was their mutual declaration of love .: 69.88
<S> you desire to fathom this horrible secret ? said de winter ; well , then , so be it .: 44.49
<S> he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim , and he drove us all before him , as a shepherd would his straggling flock .: 49.69
<S> yes !: 18.78
<S> i reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem unjust .: 118.44
<S> you said , let us die here ! i recall to you that word . oh , said porthos , death is nothing : it isn t death that can disquiet us , since we don t know what it is .: 42.29
<S> well , said porthos , if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when planchet would rescue rochefort and that you would protect him in it i should not have believed him ; but men are changed by events . there is nothing truer than that , said porthos ; but what does not change , or changes for the better , is wine .: 53.79
<S> but with the rapidity of thought d artagnan seized athos by the waist , and followed by porthos with aramis , leaped down from the benches , rushed into the passages , and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without , while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators , whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed .: 76.11
<S> at last we are off ! exclaimed porthos .: 26.40
<S> i don t think the sides are equal . impossible , for three reasons , replied athos .: 44.56
<S> at the usual time , morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to noirtier s room .: 18.10
<S> diavolo ! said the cardinal , pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration ; i should have cried , i should . at this moment the tumult was heard nearer .: 26.37
<S> he went to bed at his usual hour , and slept in peace .: 25.96
<S> he lodges at the ho tel des princes .: 11.23
<S> oh , dearest marie !: 34.35
<S> now , my daughter , learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune , so far as it will affect you . oh , cried euge nie , you are a bad physiognomist , if you imagine i deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me .: 45.35
<S> evidently he did not understand his meaning .: 26.40
<S> in the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which he usually wore over his blue coat , near the cross of st. louis , above the order of notre dame du mont carmel and st. lazare , and gave it to villefort in the meanwhile take this cross . sire , said villefort , your majesty mistakes ; this is an officer s cross . ma foi ! said louis xviii. , take it , such as it is , for i have not the time to procure you another .: 49.87
<S> besides , he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of athos .: 52.10
<S> when this was done , euge nie opened a drawer , of which she kept the key , and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak .: 63.78
<S> look at me , madame look around me .: 44.30
<S> are you not going to morrow morning at six o clock , louis , to bathe at conflans ?: 29.77
<S> excuse me , gentlemen , said morrel , but i do not see m. de morcerf . he sent us word this morning , replied cha teau renaud , that he would meet us on the ground . ah , said morrel .: 18.82
<S> how many rounds do they make a night ? asked d artagnan , drawing more pistoles from his pocket .: 35.38
<S> he saw a lady , a fashionable , elegantly dressed lady , and yet the door remained almost closed .: 48.53
<S> his eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of the wall , of which all the windows were closed with shutters , except one on the first story .: 29.57
<S> la houdiniere , captain of the guards the devil ! said athos ; here s a rendezvous much more serious than the other . i will go to the second after attending the first , said d artagnan .: 33.19
<S> she closed the door after her , took the duke by the hand , and after a few experimental steps , grasped a balustrade , put her foot upon the bottom step , and began to ascend the staircase .: 29.96
<S> the travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence , and ceased to address themselves to him .: 70.85
<S> the antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes , in the midst of whom , carefully watched , but calm and smiling , stood the prisoner .: 58.66
<S> he opened his mouth to reply , but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him .: 27.25
<S> athos and porthos dragged me into this to occupy me .: 73.71
<S> porthos paid his compliments to m. coquenard and bade him farewell .: 33.51
<S> the soldier replied that he was , and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to him .: 15.82
<S> milady knew the rest .: 40.61
<S> no , indeed , sir , answered raoul .: 11.86
<S> come in , gentlemen , come in , called d artagnan ; you are here in my apartment , and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal . then , gentlemen , you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received ? asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party .: 31.45
<S> if de wardes had at that moment been under his hand , he would have killed him .: 29.36
<S> i must have left it in my room , she said .: 18.93
<S> the artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture .: 93.06
<S> he arose and stood near mousqueton .: 38.67
<S> in short , why should i have any more to do with the affair ?: 16.04
<S> i will stop at the first posting house , said danglars to himself .: 24.75
<S> age has warmed , not chilled your blood .: 261.14
<S> de chevreuse was at tours .: 32.89
<S> i will extinguish the fire with blood !: 40.80
<S> when we arrive at the summit of our wishes , success has usually the power to drive away sleep on the first night after the fulfilment of long cherished hopes .: 84.90
<S> no , my guardian , replied raoul , blushing .: 16.79
<S> they were in earnest conversation .: 41.27
<S> but yourself , monsieur , said athos , who began to be annoyed by this inquisition , give me , i beg you , the proof that you have the right to question me . your name ? repeated the cavalier a second time , letting his cloak fall , and leaving his face uncovered .: 36.59
<S> triple ass ! said athos , rising ; but he sank down again immediately .: 29.57
<S> the coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired , never doubting but that the order had come from his master .: 56.51
<S> and you say that by his will he leaves me five hundred thousand livres . are you sure of it ? he showed it me ; but that is not all there is a codicil , as i said just now . probably . and in that codicil he acknowledges me . oh , the good father , the brave father , the very honest father ! said caderousse , twirling a plate in the air between his two hands .: 40.38
<S> all minds were uneasy , most were foreboding , many of the people used threatening language .: 224.91
<S> what do you say ? asked his wife , pale as death .: 11.44
<S> what am i to do ? nothing very difficult . but what is it ? to repeat these signs . monte cristo took a paper from his pocket , upon which were drawn three signs , with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked .: 34.84
<S> what need he add to such a desperate proof in figures ?: 121.58
<S> adieu . i entreat you , doctor ! all the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal .: 88.14
<S> will our help come from you ? yes . you are sure of it ? yes . there was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer , no one could , at any rate , doubt his will , if they did his power .: 44.11
<S> did you come from boulogne ? demanded she of milady .: 34.52
<S> do you place confidence in our landlord monsieur bonacieux ? i ?: 76.46
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> felton continued to descend .: 28.47
<S> from athos ! cried d artagnan , recognizing the handwriting .: 26.32
<S> you did not see her ?: 19.07
<S> m. de monte cristo saved your life ; you yourself presented him to us .: 44.00
<S> i and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway , the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that law once held out to the eternally deluded parisians , in the fantastic mississippi scheme .: 224.89
<S> believe me , continued tre ville , in enterprises of this kind , in order that one may arrive , four must set out . ah , you are right , monsieur , said d artagnan ; but you know athos , porthos , and aramis , and you know if i can dispose of them . without confiding to them the secret which i am not willing to know ? we are sworn , once for all , to implicit confidence and devotedness against all proof .: 35.30
<S> aramis blushed .: 37.79
<S> yes , continued the duke , really , i feel bored today beyond the power of description . then let us have a match in the tennis court , exclaimed la ramee .: 46.78
<S> bonacieux , but without being able to make a step , glued as she was to the spot by terror .: 42.42
<S> the marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through it .: 100.13
<S> in brief , how much remains ? twenty five pistoles , said d artagnan .: 25.29
<S> it must be done , said athos ; then in a lower and more gentle voice , he added .: 26.59
<S> and now , said d artagnan to athos , entertain no further doubts about me ; i undertake all that concerns the king . chapter lxiv .: 42.94
<S> o reilly , said the duke , leading him into the chapel , look at these diamond studs , and tell me what they are worth apiece . the goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were set , calculated , one with another , what the diamonds were worth , and without hesitation said , fifteen hundred pistoles each , my lord . how many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them ?: 69.44
<S> if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook , complying with the trademark license is very easy .: 26.06
<S> before he had taken ten steps beyond the door i had examined the house on all sides .: 43.71
<S> upon this i went and complained to the governor , who replied that i only had what i deserved , and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house . so that since that time replied d artagnan , totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host .: 61.21
<S> more than this , the conversation which had just taken place between merce de s and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them .: 41.99
<S> a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke .: 61.46
<S> am i allowed to repeat it ? yes , but cautiously , tell one thing at a time , and do not say i told you . why so ? because it is a secret just discovered . by whom ? the police . then the news originated at the prefect s last night .: 51.04
<S> ah , continued my father , still frowning , their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved ; he called them food for cannon , which was precisely all they were good for ; and i am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor ; if algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice , it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain .: 129.94
<S> there are the acts signed ; i deliver them to you without compulsion .: 60.01
<S> there can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself , said he .: 19.77
<S> you render me still more unhappy hate you , blame you you , edmond !: 96.59
<S> he now determined not to begin the game with d artagnan till he knew completely all his adversary s cards .: 54.12
<S> he sends me for that purpose , and here i am . the poor woman s head and arms fell ; her legs bent under her , and she fell on her knees .: 23.84
<S> it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day , who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice , which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence .: 53.81
<S> if we were to see you fighting , i can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent you .: 22.64
<S> i did go to monsieur d artagnan s. what was the aim of that visit ? to beg him to assist me in finding my wife .: 49.97
<S> the morning drum had just been beaten ; everyone shook off the drowsiness of night , and to dispel the humid morning air , came to take a drop at the inn .: 81.81
<S> that count of monte cristo is an original , who loves to look at the sky even at night . and where do the servants sleep ? oh , they have a house to themselves .: 62.35
<S> the host was in a lower and back room , to which athos was requested to go .: 42.98
<S> having poured out the soup , the turnkey retired .: 74.80
<S> morrel , said the count to him at length , do you repent having followed me ? no , count ; but to leave paris if i thought happiness might await you in paris , morrel , i would have left you there . valentine reposes within the walls of paris , and to leave paris is like losing her a second time . maximilian , said the count , the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth , but are buried deep in our hearts , and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them .: 56.26
<S> straw work ?: 709.85
<S> has not m. danglars informed you of the ceremony ? oh , yes , said the count ; i received a letter from him yesterday , but i do not think the hour was mentioned . possibly my father in law trusted to its general notoriety . well , said monte cristo , you are fortunate , m. cavalcanti ; it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting , and mademoiselle danglars is a handsome girl . yes , indeed she is , replied cavalcanti , in a very modest tone .: 28.18
<S> mademoiselle de villefort will share them with you ; for i entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father , now a madman , and her brother who died last september with his mother .: 66.57
<S> did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night ? there , now !: 45.06
<S> for all , even for myself among the rest , replied villefort .: 48.55
<S> say my highness is furious !: 67.19
<S> read and answer , or i will blow out your brains ! the sergeant saw that d artagnan was in earnest .: 28.02
<S> never a mistake or delay a fellow who paid like a prince .: 122.33
<S> we left paris , each with seventy five pistoles in his pocket . shall i see you again before your departure ? i think not , monsieur , unless something new should happen . well , a pleasant journey . thanks , monsieur . d artagnan left m. de tre ville , touched more than ever by his paternal solicitude for his musketeers .: 40.12
<S> you must love somebody ? no , i am alone in the world . then you will love me .: 24.03
<S> but , continued aramis , bazin is a well trained servant , and seeing that i was not alone he discreetly retired .: 51.02
<S> then , on the anniversary of the day on which i had been insulted , i hung my cassock on a peg , assumed the costume of a cavalier , and went to a ball given by a lady friend of mine and to which i knew my man was invited .: 42.21
<S> the day was passed at saint peter s alone .: 43.13
<S> he was pale , and his eyes were red and swollen ; it was evident that he had not slept .: 14.39
<S> the letters were long the four pages were covered with closely written words .: 134.40
<S> the marshal bit his fingers .: 56.48
<S> i only know one thing i dislike more , which is the sound of your voice . really ? said danglars .: 33.04
<S> arriving there , the young woman seemed to hesitate , as she had before done in the rue vaugirard .: 39.16
<S> the table at which the puritan officers were seated was round , and whether by chance or coarse intention , harrison sat with his back to the king .: 77.55
<S> sire , said villefort , the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of providence ; what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance , and i have profited by that chance , like a good and devoted servant that s all .: 55.81
<S> a newly born infant , repeated debray ; this affair becomes serious ! well , said cha teau renaud , i was not wrong just now then , when i said that houses had souls and faces like men , and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters .: 60.68
<S> your hand , for perhaps we shall not see each other again . athos put his arm around aramis s neck and embraced him .: 40.57
<S> to questions frankly put , said he , a straightforward answer should be given .: 78.77
<S> that king , who was so grand , so sublime in the hour of death , meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips , now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth .: 69.55
<S> and , like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts , this feeling was expressed in his eyes .: 86.25
<S> there are moments for if everything is not good , everything in this world is not bad in which the most rigid and the coldest soul is softened by the tears of strong emotion , heart arraigning sentiment : one of these momentary impulses actuated anne .: 132.91
<S> hush ; he is enjoying a ride with madame de guemenee . the sergeant began to laugh .: 52.89
<S> it was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution ; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her .: 80.47
<S> what is that ? he inquired .: 9.56
<S> the time of the carnival was at hand .: 20.57
<S> what are you doing , reverend sir ?: 12.35
<S> truly , it is only bastards who are thus fortunate .: 43.32
<S> the cart was returning empty to paris , and the two lackeys had agreed , for their transport , to slake the wagoner s thirst along the route .: 64.17
<S> this and some dried fruits and a flask of monte pulciano , was the bill of fare .: 85.83
<S> of this , however , be assured , that should any favorable opportunity present itself , i will not fail to offer you the choice of being present . for shame , m. de villefort ! said rene e , becoming quite pale ; don t you see how you are frightening us ? and yet you laugh . what would you have ?: 36.81
<S> in 1807 , a month before i was arrested , and a fortnight after the death of the count of spada , on the 25th of december you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory , i was reading , for the thousandth time , the papers i was arranging , for the palace was sold to a stranger , and i was going to leave rome and settle at florence , intending to take with me twelve thousand francs i possessed , my library , and the famous breviary , when , tired with my constant labor at the same thing , and overcome by a heavy dinner i had eaten , my head dropped on my hands , and i fell asleep about three o clock in the afternoon .: 47.58
<S> my dear aramis , you have the pen of a secretary of state .: 30.09
<S> he looked around him and saw mme .: 16.06
<S> the count is an affable man ; besides , he is unarmed ; at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance . two soldiers , said d artagnan , seeming to remember something , two soldiers , yes ; that , then , is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour , under my window . that is it ; they are waiting for the cardinal , or rather for bernouin , who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out . fine looking men , upon my word ! said d artagnan .: 40.45
<S> you asked me the cause of my being late , and why i come disguised .: 45.68
<S> allow me , then , to pass on , since it is not with me you have anything to do . you are right , monsieur , it is not with you that i have anything to do ; it is with madame . with madame !: 22.20
<S> the passageway sloped in a gentle descent , enlarging as they proceeded ; still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture , and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another .: 65.85
<S> take care of the executioner , d artagnan . all right .: 30.00
<S> to speak to you about me ? of what else do you imagine he would speak to me ?: 36.97
<S> in a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post boy and horses , which were harnessed , and put in the post chaise in a minute , while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap .: 47.21
<S> he smiled ; the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose .: 54.88
<S> now go down , said the abbe , folding his arms .: 24.88
<S> in addition to the levees of the king and the cardinal , there might be reckoned in paris at that time more than two hundred smaller but still noteworthy levees .: 62.96
<S> we know that the dream of his life had been to become a musketeer .: 28.23
<S> he pressed the count s hand and left .: 20.34
<S> villefort understood the king s intent .: 40.94
<S> upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words : eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us .: 174.44
<S> i was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten o clock , when i caught sight of your carriage and horses . what you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me . 40092m no , thank you , i am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now ; perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company . what on earth are you talking of ? i am to fight today . for what ? for the sake of fighting ! yes , i understand that , but what is the quarrel ?: 57.50
<S> he smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the gascon anxious .: 62.51
<S> noirtier s hair was long and white , and flowed over his shoulders ; while in his eyes , shaded by thick black lashes , was concentrated , as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others , all the activity , address , force , and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body ; and so although the movement of the arm , the sound of the voice , and the agility of the body , were wanting , the speaking eye sufficed for all .: 49.56
<S> come , come , madame ! cried d artagnan , seizing her hands , and surveying her with an ardent glance , come , be more generous .: 18.27
<S> all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf .: 43.40
<S> the three horsemen made no reply , stopped not , and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed .: 47.78
<S> the swiss were drawn up along the road , but as the road was long , they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep only .: 41.87
<S> i am all attention , said the abbe .: 12.61
<S> call an officer of justice , he said ; and stay close to me , he added , in a low tone .: 16.32
<S> women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of paris !: 154.99
<S> when that is over , you , sir , can return to paris , while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her mother in law . as you please , sir , said franz .: 27.22
<S> may i give you a friendly counsel ?: 29.57
<S> well , yes , planchet , to be sure , said athos , what is there so astonishing in that ?: 20.28
<S> alas , said athos , we depart alone . yes ; but all four together and without a scratch ; which is a consolation . we are not yet at our destination , observed the prudent d artagnan ; beware of misadventure . ah , my friend ! cried porthos , like the crows , you always bring bad omens .: 50.98
<S> first love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow , it will stifle you .: 125.78
<S> some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister .: 54.92
<S> and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls , diamonds , and other gems , many of which , mounted by the most famous workmen , were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth .: 70.71
<S> i have , therefore , as you see , great need of hearing from you .: 28.85
<S> it was necessary to reach m. de tre ville ; it was important that he should be informed of what was passing .: 15.77
<S> when the procession reached the palace , loud cries of long live their majesties ! resounded .: 101.97
<S> i won t have dante s killed i won t ! and who has said a word about killing him , muddlehead ? replied danglars .: 50.56
<S> well , my lord , what i foresaw has come to pass . what ?: 33.23
<S> on reaching la storta , the point from whence rome is first visible , the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the dome of saint peter s , which may be seen long before any other object is distinguishable .: 131.97
<S> here it is , said athos ; and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform .: 18.57
<S> the gratitude of anne of austria .: 13.59
<S> not the least noise was to be heard ; it might be imagined that he was a hundred miles from the capital .: 24.92
<S> in turning the corner of the rue montmartre , in order to reach the rue tiquetonne and the hotel de la chevrette , where he had appointed porthos to meet him , he saw at one of the windows of the hotel , that friend himself dressed in a sky blue waistcoat , embroidered with silver , and gaping , till he showed every one of his white teeth ; whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman , so handsome and so rich , who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness .: 39.25
<S> at the end of a quarter of an hour , however , surprised at the length of the journey , she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted .: 20.46
<S> see the state in which he has put me . oh , my lord ! cried the baron , i shall never console myself . and you would be quite wrong , my dear de winter , said buckingham , holding out his hand to him .: 18.58
<S> i shall be about again in a few days . why did you not have yourself conveyed to paris ?: 35.32
<S> he stopped at the door ; villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him ; then , after a brief interval , during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands , m .: 27.24
<S> this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess s box .: 51.18
<S> had a real liking for tre ville a royal liking , a self interested liking , it is true , but still a liking .: 83.42
<S> i wager that i uttered a thousand extravagances . while saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed him .: 61.66
<S> monsieur de comminges , he said .: 12.56
<S> what a gourmand you are growing ; i haven t seen you with so cheerful a face these five years . the duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought , but at that moment , as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting la ramee s ideas , grimaud entered and made a sign to la ramee that he had something to say to him .: 41.47
<S> at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates ; the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs .: 31.26
<S> as you will , replied the duke .: 17.16
<S> all paris were in the streets .: 19.74
<S> i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of ; namely , that four years afterwards , this colossus of power would be overthrown .: 82.90
<S> i adopt all customs , speak all languages .: 231.27
<S> sir , said he to the priest , i shall keep this cross in my hand till the last moment .: 24.52
<S> speak , monsieur , speak at once ! said mazarin what is the matter ? the matter is , my lord , that the duc de beaufort has contrived to escape from the chateau of vincennes . mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the news .: 25.76
<S> raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do .: 40.72
<S> there , there midnight sounds !: 136.25
<S> return , emmanuel , to your charming wife , and present my best compliments to her ; and do you , morrel , accompany me to the champs e lyse es . willingly , said maximilian ; particularly as i have business in that quarter . shall we wait breakfast for you ? asked emmanuel .: 32.76
<S> i was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone by .: 34.08
<S> the prisoners , transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo , had passed the night , each accompanied by two priests , in a chapel closed by a grating , before which were two sentinels , who were relieved at intervals .: 69.90
<S> i have almost killed myself by my needless haste .: 52.55
<S> how grateful will m. de villefort be for all your goodness ; how thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child !: 85.34
<S> tony , he said , motioning to his groom to approach .: 32.80
<S> we are going again , it appears , to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways . you will take your musketoon and your pistols . there , now !: 59.55
<S> is it possible to insult you , madame ? said athos , laughing ; he has insulted you , and he shall die ! he shall die ! replied milady ; she first , and he afterward . athos was seized with a kind of vertigo .: 28.70
<S> at the end of a year dante s was a new man .: 13.15
<S> as he passed the ho tel des gardes , he took a glance into the stables .: 15.87
<S> certes , these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged , thought the terrified d artagnan , and i , no doubt , with them ; for from the moment i have either listened to or heard them , i shall be held as an accomplice .: 59.78
<S> have you any letters for me ? inquired d artagnan , wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief .: 51.76
<S> oh , it was cruel to us , and dare i say it ? to you also . listen , my friends , said the count i may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven years the discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know .: 51.74
<S> that , you may be sure , said the gascon , means something . they then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck , defining the forms of shadows behind it .: 59.37
<S> then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him , he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning , and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt , and which , unwittingly , he drew from the scabbard from time to time .: 39.16
<S> the general drew himself up , clinging to the curtain ; he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son .: 31.12
<S> athos divided them into three groups , assumed the command of one , gave the second to aramis , and the third to porthos ; and then each group went and took their watch near an entrance .: 79.07
<S> the sitting commences at two ; it is now three , and i am to speak . go , then , and monsieur and i will strive our best to forget your absence , replied the countess , with the same tone of deep feeling .: 39.18
<S> the splendor was within .: 79.16
<S> did you ever see her furious ? no , said athos .: 21.51
<S> oh , yes , said the count , you are looking for the sailors . yes , i paid them nothing , and yet they are gone . never mind that , maximilian , said monte cristo , smiling .: 16.32
<S> what is this rent ? said he , showing d artagnan a place where it had been pierced through .: 38.26
<S> because he left no commentaries , replied la ramee , with his coarse laugh .: 32.26
<S> but no matter ; since it is at the same time the opinion of d artagnan and of athos , it must be the best . but , said aramis , shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison ? egad ! cried d artagnan , he s just the man i count upon .: 33.91
<S> as for me , i am sure of it , said the duke .: 6.24
<S> cardinal mazarin as king .: 186.23
<S> say there is no need why dante s should die ; it would , indeed , be a pity he should .: 48.31
<S> you do not understand ? asked felton .: 12.36
<S> this is frightful !: 17.61
<S> athos ! repeated m. de tre ville himself .: 12.98
<S> i am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5,000 francs .: 30.31
<S> section 5 .: 16.70
<S> alas , like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances , the baldric was glittering with gold in the front , but was nothing but simple buff behind .: 134.22
<S> he is gone !: 17.00
<S> upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching monte cristo .: 69.61
<S> formerly his paper , at any date , was taken with confidence , and was even in request .: 115.63
<S> at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness .: 28.10
<S> planchet also was lost in thought , but the subject of their reflections was not the same .: 52.39
<S> there are the horses .: 26.57
<S> paternal affection .: 167.82
<S> i am expiating a moment of selfishness , and so i always say to la carconte , when she complains , hold your tongue , woman ; it is the will of god . and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance .: 51.35
<S> i grasped it in my hand , put out the flame as quickly as i could , lighted my taper in the fire itself , and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion , recognizing , when i had done so , that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink , only appearing when exposed to the fire ; nearly one third of the paper had been consumed by the flame .: 81.61
<S> on arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart , one of the guardsmen fell .: 21.20
<S> then he will tell it me himself . i doubt it , my lord . why do you doubt it ? because the secret does not belong to him ; because , as i have told you , it has to do with a great queen . and he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that ? no , my lord , he had three colleagues , three brave men , men such as you were wishing for just now . and were these four men attached to each other , true in heart , really united ? as if they had been one man as if their four hearts had pulsated in one breast . you pique my curiosity , dear rochefort ; pray tell me the whole story . that is impossible ; but i will tell you a true story , my lord . pray do so , i delight in stories , cried the cardinal .: 49.96
<S> madame , he said to the duchess , i have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you ; it has succeeded , since you deign to receive me .: 30.41
<S> have you anything to ask of me ?: 18.22
<S> madame de villefort , however , reassured by the silence , which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine , again extended her hand , and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass .: 29.41
<S> the left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right , and they drew up the blind of the window which mazarin , less heroic than the king , had taken the precaution to lower .: 45.54
<S> well , yes , pretty well , replied d artagnan ; and besides , you see , if they put us on trial , if they cut off our heads , they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us elsewhere . yes , that is inevitable , said porthos .: 31.30
<S> it is not mercy , then , that you are about to accord , sire , it is justice . and he is in the fort l eve que ? said the king .: 17.62
<S> i became very pale ; i felt my legs fail me ; i sought for a reply , but could find none i was silent .: 54.31
<S> their three graves were there , rising above the ground , and a fourth was also there , yawning for its ghastly tenant .: 103.35
<S> good , thought milady ; she takes a pleasure in my conversation .: 68.68
<S> now , as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence , it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer , exact , precise , positive .: 156.20
<S> the count must feel sure that franz recognized him ; and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them .: 50.32
<S> imitate me .: 64.06
<S> pyramus and thisbe chapter 52 .: 50.12
<S> compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements .: 40.51
<S> the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who , like franz , preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides .: 86.16
<S> from that glass door the pale faced man went to the count s bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard .: 79.93
<S> bravo ! cried d artagnan , you sing charmingly , dear aramis .: 19.69
<S> what , said the count , do you still regret anything in the world , and yet die ? oh , i entreat you , exclaimed morrel in a low voice , do not speak another word , count ; do not prolong my punishment . the count fancied that he was yielding , and this belief revived the horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the cha teau d if .: 26.19
<S> have you any friend whose clock is too slow ? well ? go and call upon him , in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine .: 62.06
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> bonacieux was going ; that was to follow her .: 28.83
<S> we can go to brussels , lie ge , aix la chapelle ; then up the rhine to strasbourg .: 193.78
<S> this same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style , said the messenger , carelessly .: 73.06
<S> dante s half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion ; but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent .: 125.15
<S> come , my dear bazin , tell me where he is . didn t you hear me tell you , monsieur d artagnan , that i don t know where he is ? yes , certainly ; but to that i answer that it is impossible . it is , nevertheless , the truth , monsieur the pure truth , the truth of the good god . d artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man , who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis , but whose lies were bold and decided .: 28.99
<S> on approaching an outpost near the barriere des sergens , the sentinel cried out , who s there ? and d artagnan answered having first asked the word of the cardinal louis and rocroy . after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost .: 155.73
<S> the thunder growled in the distance ; but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller , caderousse , or la carconte , absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain .: 54.14
<S> how many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against mme .: 67.02
<S> the fourth and last side of your cell faces on faces on stop a minute , now where does it face ? the wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber .: 115.20
<S> what in the devil is the matter with you , my friend ? said porthos .: 12.17
<S> and he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself , gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard .: 46.22
<S> there could be no doubt that behind this little window , which threw forth such friendly beams , the pretty mme .: 72.42
<S> i thought as much , said d artagnan , wasting his strength in useless efforts .: 38.59
<S> no , no ; but wounded without doubt , killed , perhaps .: 46.81
<S> yez ; what s the dream ? said the swiss .: 41.47
<S> a man came to me and showed me an order and i followed him .: 39.50
<S> as to fortune , he had made he , humble as he was an enemy of the cardinal ; that is to say , of a man before whom trembled the greatest men of the kingdom , beginning with the king .: 38.70
<S> the first arrivals wore long cloaks , in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped ; one of them , shorter than the rest , remained pertinaciously in the background .: 75.88
<S> he called successively at the abodes of athos , porthos , and aramis .: 23.16
<S> there they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties ; the excise was , in truth , the everlasting enemy of the patron of la jeune ame lie .: 31.39
<S> d artagnan , who was by nature very curious as people generally are who possess the genius of intrigue did all he could to make out who athos , porthos , and aramis really were for under these pseudonyms each of these young men concealed his family name athos in particular , who , a league away , savored of nobility .: 133.49
<S> i was called to see him on his dying bed , that i might administer to him the consolations of religion . and of what did he die ? asked caderousse in a choking voice .: 24.69
<S> remember , this is no affair of mine , said the trembling voice of la carconte , as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below .: 45.78
<S> oh , no ! said he , but help me to die , if you can . are you a priest ? asked raoul .: 19.01
<S> adieu !: 28.11
<S> a galley slave , escaped from confinement at toulon . and what crime has he committed ? he is accused , said the commissary with his inflexible voice , of having assassinated the man named caderousse , his former companion in prison , at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the count of monte cristo . monte cristo cast a rapid glance around him .: 32.96
<S> there he ascertained that the bracieux estate was four leagues distant , but that porthos was not at bracieux .: 50.83
<S> athos waved his flag , turning his back on the guards of the city , and saluting those of the camp .: 45.83
<S> will that do ? capitally , replied m. de busigny .: 35.91
<S> let him pass . d artagnan was perhaps about to reply , when a blow , similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox , was heard .: 36.53
<S> during the three weeks that he has been with me , i have only had to reproach him with one thing being too severe with the prisoners . and who is this cerberus ? a certain monsieur grimaud , my lord . and what was he before he went to vincennes ? he was in the country , as i was told by the person who recommended him to me . and who recommended this man to you ? the steward of the duc de grammont . he is not a gossip , i hope ? lord a mercy , my lord !: 35.42
<S> the king and the cardinal are the best of friends ; their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive fools .: 76.64
<S> cries of despair resounded on all sides .: 40.53
<S> the other is , on the contrary , to all appearance a true nobleman ; but do you not fear to find him a bully ? i only fear one thing ; namely , to find a man who will not fight . do not be alarmed , said beauchamp ; he will meet you .: 32.17
<S> well ? said he , on perceiving d artagnan .: 8.06
<S> tis true , madame , answered he , that my father was a girondin , but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king s death ; he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror , and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished . true , replied the marquise , without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up ; but bear in mind , if you please , that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles ; in proof of which i may remark , that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes , your father lost no time in joining the new government ; and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin , the count noirtier became a senator . dear mother , interposed rene e , you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside . suffer me , also , madame , replied villefort , to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint me ran s , that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past .: 62.61
<S> his countenance , usually so pale , was purple with heat and passion .: 49.94
<S> no , my lord ; these places are bought .: 28.17
<S> as to my arms , it is useless to trouble you about them ; i have them . a horse for your lackey ? resumed the procurator s wife , hesitatingly ; but that is doing things in lordly style , my friend . ah , madame ! said porthos , haughtily ; do you take me for a beggar ? no ; i only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an appearance as a horse , and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule for mousqueton well , agreed for a pretty mule , said porthos ; you are right , i have seen very great spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules .: 55.63
<S> he , who for so long a time had forgotten god , began to think that miracles were possible that the accursed cavern might be discovered by the officers of the papal states , who would release him ; that then he would have 50,000 remaining , which would be sufficient to save him from starvation ; and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to him , and as he prayed he wept .: 61.39
<S> it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased ; they ask for broussel and are only too happy , if you release him to them , to live under your government . mazarin , who at the words , it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased , had pricked up his ears , thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries , down with mazarin , and pleased with gondy s suppression of this fact , he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression : madame , credit the coadjutor , who is one of the most able politicians we have ; the first available cardinal s hat seems to belong already to his noble brow . ah !: 56.69
<S> he continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve la rochelle .: 42.88
<S> but like the miser in the fable , he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure .: 34.59
<S> porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the procurator s wife in the cloister of st. magloire .: 29.36
<S> here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty : monsieur de conti received damvilliers , and having made his proofs as general , he succeeded in remaining a soldier , instead of being made cardinal .: 119.28
<S> oh , queen !: 20.03
<S> devil take it , my lord !: 13.33
<S> i am going wherever it may please the count to take me , said morrel , with a smile full of grief ; i am under his orders for the next month . oh , heavens , how strangely he expresses himself , count ! said julie .: 30.02
<S> well , asked he , what now ?: 21.72
<S> she saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted , the poor child fell and was not able to rise again .: 41.95
<S> the two prisoners a year after louis xviii . s restoration , a visit was made by the inspector general of prisons .: 66.78
<S> the judge chapter 109 .: 33.21
<S> it only remained to put it to the vote , when the president resumed : gentlemen and you , monsieur , you will not be displeased , i presume , to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness , and who has just presented himself .: 49.89
<S> section 5 .: 16.70
<S> what are you saying , doctor ? he exclaimed , raising his hands to heaven .: 10.68
<S> what beautiful furniture there must be in it ! have you ever seen the tuileries ? no . well , it surpasses that . it must be worth one s while to stoop , andrea , when that good m. monte cristo lets fall his purse . it is not worthwhile to wait for that , said andrea ; money is as plentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard . but you should take me there one day with you . how can i ?: 61.10
<S> we announce , he read , in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper , that today , the 23rd of february , will be executed andrea rondolo , guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated don ce sar torlini , canon of the church of st. john lateran , and peppino , called rocca priori , convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit luigi vampa , and the men of his band . hum !: 52.43
<S> i was no longer in the house where i had dwelt .: 19.93
<S> i should never have the courage to come down again . ah , this one is not like the other , and his madness is less affecting than this one s display of reason . what is his folly ? he fancies he possesses an immense treasure .: 42.73
<S> monsieur , she said , i i do not understand you . and , in her first paroxysm of terror , she had raised herself from the sofa , in the next , stronger very likely than the other , she fell down again on the cushions .: 39.77
<S> are we softened a little ?: 97.16
<S> our best born and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able to obtain it .: 62.33
<S> i mean that all these cries , all these complaints , these curses , produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all ; but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it . my friend , said gondy , you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man ; are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war , should we have one , and put at the command of the leader , should we find one , your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades ? yes , sir , provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end i wish to attain i mean , the remission of my sins . the war will not only be approved of , but directed by the church .: 71.57
<S> true , he might in such a case rely on the kindness of signor torlonia .: 65.37
<S> a gentleman of high birth , possessor of an ample fortune , you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier , step by step this is uncommon ; then become general , peer of france , commander of the legion of honor , you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship , without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow creatures ; this , indeed , is praiseworthy , nay , more , it is sublime . 20265m albert looked on and listened with astonishment ; he was not used to see monte cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm .: 80.76
<S> had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of ivry .: 78.63
<S> the fool !: 28.59
<S> and now , sir , resumed mousqueton , when he had rid himself of planchet , who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend s fat back , now , sir , allow me to leave you , for i could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself ; he would never forgive me for not having preceded you . this dear friend , said d artagnan , carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by porthos or his new one , then he has not forgotten me ? forgotten he ! cried mousqueton ; there s not a day , sir , that we don t expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of monsieur de gassion , or of monsieur de bassompierre . on d artagnan s lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul the last trace of youth and happiness that had survived life s disillusions .: 59.68
<S> and , my faith , the governor of the province one of the gentlemen i expected today seemed to have such a wish for him , that i gave him to him . gave him ? cried d artagnan .: 32.85
<S> moreover , it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know , and believe nothing but what they should believe .: 34.65
<S> we therefore represent six fighting men ; if we should meet a little troop of enemies , equal or even superior in number to our own , shall we charge them , raoul ? certainly , sir , replied the viscount .: 69.60
<S> we are friends , are we not ? egad !: 15.69
<S> order of the king , he said .: 25.66
<S> monsieur , said the old man , ask me nothing ; for if i dared tell you what i have seen , certainly no good would befall me . you have , then , seen something ? replied d artagnan .: 27.90
<S> accept this half pistole to drink to my health . i do not drink bazin pushed away with dignity the officer s hand tis good only for the laity . incorruptible ! murmured d artagnan ; i am unlucky ; and whilst he was lost in thought bazin retreated toward the sacristy , and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind him .: 99.54
<S> unluckily , i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood . and he said nothing as he died ? yes ; he exclaimed , oh ! i suppose , answered d artagnan , laughing , if he only said that , it did not enlighten you much . well , sir ! cried the queen .: 34.44
<S> it is your brother who sends this carriage . exactly ; but that is not all .: 29.29
<S> thank god , i am not a bravo !: 27.49
<S> as to his title and fortune as to that , madame , i have made over to him the estate of bragelonne , my inheritance , which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte . upon my soul , monsieur , said the duchess , you are a true nobleman !: 33.14
<S> i am not like you , viscount ; you like your title , do you not ? certainly , replied albert , seeing that without my title i should be nothing ; while you , sacrificing the baron , would still remain the millionaire . which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of july , replied danglars .: 48.40
<S> the successor of father marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of .: 97.36
<S> the gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls , which were picked up by la ramee and the guard .: 44.28
<S> the red duke is capital .: 71.32
<S> this evening , sir , he replied , all will be ready . chapter xlvi .: 24.09
<S> ah , you have a noble heart , said the count ; so much the better . this exclamation , which corresponded to the count s own thought rather than to what albert was saying , surprised everybody , and especially morrel , who looked at monte cristo with wonder .: 30.90
<S> it is well known how violent the king s prejudices were against the queen , and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal , who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men .: 68.36
<S> himself , my lord . but he is said to be a furious mazarinist . phew ! whistled planchet .: 66.10
<S> if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body , dante s did not intend to give them time to recognize him , but with a sudden cut of the knife , he meant to open the sack from top to bottom , and , profiting by their alarm , escape ; if they tried to catch him , he would use his knife to better purpose .: 64.28
<S> what do you wish , sir ? asked morrel ; that i should renew my promise of remaining tranquil ? noirtier s eye remained fixed and firm , as if to imply that a promise did not suffice ; then it passed from his face to his hands .: 36.13
<S> he opened the door quickly ; and milady saw him appear , pale as usual , but with his eye inflamed and almost wild .: 34.84
<S> once again , silence !: 60.23
<S> to remain silent and dignified in his presence ; from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain , by a contemptuous word ; to provoke him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignation such was her plan .: 92.19
<S> dante s gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration .: 107.07
<S> are you out of your senses , or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me ?: 40.61
<S> i require the proof of a pre engagement .: 56.16
<S> before fifteen days are gone by i shall be away from here . ah , try it ! milady , finding her thoughts betrayed , dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except agony .: 105.59
<S> my good nanette , be quiet , i beseech you , said broussel .: 28.78
<S> impossible ?: 96.81
<S> from his past life , from his resolution to shrink from nothing , the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged , sometimes against nature , that is to say , against god , and sometimes against the world , that is , against the devil .: 66.41
<S> planchet , two hours before , had asked his master for some dinner , and he had answered him with the proverb , he who sleeps , dines . and planchet dined by sleeping .: 68.02
<S> this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinalist .: 76.74
<S> now , let us return to the first .: 13.70
<S> he then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other .: 42.60
<S> we shall be safer there than in the doorway . ah , my god ! whispered mme .: 32.62
<S> really , my lord , you are his nightmare . the duke smiled with bitterness .: 19.33
<S> when they reached the side of this felucca , mordaunt , dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance , seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen .: 87.75
<S> he has made up his mind to take a wife from paris . a fine idea that of his , said danglars , shrugging his shoulders .: 27.01
<S> like the gulf between me and the past , there is an abyss between you , edmond , and the rest of mankind ; and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures .: 50.84
<S> ah , cursed gascon that i am , i get from one hobble into another .: 97.62
<S> the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones , then this stucco had been applied , and painted to imitate granite .: 70.68
<S> who goes there ?: 31.28
<S> two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard .: 62.35
<S> the jeweller , meanwhile , was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the fire la carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her guest ; and this done , she next occupied herself in arranging his supper , by spreading a napkin at the end of the table , and placing on it the slender remains of their dinner , to which she added three or four fresh laid eggs .: 120.23
<S> ah , my poor friend !: 9.58
<S> the baron appears thoughtful today , said monte cristo to her ; are they going to put him in the ministry ? not yet , i think .: 46.81
<S> grief has consumed her , said villefort yes , grief , doctor !: 88.14
<S> might not this young man be sent by his eminence ?: 50.39
<S> neither was it , as with our neighbors , the english , an atmospheric influence which darkened his countenance ; for the sadness generally became more intense toward the fine season of the year .: 93.04
<S> his first care was to see what course they were taking .: 62.36
<S> grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent .: 138.69
<S> who could be dead in that house , which villefort himself had called accursed ?: 74.64
<S> there is a carriage coming , said cha teau renaud .: 11.78
<S> did you see the postscript ? i did , indeed .: 26.71
<S> oh , this is too much , cried milady .: 10.71
<S> yes , said aramis , but that one word is the name of some town or village . armentie res , read porthos ; armentie res ?: 47.96
<S> she held in her hand a fresh billet from milady .: 44.34
<S> the very animals we were speaking of , harnessed to the count s carriage ! my dappled grays ? demanded the baroness , springing to the window .: 45.73
<S> or solitary confinement .: 373.55
<S> bonacieux tried to walk , made two steps , and sank upon her knees .: 32.30
<S> your kind attention , in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses , does not seem to have made the least impression on her .: 60.52
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> i , as a tender father and i as a dutiful son , as they choose that i shall be descended from you . whom do you mean by they ? ma foi , i can hardly tell , but i was alluding to those who wrote the letter ; you received one , did you not ? yes . from whom ? from a certain abbe busoni . have you any knowledge of him ? no , i have never seen him . what did he say in the letter ? you will promise not to betray me ? rest assured of that ; you well know that our interests are the same . then read for yourself ; and the major gave a letter into the young man s hand .: 39.80
<S> how can such enormous jars have been manufactured ? ah !: 118.90
<S> the manuscript was the great work by the abbe faria upon the kingdoms of italy .: 46.05
<S> well ? said villefort .: 10.71
<S> are you sure that no one is aware of the queen s project ? mazarin reflected .: 30.87
<S> it was already too late .: 18.30
<S> it seemed , however , even in the very face of open day , that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed , so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream , and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination .: 51.56
<S> has the law any eyes to witness your grief ?: 133.74
<S> joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought ; both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them , and nothing is outwardly apparent .: 199.82
<S> where am i ? exclaimed she ; and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm ? madame , answered the count , you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings . my wretched curiosity has brought all this about , pursued the lady .: 72.18
<S> the inn was full of disreputable looking people , who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly expedition .: 54.75
<S> contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by u.s. federal laws and your state s laws .: 14.07
<S> he found the duke reclining upon a sofa , with his hand pressed upon the wound .: 30.33
<S> and this conviction restored his strength .: 62.71
<S> uncle and nephew .: 140.48
<S> march ! it seems that i am named la bruyere , remarked d artagnan .: 45.89
<S> but when aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light that is to say , with all its advantages ; when he had pointed out to her , in exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of paris , the viceroyalty of font de l arche , in other words , of all normandy ; when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal ; when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font , madame de longueville contended no longer , except as is the custom with pretty women to contend , and defended herself only to surrender at last .: 79.60
<S> they asked a thousand livres for him .: 48.37
<S> i thought that calumny was stifled or extinct ; you have spared me till now , but since you speak of it , once for all , i tell you madame , i do not ask you to tell me , said mazarin , astounded by this returning courage .: 48.35
<S> copies were put up at the corners of the streets ; and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them , being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced .: 117.26
<S> i will go and discuss the matter with the queen . he stopped at the end of the corridor and said : i can count upon you , gentlemen , can i not ? we do not give ourselves twice over , said d artagnan ; we have given ourselves to you ; command , we shall obey . very well , then , said mazarin ; enter this cabinet and wait till i come back . and turning off he entered the drawing room by another door .: 32.94
<S> the little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night .: 32.29
<S> his wife visited for him , and this was the received thing in the world , where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride , a manifestation of professed superiority in fact , the application of the axiom , pretend to think well of yourself , and the world will think well of you , an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks , know thyself , a knowledge for which , in our days , we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing others .: 93.89
<S> well , sit down , and let us begin with these pilchards , and this fresh butter ; which i have put on some vine leaves to please you , wicked one .: 55.61
<S> it is well , said the abbe ; we have some hours before us it is now just a quarter past twelve o clock . instinctively dante s turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbe had been able so accurately to specify the hour .: 52.68
<S> grandpapa says it is a panacea . valentine smiled , but it was evident that she suffered .: 37.57
<S> andrea cavalcanti the count of monte cristo entered the adjoining room , which baptistin had designated as the drawing room , and found there a young man , of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance , who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously .: 39.92
<S> the four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother .: 30.17
<S> then , accustomed to passive obedience , he jumped down from the terrace , ran toward the lane , and at the end of twenty paces met d artagnan , who , having seen all , was coming to him .: 23.73
<S> that shoots me , said the swiss .: 23.60
<S> milady replied that she was too weak at present , and that her only desire was to be left alone .: 25.33
<S> you sustained me powerfully , sir , and i protest to you that to day i feel very lonely .: 46.16
<S> our swords ! cried d artagnan , raising his head and regaining his self possession .: 17.21
<S> will you dine with me ? asked harrison of d artagnan .: 12.36
<S> an hour after , her table was cleared ; but milady remarked that this time felton did not accompany the soldiers .: 51.67
<S> old dante s was dead , and merce de s had disappeared .: 17.08
<S> have you the money he demands ? yes , all but eight hundred piastres . the count went to his secre taire , opened it , and pulling out a drawer filled with gold , said to franz , i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself . you see , on the contrary , i come to you first and instantly , replied franz .: 37.74
<S> the first opportunity you have , undeceive him , i beg , and tell him i am nothing of the kind . franz smiled ; an instant after the count entered .: 33.85
<S> morrel took leave of him at the door , renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven o clock , and to bring emmanuel .: 24.66
<S> will you permit me to inquire , said madame de villefort , as she arose to take her leave , whether you usually reside here ? no , i do not , replied monte cristo ; it is a small place i have purchased quite lately .: 26.35
<S> i have two friends , who in this way never depart from me ; the one who gave me being , and the other who conferred knowledge and intelligence on me .: 66.80
<S> he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flower stands , the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts , and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantle piece the countess s smelling bottle , taken from its shagreen case , and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness , as he entered : my dear mother , have you been ill during my absence ? no , no , albert , but you know these roses , tuberoses , and orange flowers throw out at first , before one is used to them , such violent perfumes . then , my dear mother , said albert , putting his hand to the bell , they must be taken into the antechamber .: 58.85
<S> aramis had discovered the idea , the lackeys .: 58.29
<S> for the rest , the storm which raged within her doubled her strength , and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind .: 45.19
<S> when the procession stopped , this shadow was recognized as morrel , who , with his coat buttoned up to his throat , his face livid , and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers , leaned against a tree , situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum , so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation .: 61.95
<S> ah , mate , said caderousse , you are getting on better terms with your old landlord ! faith , yes , replied andrea , whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling .: 51.58
<S> the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she ; but less preoccupied by that pretty face than d artagnan , he had fancied he saw a second head , a man s head , inside the carriage .: 44.68
<S> god grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space .: 164.76
<S> guiche knew everybody madame de neuillan , mademoiselle d aubigne , mademoiselle de scudery , mademoiselle paulet , madame de chevreuse .: 51.17
<S> although the day had been fatiguing , neither of them was inclined to sleep .: 48.70
<S> help , help ! murmured mme .: 22.37
<S> come , now , i have hopes of obtaining what i have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise ; namely , a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past . with all my heart , replied the marquise ; let the past be forever forgotten .: 53.89
<S> a great favor !: 55.81
<S> then he has neither the parliament nor the people with him they represent the wealth of the country ; nor the nobles nor the princes , who are the military power of france . d artagnan scratched his ear .: 56.95
<S> in fact , the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when , fortunately , night came on , and enabled them to double the cape of corsica , and so elude all further pursuit .: 77.44
<S> the lights again !: 89.28
<S> the deliberations had already begun .: 52.60
<S> it shall be as you wish , madame , said villefort ; more especially since your wishes coincide with mine , and as soon as m. d e pinay arrives in paris 30319m my dear grandmother , interrupted valentine , consider decorum the recent death .: 65.92
<S> i have measures to take . she will escape us , replied the young man ; she will escape us , and it will be your fault , athos . i will be accountable for her , said athos .: 22.94
<S> planchet had followed the road ; like athos , he had discovered the stains of blood ; like athos , he had noted the spot where the horses had halted .: 48.78
<S> i will see the queen ; i will relate to her the details of the disappearance of this poor woman , of which she is no doubt ignorant .: 25.64
<S> and now , said d artagnan , as there is no longer any fear of being overheard , i hope you are going to let me into your secret . i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory , gentlemen , said athos .: 24.86
<S> midnight struck .: 40.02
<S> dante s went on , looking from time to time behind and around about him .: 38.17
<S> i was afraid , not of a struggle , but of a failure .: 36.53
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> he determined , therefore , to direct his course as clear from it as he could when , on the opposite side of the road , from behind a rock , he perceived the extremity of another musket .: 37.94
<S> dying in the arms of his children , he had been by them laid by the side of his wife , who had preceded him in eternity by two years .: 38.61
<S> they can t be nice , though they do say as fat as a dormouse . it is not a wonder they are fat , sleeping all day , and only waking to eat all night .: 74.39
<S> i have sworn to tell you all , and i will tell you all .: 9.71
<S> i swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your forehead . you make me tremble ! said the young girl .: 42.60
<S> am i not right , m. de cha teau renaud ? 40252m that is quite my opinion , said the gentleman ; nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsworn . thank you , gentlemen , replied albert , with a smile of indifference ; i shall follow your advice not because you give it , but because i had before intended to quit france .: 47.89
<S> no , no , continued danglars ; if we resolve on such a step , it would be much better to take , as i now do , this pen , dip it into this ink , and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose . and danglars , uniting practice with theory , wrote with his left hand , and in a writing reversed from his usual style , and totally unlike it , the following lines , which he handed to fernand , and which fernand read in an undertone : the honorable , the king s attorney , is informed by a friend of the throne and religion , that one edmond dante s , mate of the ship pharaon , arrived this morning from smyrna , after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo , has been intrusted by murat with a letter for the usurper , and by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist committee in paris .: 52.48
<S> rochefort passed at a gallop .: 39.01
<S> don t lose a word of what i m going to say to you , porthos .: 22.56
<S> within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions , and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you .: 151.08
<S> franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals .: 62.27
<S> valentine , tell him if you love maximilian . the count felt his heart dilate and throb ; he opened his arms , and hayde e , uttering a cry , sprang into them .: 38.06
<S> but why have two of each sort ? asked danglars .: 44.86
<S> there was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of monsieur d arminges and beat a retreat .: 50.86
<S> after remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house , and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair , she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench ; then from the bench she went to the gate .: 42.89
<S> go ; go directly ! d artagnan rose , took his hat , as if it had been his intention to obey , then , opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading to the staircase , he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of milady .: 40.67
<S> and with what did you contrive to make that ? inquired dante s .: 21.04
<S> i went to work .: 20.72
<S> well , one day when she was hunting with her husband , continued athos , in a low voice , and speaking very quickly , she fell from her horse and fainted .: 29.54
<S> certainly , we are friends , he replied ; why should we not be ? the answer was so little like the one merce de s desired , that she turned away to give vent to a sigh , which sounded more like a groan .: 38.94
<S> the catalans beyond a bare , weather worn wall , about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine , was the village of the catalans .: 59.75
<S> come , come ! cried rochefort .: 9.06
<S> but he was unable to complete this oath , for two days afterwards , in an encounter with the roman carbineers , carlini was killed .: 45.25
<S> oh , why did i not tell you all ?: 14.58
<S> let us break the carriage ! cried the people .: 19.32
<S> this is a magnificent habitation , said beauchamp , looking towards the mausoleum ; a summer and winter palace .: 48.71
<S> you formerly lived , i believe in the alle es de meilhan , on the fourth floor ? 0325m i did . and you followed the business of a tailor ? true , i was a tailor , till the trade fell off .: 52.08
<S> d artagnan charged , with a party of musketeers , up the rue du coq , and the portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke , dispersing near the place saint germain l auxerrois and taking the direction of the quays .: 65.48
<S> in ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves .: 118.95
<S> athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note , written in these terms : my dear count , when one travels , and especially for three months , one never has a superfluity of money .: 65.97
<S> what is the matter ?: 6.15
<S> listen to the voice of your heart , morrel , and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me . my friend , said maximilian , the voice of my heart is very sorrowful , and promises me nothing but misfortune . it is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud .: 48.38
<S> the duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace .: 245.69
<S> they are spanish smugglers , said he ; they have with them two corsican bandits . and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers ? alas , returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity , we ought always to help one another .: 56.64
<S> 3 knocked on the head .: 81.15
<S> the escort divided into two files .: 98.61
<S> we are going to return to the service , mouston , replied porthos , still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost .: 48.12
<S> they were playing together , as usual , when seven o clock sounded ; the patrol was heard passing to double the posts .: 44.47
<S> it was all up with him , continued aramis ; ah i much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly . athos took lord de winter s hand and tried to turn the conversation .: 79.83
<S> take my advice , renounce this woman .: 48.54
<S> they were approaching the scene of war ; and as bands of spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of arras , they determined to remain in the town until the morrow .: 62.75
<S> he therefore told him all .: 23.04
<S> there s a providence that watches over the deserving .: 96.75
<S> m. de tre ville scolded his musketeers in public , and congratulated them in private ; but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king , m. de tre ville hastened to report himself at the louvre .: 31.07
<S> oh , i have done well !: 29.72
<S> i wish to be sure of my revenge .: 16.85
<S> bonacieux , without any suspicion , accompanied her .: 34.16
<S> the lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon , which , entering through the broken ceiling , shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather , over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth .: 104.29
<S> there ensued a brief silence , during which these two persons , who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race , examined each other without embarrassment on either side .: 82.36
<S> are you , sir , the chief of the people who brought me here ? yes , your excellency .: 16.86
<S> monsieur , cried dante s , i can tell by your voice you are touched with pity ; tell me at least to hope . i can not tell you that , replied the inspector ; i can only promise to examine into your case . oh , i am free then i am saved ! who arrested you ? m .: 36.87
<S> then you will lie here , said d artagnan .: 12.51
<S> it was about one of those purchases that interest women a purchase by which much might have been gained . but the more the young woman excused herself , the more important bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him .: 99.17
<S> the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men , that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt , and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes . this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum .: 48.28
<S> d artagnan vigorously seized his prisoner s hand , saying : eh !: 19.78
<S> and why not ?: 20.26
<S> i think i can see him now , mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome saddle .: 58.27
<S> one might have said that twenty men , or rather twenty mad devils , were fighting . these words redoubled the eagerness of d artagnan , who urged his horse , though he stood in need of no incitement , and they proceeded at a rapid pace .: 48.66
<S> near the louvre the four friends met with m. de tre ville , who was returning from st. germain ; he stopped them to offer his compliments upon their appointments , which in an instant drew round them a hundred gapers .: 33.34
<S> i shall kill him i can not help it .: 22.84
<S> dressed as aramis had been the night before , the bishop got into his carriage , and the former , more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacon s dress , got in by his side .: 57.75
<S> but tell me what ? didn t he speak of me in any way ? ah !: 23.71
<S> decidedly , monsieur d artagnan , you are the man i have been seeking .: 22.50
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> but when they were alone he said , you have done that which you ought to have done , d artagnan ; but perhaps you have been wrong . d artagnan sighed deeply , for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul , which told him that great misfortunes awaited him .: 36.11
<S> the field of battle , instead , therefore , of being at saint denis or at charenton , will be near compiegne or villars cotterets . the prince will vanquish you , as he has always done . tis possible ; my lord ; but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence to another castle belonging to our friend du vallon , who has three .: 73.62
<S> oh , maximilian , how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness ? heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself !: 86.56
<S> and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom , have you not ? asked dante s eagerly .: 25.96
<S> a new governor arrived ; it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners ; he learned their numbers instead .: 73.57
<S> ought i not also to have rescued the man that i had accepted for a husband , guilty though he were ?: 148.06
<S> immediately , and according to custom , the ramparts of fort saint jean were covered with spectators ; it is always an event at marseilles for a ship to come into port , especially when this ship , like the pharaon , has been built , rigged , and laden at the old phocee docks , and belongs to an owner of the city .: 57.98
<S> born in the neighborhood of arles , she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial ; but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes and the marshes of camargue .: 113.38
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> and here , madame , i must add another word of explanation .: 22.06
<S> in consequence of this feeling of repugnance , he was about to pass without speaking to him , but , as he had done the day before , m. bonacieux accosted him .: 23.39
<S> you were deceived , sir ; i was not praying . do you think , then , madame , replied felton , in the same serious voice , but with a milder tone , do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator ?: 37.98
<S> but aramis was livid .: 29.25
<S> that , i think , is as much as i shall want . but your companions ? i don t think they can be in need of any .: 32.18
<S> it seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance . see that , now ! said porthos ; and i turned my horse aside from going plump on to him !: 60.98
<S> each of them had a ticket attached to it , by which it might be recognized ; and from that moment the sieur de la coste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues .: 30.29
<S> aramis . if that is all , it is easily done , said porthos .: 25.92
<S> we have before stated that all the servants had fled .: 42.11
<S> unfortunately porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed itself .: 107.26
<S> i reached the age of twenty nine without loving , for none of the feelings i before then experienced merit the appellation of love .: 124.49
<S> do not bring on me the horrors of remorse !: 46.85
<S> you surely will not do that , my dear count ? certainly i shall , albert , as i have promised to do it . well , said albert , with a sigh , it seems you are determined to marry me . i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody , at all events , said monte cristo .: 22.20
<S> something more terrible , more fatal , more alarming for us the child was , perhaps , alive , and the assassin may have saved it ! madame danglars uttered a piercing cry , and , seizing villefort s hands , exclaimed , my child was alive ? said she ; you buried my child alive ?: 63.58
<S> a square table , covered with books and papers , upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of la rochelle , occupied the center of the room .: 48.19
<S> that is not all , resumed lord de winter .: 11.75
<S> there are such in the world , and god will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth , but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment , but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes .: 94.64
<S> it is there , said felton , touching the bag of money with his foot .: 25.85
<S> it is over , aramis had said .: 29.09
<S> deserted ? she repeated ; ah , yes , i am , indeed , deserted !: 41.65
<S> gentlemen , did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall ?: 55.68
<S> p.s . be it well understood that the fifty louis which i send are equally for aramis as for you for you as aramis . athos smiled , and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear .: 76.40
<S> the count watched him with a feeling of compassion , and when he had completely disappeared , read as follows : the french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to three weeks since in l impartial , who not only surrendered the castle of yanina , but sold his benefactor to the turks , styled himself truly at that time fernand , as our esteemed contemporary states ; but he has since added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name .: 63.76
<S> d artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer , and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life .: 39.77
<S> she found m. bonacieux alone ; the poor man was recovering with difficulty the order in his house , in which he had found most of the furniture broken and the closets nearly emptied justice not being one of the three things which king solomon names as leaving no traces of their passage .: 149.33
<S> do you still fence well ? i i fence as well as you did in the old time better still , perhaps ; i do nothing else all day . and with whom ? with an excellent master at arms that we have here . what !: 89.20
<S> i can t see !: 27.58
<S> one now and then i don t say much about ; but seven in two days , i repeat , it is too many , it is far too many ! therefore , sire , your majesty sees that they are come , quite contrite and repentant , to offer you their excuses . quite contrite and repentant !: 58.55
<S> the road is never very safe during fair time . oh , as to the robbers , said joannes , here is something for them , and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols , loaded to the muzzle .: 41.93
<S> have you not hit upon any ? asked danglars .: 28.97
<S> give me the despatch , raoul . the young man hesitated and looked at athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of conduct .: 42.02
<S> it is woman who has ruined us , still ruins us , and will ruin us , as long as the world stands .: 46.96
<S> my dear friend , you are going to spoil everything everything is going on famously .: 32.72
<S> remain here and i will send you your clothes by the boy .: 41.76
<S> to you the only just , good , and compassionate being i have met with !: 136.02
<S> several times , with terror , no doubt , the cold sweat burst from her burning brow .: 30.55
<S> not the least in the world , replied bonacieux .: 18.69
<S> well , then , what do you think of the molli anhelitu ? admirable , sire ; but my messenger is like the stag you refer to , for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days . which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety , my dear duke , when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours , and that without getting in the least out of breath . ah , sire , you recompense but badly this poor young man , who has come so far , and with so much ardor , to give your majesty useful information .: 54.14
<S> there is only one thing which grieves me , observed the major , and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon . ah , my dear m. cavalcanti , i trust you will not leave before i have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends . i am at your service , sir , replied the major .: 20.91
<S> don t you think the executioner might be master cromwell , who , to make sure of this affair , undertook it himself ? ah !: 55.53
<S> a man who had sworn vengeance against my father , and had long watched his opportunity to kill him , had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried me .: 51.51
<S> it is my father , who has just left his study . to accompany the doctor to the door , added morrel .: 24.60
<S> you will go to marseilles , said dante s , for you understand , i repeat his words just as he uttered them .: 35.03
<S> it is said that we must not trust to the face ; but in what , then , shall we place confidence , if not in the most beautiful work of the lord ?: 38.35
<S> d artagnan looked attentively at the building .: 17.14
<S> no one has seen d artagnan and porthos has not appeared .: 30.15
<S> a lion even ? ali sprung forwards , imitating the action of one throwing the lasso , then of a strangled lion .: 173.95
<S> planchet , said d artagnan to his domestic , who just then insinuated his head through the half open door in order to catch some fragments of the conversation , go down to my landlord , monsieur bonacieux , and ask him to send me half a dozen bottles of beaugency wine ; i prefer that . ah , ah !: 40.18
<S> the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the united states .: 23.64
<S> monseigneur , said marshal de grammont , with a radiant face , will your highness permit my son , count de guiche , and his traveling companion , viscount de bragelonne , to come in and give news of the enemy , whom they have found while we were looking for him ? what ! eagerly replied the prince , will i permit ?: 50.28
<S> too late by a minute ! cried he , too late by a minute !: 44.43
<S> oh , miserable creature that i am ! cried she , clasping her hands , and raising her eyes to heaven .: 13.96
<S> it was , alas !: 26.48
<S> planchet and bazin shall go .: 76.17
<S> the second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first ; the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell dante s was surprised not to find in the outer cavern .: 81.20
<S> shall you be present in the reception room ? no ; i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office .: 39.08
<S> robert le diable chapter 54 .: 59.19
<S> this demanded new effort , but nothing compared to the first ; at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus .: 76.14
<S> in twenty minutes they were on the spot named .: 25.72
<S> the will was never wanting . to get away you would not mind , you added , knocking down a door or a wall . tis true i said so , and i say it again . and i answered you , porthos , that it was not a good plan ; that we couldn t go a hundred steps without being recaptured , because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves . that is true ; we should need clothes and arms . well , said d artagnan , rising , we have them , friend porthos , and even something better . bah ! said porthos , looking around .: 45.80
<S> then also , as athos had predicted , it became possible to find mme .: 41.01
<S> d artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace planchet as he had embraced him on his departure ; but he feared lest this mark of affection , bestowed upon his lackey in the open street , might appear extraordinary to passers by , and he restrained himself .: 46.41
<S> the parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers .: 112.15
<S> adieu ! thus tis quite decided , said d artagnan , that what i have to offer to you does not tempt you ? on the contrary , it would tempt me were i any other man , rejoined aramis ; but i repeat , i am made up of contradictions .: 45.17
<S> thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which , if not large , was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents .: 72.63
<S> why was not m. de saint me ran also grandfather to mademoiselle danglars ? albert , albert , said madame de morcerf , in a tone of mild reproof , what are you saying ?: 25.67
<S> she moved with the light , free step of an arlesienne or an andalusian .: 142.20
<S> i have touched the hand of the great man ! cried bonacieux .: 25.22
<S> providence appears to me to have no share in this affair ; and happily so , for instead of the invisible , impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments , i shall find one both palpable and visible , on whom i shall revenge myself , i assure you , for all i have suffered during the last month .: 66.92
<S> i don t speak of my brother .: 14.78
<S> on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars , who had advanced to meet him .: 24.58
<S> d artagnan , i ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you ; aramis does the same to porthos ; now hate me if you can ; but for my own part , i shall ever , even if you do hate me , retain esteem and friendship for you .: 80.86
<S> she then tried to seize the sword with her hands ; but d artagnan kept it free from her grasp , and presenting the point , sometimes at her eyes , sometimes at her breast , compelled her to glide behind the bedstead , while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kitty s apartment .: 51.57
<S> i should not have guessed it .: 12.75
<S> then he rang .: 22.83
<S> suddenly mousqueton uttered a cry of delight , taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine ; and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles , bread , and a monster junk of salted beef .: 50.60
<S> what s your business here , you hussy ? d artagnan threw off his hood , and disengaged his hands from the folds of the cloak .: 40.00
<S> athos was calm and grave , but aramis was furious ; the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself .: 60.41
<S> that depends ; when do you leave ? tomorrow evening , at five o clock . in that case i must say adieu to you , as i am compelled to go to naples , and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday morning .: 52.74
<S> madeleine , said the gascon , give me your apartment on the first floor ; now that i am a captain in the royal musketeers i must make an appearance ; nevertheless , reserve my old room on the fifth story for me ; one never knows what may happen . end of the project gutenberg ebook twenty years after updated editions will replace the previous one the old editions will be renamed .: 51.14
<S> the time had at length arrived ; two feet of earth removed , and dante s fate would be decided .: 68.58
<S> he fell back cursing with rage .: 58.28
<S> dante s turned pale , hesitated , and reflected .: 25.26
<S> until then he had been sustained by rage , by his strength of mind , by despair , by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens , and ajax to defy the gods .: 75.92
<S> believe me , to seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who loves that man .: 46.84
<S> she opened the door .: 10.45
<S> we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister , which belong to history , the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival .: 108.86
<S> it does not concern me , you are right ; and if i have sworn to revenge myself , it is not on the french captain , or the count of morcerf , but on the fisherman fernand , the husband of merce de s the catalane . ah , sir ! cried the countess , how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit ! for i am the only culprit , edmond , and if you owe revenge to anyone , it is to me , who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude . but , exclaimed monte cristo , why was i absent ?: 39.16
<S> he thought of aramis , who , without possessing any greater advantages than himself , had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse , who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day ; and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish , some in ambition , others in love , whilst others , either from chance , or from ill luck , or from some natural defect or impediment , remain half way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations .: 67.15
<S> impossible ?: 96.81

<S> monsieur , the cardinal mazarin has been so kind as to think of me , he said .: 23.81
<S> bonacieux had just attained that happy period of life .: 70.75
<S> signed , el kobbir . that this record should have all due authority , it shall bear the imperial seal , which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it . near the merchant s signature there was , indeed , the seal of the sublime emperor .: 99.31
<S> you speak of him very much at your ease , aramis ; he has probably been killed .: 31.60
<S> keep guard at the other door , athos and aramis .: 22.80
<S> listen ! said he .: 11.16
<S> at this moment villefort returned .: 10.13
<S> on receiving the warning letter you wrote to me , i had this woman arrested , and gave her in charge to a loyal servant .: 62.88
<S> the work i speak of is called a treatise on the possibility of a general monarchy in italy , and will make one large quarto volume . and on what have you written all this ? on two of my shirts .: 71.42
<S> he folded the letter fancifully , and took up his pen and wrote : to mlle .: 52.91
<S> royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns .: 18.79
<S> we have quitted business . how long ? inquired the astonished merchant .: 38.45
<S> and you , aramis , you were going , i think , to visit madame de longueville . i did go there . well ? she was no longer there , but she had left her new address . where was she ? guess ; i give you a thousand chances . how should i know where the most beautiful and active of the frondists was at midnight ?: 37.07
<S> you will find mine on my saddle , already loaded . mouston breathed a sigh ; he couldn t understand visits of ceremony made under arms .: 112.75
<S> what word , then , can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending ?: 93.04
<S> but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready , and they were arising from table , the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal .: 38.41
<S> milady was no longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment terrified him ; she was an ardent , passionate mistress , abandoning herself to love which she also seemed to feel .: 61.26
<S> last year i had four apricots they stole one , i had one nectarine , only one well , sir , they ate half of it on the wall ; a splendid nectarine i never ate a better . you ate it ? that is to say , the half that was left you understand ; it was exquisite , sir .: 68.29
<S> arrested ! he exclaimed ; he was taken at compie gne , and all is over . madame danglars rose from her seat , pale and cold .: 28.92
<S> add these four to the nine others , that would be thirteen days lost thirteen days , during which so many important events might pass in london .: 70.97
<S> by mordaunt . yes , but we have drowned monsieur mordaunt . that is true , and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity , if posterity ever looks at us .: 62.03
<S> you are only responsible for my body , is it not so ?: 30.70
<S> edmond had one friend only , and thus it can not be divided .: 65.70
<S> i am a physiognomist , i assure you . d artagnan went out first , as had been agreed upon .: 21.21
<S> we learn this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats and in many of these victories .: 66.36
<S> you will excite your blood , and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy .: 70.05
<S> i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery , perhaps crime . remember , answered the abbe calmly , as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock , it is your fault , not mine , that i do so .: 70.51
<S> i don t comprehend . you don t comprehend that i want you and your three friends to be of use to me ? which of my friends , my lord ? your three friends the friends of former days . of former days , my lord !: 41.95
<S> alone , valentine has no power ; she will be compelled to submit .: 35.04

<S> the nobleman to whom he applied , being a friend of porthos , was very ready , not to sell them , as was proposed , but to lend them .: 62.08
<S> how , sometimes , the unhappy mistake chance for providence .: 157.84
<S> dead animosities .: 52.86

<S> then , as we have said , the young girl left the bedside to see m. noirtier .: 16.05
<S> oh , saved , saved ! cried she .: 25.80
<S> grimaud alone was calm as ever .: 54.36
<S> she became excessively pale , leaned her beautiful hand upon a console , which hand appeared then like one of wax , and looking at the king with terror in her eyes , she was unable to reply by a single syllable .: 42.81
<S> nevertheless , one thing afforded him inward consolation ; it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one .: 63.32
<S> how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you ? i pledge you my word , madam , said the abbe , that my intentions are good ; and that your husband can incur no risk , provided he answers me candidly . ah , that s all very fine , retorted the woman .: 49.92
<S> but , madame , replied the count , continuing the conversation , and looking by turns at madame de villefort and valentine , have i not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before ?: 38.10
<S> he is a charming fellow , i allow , when his news is correct ; but when it is not , there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he . madame danglars was rooted to the spot ; she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack , but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort , of the dinner scene , of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days , and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate .: 51.49
<S> it is you who have come to me .: 13.98
<S> hold !: 61.43
<S> the departure chapter 113 .: 22.02
<S> oh , you can not believe what you say ! let me act as i please , felton , let me act as i please , said milady , elated .: 31.72
<S> ah , yes , about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died . of what did he die ? why , the doctors called his complaint gastro enteritis , i believe ; his acquaintances say he died of grief ; but i , who saw him in his dying moments , i say he died of caderousse paused .: 62.45
<S> he seems besotted , said danglars , pushing caderousse with his knee .: 54.06
<S> merce de s seized fernand s hands with a transport which he took for love , but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world , and seeing at last a friend , after long hours of solitary sorrow .: 69.50
<S> consent , then , i beg you , madame , to write at the bottom of this schedule , which has been drawn up by mazarin , as you see : i consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the parisians . anne was caught , she could not draw back she signed ; but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep .: 55.52
<S> enter , my sister , said the queen .: 12.46
<S> if you loved me , you would view all this otherwise .: 37.89
<S> it s tiresome work to keep awake a whole night . yes , but with a jovial partner and dice , and guineas clinking on the cloth , the night passes like a dream .: 89.29
<S> it was then that he saw a horseman , as it were , detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance .: 26.77
<S> you acknowledge , of course , that you owe this sum to him ? yes ; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years ago . when are you to pay ? half the 15th of this month , half the 15th of next . just so ; and now here are 32,500 francs payable shortly ; they are all signed by you , and assigned to our house by the holders . i recognize them , said morrel , whose face was suffused , as he thought that , for the first time in his life , he would be unable to honor his own signature .: 46.14
<S> these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect .: 41.64
<S> and clement vii. , but it will never succeed now , for they attempted it fruitlessly , and napoleon was unable to complete his work .: 78.99
<S> so you hate each other ? said the count .: 20.73
<S> someone was walking down before them , and this person , hearing the rustling of a silk dress , turned around .: 50.91
<S> and what else does your worship wish for ? to know if you have seen a young man pass , fifteen years of age , mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom ? the viscount de bragelonne ?: 36.83
<S> monte cristo watched and saw him approach the valet , who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket , containing a newspaper and a letter .: 35.24
<S> the sultan , the liberty of a woman , replied the count ; the pope , the life of a man ; so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne . and it was peppino you saved , was it not ? cried morcerf ; it was for him that you obtained pardon ? perhaps , returned the count , smiling .: 41.03
<S> the latter retained the count s hand between his .: 38.88
<S> at daybreak d artagnan entered the chamber , and demanded what was to be done .: 23.78
<S> d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise , which was not quite free from joy .: 16.86
<S> i was , replied the procureur ; you begged me not to leave . did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which madame de saint me ran has fallen a victim ? i did .: 27.28
<S> seek quietude and oblivion , so that you may return peaceably to france after a few years .: 100.13
<S> it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time .: 37.05
<S> ali appeared .: 54.24
<S> hola , lubin , my pistols ! planchet , called out d artagnan , take care of the lackey ; i will manage the master . planchet , emboldened by the first exploit , sprang upon lubin ; and being strong and vigorous , he soon got him on the broad of his back , and placed his knee upon his breast .: 56.21
<S> and king charles x. , had preserved a great number of friends , and these , added to the personages whom the usages of society gave villefort a claim on , formed a considerable body .: 118.96
<S> you were going to drink my wine ? to the health of the king , monsieur ; i was going to drink a small glass of it if fourreau had not told me i was called . alas ! said fourreau , whose teeth chattered with terror , i wanted to get him out of the way that i might drink myself . gentlemen , said d artagnan , addressing the guardsmen , you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place ; so accept my excuses , and put off the party till another day , i beg of you . the two guardsmen courteously accepted d artagnan s excuses , and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone , retired .: 41.10
<S> although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger , the queen , when his death was announced to her , would not believe the fact , and even imprudently exclaimed , it is false ; he has just written to me ! but the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence ; laporte , detained in england , as everyone else had been , by the orders of charles i. , arrived , and was the bearer of the duke s dying gift to the queen .: 41.93
<S> no , for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough , after a little quarrel we had , to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the dispute a proposition which i was wrong to suggest , and he quite right to refuse .: 56.26
<S> i have seen russians devour , without being visibly inconvenienced , vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab . and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east , and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison ? certainly ; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed . yes , i understand that ; and how would you habituate yourself , for instance , or rather , how did you habituate yourself to it ? oh , very easily .: 69.29
<S> cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs , and that would teach her prudence . i do not understand , stammered lucien .: 40.79
<S> around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies .: 133.75
<S> now that this marriage , which i know you so much disliked , is done away with , i come to you on an errand which neither m. de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake . noirtier s eyes demanded the nature of her mission .: 86.62
<S> after having deprived me of my liberty , after having deprived me of death , after having recalled me to existence , my god , have pity on me , and do not let me die in despair ! 0193m who talks of god and despair at the same time ? said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth , and , deadened by the distance , sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man s ears .: 47.23
<S> but i told him i was only mate , and that she belonged to the firm of morrel son .: 35.95
<S> we shall not interfere with each other your object is a title ; mine , money .: 82.23
<S> are you sure of it ? certain , replied grimaud .: 14.63
<S> d artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer s pretty wife for three hours ; that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black , who wished to carry her off , and that she had promised him nothing .: 41.63
<S> help , help , he murmured ; oh , god !: 26.09
<S> the attention which we have been obliged to give , during the commencement of the chapter , to the illustrious personages we have introduced into it , has diverted us for an instant from him to whom anne of austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over the cardinal ; and who , confounded , unknown , lost in the crowd gathered at one of the doors , looked on at this scene , comprehensible only to four persons the king , the queen , his eminence , and himself .: 56.48
<S> i enjoy beforehand the face the cardinal will make .: 130.80
<S> the captain of the musketeers was therefore admired , feared , and loved ; and this constitutes the zenith of human fortune .: 71.12
<S> at the same instant the gun was fired , and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head .: 17.36
<S> the monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more , for he exclaimed eagerly : go on , i know nothing , as yet ; when you have finished your story , god and i will judge . oh , father , continued the executioner , without opening his eyes , as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object , it is especially when night comes on and when i have to cross a river , that this terror which i have been unable to conquer comes upon me ; it then seems as if my hand grew heavy , as if the cutlass was still in its grasp , as if the water had the color of blood , and all the voices of nature the whispering of the trees , the murmur of the wind , the lapping of the wave united in a voice tearful , despairing , terrible , crying to me , place for the justice of god ! delirium ! murmured the monk , shaking his head .: 55.84
<S> what do you want ? said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold .: 39.64
<S> the exclamations , the insults addressed to benedetto , who remained perfectly unconcerned , the energetic gestures , the movement of the gendarmes , the sneers of the scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbance all this lasted five minutes , before the door keepers and magistrates were able to restore silence .: 83.92
<S> her name ! repeated the monk , bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it ; her name !: 40.13
<S> oh , pardon me , sir ; i can scarcely realize so great a happiness .: 30.20
<S> my offers did not arouse him , did not even tempt him . so much the worse !: 40.22
<S> it was directed to monsieur oliver cromwell , general of the army of the english nation . ah ! said d artagnan ; a singular commission . who is this monsieur oliver cromwell ? inquired porthos .: 33.34
<S> he was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ball room , that valentine ran to him , saying : oh , father , some misfortune has happened ! your grandmamma has just arrived , valentine , said m. de villefort .: 23.27
<S> i want to know the route i am to follow , said d artagnan .: 17.23
<S> ten minutes afterwards , general morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar , black pantaloons , and black gloves .: 41.03
<S> but this war may bring round a peace ; this peace will require a negotiator ; that negotiator will be me .: 137.76
<S> the queen was standing in the room , pale with anger ; her self control , however , was so great that it might have been imagined that she was calm .: 20.47
<S> it was just two o clock by albert s watch when the two friends entered into the dancing room .: 26.02
<S> scarcely was the count alone , when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock , and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck , and which never left him .: 25.04
<S> stop there , madame , for this can not last .: 43.02
<S> well , you wished to conceal your journey from me , and yet i knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier .: 33.60
<S> the assizes the benedetto affair , as it was called at the palais , and by people in general , had produced a tremendous sensation .: 58.59
<S> then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him , put the black cravat and blue frock coat at the bottom of the portmanteau , threw the hat into a dark closet , broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire , put on his travelling cap , and calling his valet , checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask , paid his bill , sprang into his carriage , which was ready , learned at lyons that bonaparte had entered grenoble , and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road , at length reached marseilles , a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes .: 66.01
<S> you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg license when you share it without charge with others .: 27.04
<S> good , thought gondy , she is going to yield . she is going to have him killed , said d artagnan to porthos , but at all events it shall not be by me .: 26.78
<S> mind your own business , wife , replied caderousse sharply .: 91.84
<S> what is the use of following the alleys ?: 26.88
<S> on their part , the three friends had reloaded their arms ; a second discharge followed the first .: 36.39
<S> i am a priest , sir , and the secrets of confession , for instance , must remain between me and god , and not between me and human justice . do not alarm yourself , monsieur , we will duly respect your conscience . at this moment the abbe pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other , throwing a bright light on the stranger s face , while his own remained obscured .: 43.90
<S> there one may learn , for instance , what , out of regard to your nervous susceptibility , i will inform you of in the drawing room , namely , that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life ; that credit sustains him as breath animates the body ; and m. de monte cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject , which i have never forgotten .: 57.26
<S> yes , but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits . there are no bandits , cried debray .: 33.18
<S> base coward !: 199.75
<S> you do not , madame ; at least , i hope not .: 18.22
<S> did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem ?: 633.18
<S> d artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising milady to renounce , by pardoning de wardes , the furious projects she had formed .: 134.26
<S> you speak first . oh , no .: 37.59
<S> the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court , mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber .: 43.31
<S> take care , you are going to immure a traveller , sinbad the sailor , a man who comes to see paris ; you are going to make a patriarch of him . 20255m oh , no , said morrel ; my sister is five and twenty , my brother in law is thirty , they are gay , young , and happy .: 33.71
<S> la ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood .: 51.16
<S> oh , the red duke !: 27.56
<S> comminges returned to his post .: 24.86
<S> while the banker was waiting in the anteroom , the door opened , and a man dressed as an abbe and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was , came in and instead of waiting , merely bowed , passed on to the farther apartments , and disappeared .: 49.11
<S> the cardinal looked , then , with great impatience for the news from england which would announce to him that buckingham would not come .: 52.96
<S> he was , if i recollect , arrested in a tavern , in company with a great many others . then he added , monsieur , you may rest assured i shall perform my duty impartially , and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain ; should he , however , be guilty , in this present epoch , impunity would furnish a dangerous example , and i must do my duty . 0097m as he had now arrived at the door of his own house , which adjoined the palais de justice , he entered , after having , coldly saluted the shipowner , who stood , as if petrified , on the spot where villefort had left him .: 53.80
<S> now that you are no longer beside me i am afraid every moment of erring .: 57.62
<S> i had him put into a leaden coffin , and i am preceding him by a few days . oh !: 47.32
<S> bonacieux , darting to the window , can it be he ? milady remained still in bed , petrified by surprise ; so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a loss .: 60.92
<S> during the night , between the 4th and 5th of september , madame morrel remained listening for every sound , and , until three o clock in the morning , she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation .: 33.30
<S> it was no longer the same man the fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed him .: 41.11
<S> d artagnan , let me confess to you what i ve been thinking about during the whole of my drive , as i looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with fiery eyes . speak out , answered d artagnan .: 62.67
<S> she for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance , impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear .: 109.25
<S> oh , it would be a sacrilege .: 19.34
<S> it is no nonsense ; it is quite true .: 20.39
<S> but monte cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile , that maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes .: 30.27
<S> my god , i am dying ! and the duke swooned .: 19.32
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> if it was valentine alone , he would speak as she passed ; if she was accompanied , and he could not speak , still he should see her , and know that she was safe ; if they were strangers , he would listen to their conversation , and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery .: 43.22
<S> he had gained much information , but not enough .: 67.28
<S> he hastened to the rendezvous , found the lackeys at their posts , placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the ho tel , and came to find athos , who had just received this information when his friends returned .: 36.43
<S> they promised , indeed , to negotiate with the pope for a cardinal s hat for him ; but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises , made by the queen and mazarin .: 48.54
<S> she blushed , and that she might not answer , clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them .: 71.48
<S> raoul was seated at table with the count de guiche and his tutor , when all at once the door opened and grimaud presented himself , travel stained , dirty , and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy executioner .: 48.47
<S> this first moment had been delayed five days , which , under any other circumstances , might have appeared rather long to m. bonacieux ; but he had , in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him , ample subjects for reflection , and as everybody knows , nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection .: 80.21
<S> that of a lieutenant of musketeers . d artagnan related to porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal , and said , taking the commission from his pocket , here , my friend , write your name upon it and become my chief . porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to d artagnan , to the great astonishment of the young man .: 28.02
<S> with your permission , said danglars , bowing , i will precede you , to show you the way . by all means , replied monte cristo ; i follow you . chapter 47 .: 19.88
<S> oh , you are an angel ! exclaimed the young man .: 8.55
<S> unlimited credit chapter 47 .: 81.59
<S> yes , madame , replied the officer .: 6.57
<S> prorsus admirabile ! continued aramis ; but which requires a profound study of both the scriptures and the fathers .: 115.66
<S> adieu , then , edmond ; i have nothing more to ask of heaven i have seen you again , and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were .: 37.89
<S> don t question me , i beg of you , but lend me a horse . my stables are at your command , viscount ; but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback .: 35.48
<S> he lost it the day before yesterday . and olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn , olivain , according to the custom of serving men well pleased with their place , relating to the tavern keeper all that he could say in favor of the young gentleman ; whilst raoul wrote on thus : sir , after a four hours march i stop to write to you , for i miss you every moment , and i am always on the point of turning my head as if to reply when you speak to me .: 56.49
<S> you see this is a fit of apoplexy , and he might be saved if he could but be bled ! has he eaten anything lately ? asked madame de villefort , eluding her husband s question .: 50.57
<S> that is doubtless our boat , said athos .: 30.02
<S> now , besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the ho tel de ville , which is next door to the bell and bottle , it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night .: 56.61
<S> albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his button hole .: 50.77
<S> on her side mme .: 24.37
<S> bah , it is now nearly healed , and i am sure it is not that which gives you the most pain . what , then ? said aramis , blushing .: 26.94
<S> de boville , receiver general of the charities . ma foi , said monte cristo ; i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures , or they would have been disputed with me . danglars again became pale , and hastened to conduct the count out .: 52.15
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> i propose to defend no one but myself , and i shall defend myself vigorously , i give you warning . very well , said the voice ; go away from here and leave the place to us . go away from here ! said d artagnan , whose purposes were in conflict with that order , that is not so easy , since i am on the point of falling , and my horse , too , through fatigue ; unless , indeed , you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood . rascal ! eh !: 36.75
<S> where is your master ? you , monsieur d artagnan ! cried grimaud , impossible . grimaud , said athos , coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown , grimaud , i thought i heard you permitting yourself to speak ? ah , monsieur , it is silence ! grimaud contented himself with pointing d artagnan out to his master with his finger .: 30.62
<S> mazarin went to the right hand and aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue .: 27.29
<S> with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre , and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet .: 36.07
<S> the fronde is a comedy , of which the first act only is played .: 56.60
<S> the consequence is that when i saw our laborers , which did not at all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours , i had recourse to a little of my old trade .: 81.19
<S> you wish to see me , and you come to england .: 17.04
<S> i understand now why they murdered him . valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man , whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold .: 57.07
<S> it is true that all was like a dream , but it was not the less frightful .: 19.18
<S> really , captain groslow , you are too much in fortune s way .: 36.06
<S> just so . then you are called monsieur grimaud ? the traveler made a sign of assent .: 34.15
<S> nothing , then , preventing my escape by this means , i examined the grounds .: 43.95
<S> a slight shock , the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh , a last cry , a convulsion of agony , proved to d artagnan that the would be assassin had saved his life .: 60.94
<S> but i could find nothing absolutely nothing .: 39.80
<S> athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of d artagnan .: 27.89
<S> look ! said the boy , there s our beadle , who is going a journey . and where is he going ? asked d artagnan .: 19.17
<S> madame , replied planchet , respectfully , i am called dulaurier , at your service . thank you , monsieur dulaurier , said the queen ; and what is your business ? madame , i am a clothier in the rue bourdonnais . that is all i wished to know , said the queen .: 16.90
<S> as a proof , remember the date of the day on which i had you bidden to come to me , and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night . that was the very evening when the abduction of mme .: 53.53
<S> he advanced towards the angle , and summoning all his resolution , attacked the ground with the pickaxe .: 44.87
<S> prepare , then , for your departure , and never despair of us .: 33.67
<S> execution chapter lxvii .: 102.85
<S> in that case , let there be no more question of what s past , and let aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him . aramis drew the letter from his pocket ; the three friends surrounded him , and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar .: 55.76
<S> they walked arm in arm , occupying the whole width of the street and taking in every musketeer they met , so that in the end it became a triumphal march .: 106.74
<S> but i require three weeks preparation ; at the end of that time i shall come and say to you , the assertion is false , and i retract it , or the assertion is true , when i shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath , or the pistols from the case , whichever you please . three weeks ! cried albert ; they will pass as slowly as three centuries when i am all the time suffering dishonor . had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me , i should have said , patience , my friend ; but you have constituted yourself my enemy , therefore i say , what does that signify to me , sir ? well , let it be three weeks then , said morcerf ; but remember , at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in m .: 53.99
<S> i congratulate you !: 21.05
<S> the order was executed .: 19.90
<S> non siete spagnuolo , he said ; non siete tedesco ; siete italiano . the prisoner started and bit his lips .: 105.25
<S> since , in our romance of the three musketeers , we took leave of d artagnan at no .: 40.54
<S> have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel , on entering the roadstead , sent forward , in order to obtain permission to enter the port , a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers ?: 42.83
<S> my dear athos ! you know that i am not alluding to you ; you are the pearl of brave , bold men .: 28.38
<S> but grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence , and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second nature .: 88.57
<S> next morning le moniteur contained the following : it was without any foundation that le messager yesterday announced the flight of don carlos and the revolt of barcelona .: 105.35
<S> very ! and all these one hundred and ninety one were royalists ? asked athos .: 72.18
<S> never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me .: 81.57
<S> just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france .: 37.87
<S> your grandfather knows , then , that a poisoner lives here ; perhaps he even suspects the person .: 96.52
<S> in crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery , he perceived de winter , who was waiting until the queen had finished her negotiation .: 46.77
<S> monte cristo watched him till he disappeared , and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture , which , in sliding partly from the frame , discovered to view a small opening , so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing room now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea .: 67.20
<S> a piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum i tasted , for i have not eaten or drunk for a long time . he had not tasted food for forty hours .: 45.03
<S> now , continued aramis , taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed , and complacently examining his hand , which was as white and plump as that of a woman , and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend , now , as you have heard , d artagnan , monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic , while i , for my part , would rather it should be ideal .: 48.42
<S> sight and hearing were the only senses remaining , and they , like two solitary sparks , remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave ; it was only , however , by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind , and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place , and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity .: 97.95
<S> he strove to collect a band of followers , and followed the footsteps of decesaris and gasparone , whom he hoped to surpass .: 67.01
<S> for me the grave opens when i pass the threshold of this house . i will fulfil all your wishes , my dear mother , said the young man .: 25.35
<S> the host opened the door of a large room , in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney .: 24.64
<S> i have answered for you .: 19.88
<S> felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall .: 16.87
<S> the drop of water rochefort had scarcely departed when mme .: 133.19
<S> this scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave grimaud for his part in it ; but on reflection he hated him more and more , being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct .: 87.03
<S> help ! sir , said comminges , declare yourself at once ; will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king ? i obey , i obey , sir ! cried broussel , trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son , who seemed determined to dispute authority .: 45.38
<S> and you shall be alone , replied the young man .: 10.35
<S> you may now retire .: 53.79
<S> when you have given the letter to lord de winter and he has read it , you will further say to him : watch over his grace lord buckingham , for they wish to assassinate him .: 46.27
<S> but , tell me , what do you ask ? nothing ; for that amounts to the same thing as if i asked you for something . the procurator s wife hung upon the arm of porthos , and in the violence of her grief she cried out , monsieur porthos , i am ignorant of all such matters !: 36.17
<S> pe re pamphile , more wine ! and caderousse rattled his glass upon the table .: 47.67
<S> after a brief silence , rendered still more solemn by the time and place , the count said , in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner : in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject , i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abbe busoni .: 47.32
<S> to doubt any longer was impossible ; there was the evidence of the senses , and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony .: 67.14
<S> i will read you the first canto .: 37.78
<S> this is all i know , but i know not , count , how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything .: 60.99
<S> you always say trifles , my dear athos ! said d artagnan , and that comes very ill from you , who have never loved . the drink deadened eye of athos flashed out , but only for a moment ; it became as dull and vacant as before .: 74.45
<S> they thought he slipped , as at first , and the witnesses , seeing he did not move , approached and endeavored to raise him , but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood .: 60.88
<S> odds fish !: 204.67
<S> according to his conviction , she was some creature of the cardinal , and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we can not account .: 59.32
<S> still further , he had seldom seen the young musketeer ; but every time he had seen him , he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance .: 30.23
<S> you are right , sir , replied the governor ; and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject .: 26.41
<S> for who is there who does not say to himself , in a society as incongruously organized as ours , perhaps some day i shall have to do with the king s attorney ? but can you not say that , sir ?: 44.62
<S> has not one of you a cross ? asked athos .: 27.49
<S> lead me to him . jacopo pointed towards the horizon .: 62.29
<S> m. d avrigny opened the door , and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup , he then carefully closed the door .: 25.12
<S> thus , we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .: 26.64
<S> now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time ; and every branch of oak , every gilded weathercock on roof of slates , reminded him that , instead of returning to the friends of his childhood , every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever .: 65.75
<S> franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper , and morrel , rejoiced at this unexpected incident , went to fetch the count , who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel .: 35.74
<S> d artagnan , monsieur . well , then , athos , porthos , aramis , and d artagnan , forward ! cried athos .: 13.18
<S> do you know ? she is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us . 50105m who is he ? whom do you mean ? the gentleman who receives us ?: 39.06
<S> he went toward the place where he had left him .: 10.02
<S> ah , that is really original , said beauchamp .: 19.29
<S> as you please , he said ; death is always death , that is forgetfulness , repose , exclusion from life , and therefore from grief . he sat down , and monte cristo placed himself opposite to him .: 40.66
<S> what did you answer him ? that the thing was impossible , seeing that you were not at home , as he could see . well , what did he say then ? that you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day ; and then he added in a low voice , tell your master that his eminence is very well disposed toward him , and that his fortune perhaps depends upon this interview . the snare is rather maladroit for the cardinal , replied the young man , smiling .: 27.45
<S> alas , i have only my tongue , but i will try to show that it is good for something .: 27.15
<S> he also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine , and found it to be nothing but that horrible montreuil the terror of all expert palates .: 97.48
<S> yes , said grimaud , with his hair standing on end .: 16.75
<S> the overture to the second act began ; and , at the first sound of the leader s bow across his violin , franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek girl , who turned around to say a few words to him , and then , leaning forward again on the railing of her box , she became as absorbed as before in what was going on .: 66.92
<S> i have made a bargain . morrel looked at the count with surprise .: 18.36
<S> when he had finished , he went to a table upon which was a salver with spanish wine and glasses .: 38.81
<S> porthos instead of returning directly home , d artagnan alighted at the door of m. de tre ville , and ran quickly up the stairs .: 19.46
<S> four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based .: 100.18
<S> monsieur d arminges was already mounted .: 32.87
<S> then bring some wine , said d artagnan .: 21.32
<S> i should like you a hundred times better if , by your intervention , i could manage to remain a bachelor , even were it only for ten years . nothing is impossible , gravely replied monte cristo ; and taking leave of albert , he returned into the house , and struck the gong three times .: 53.64
<S> faith , you are indeed right not to return to it .: 52.74
<S> gentlemen , said he , leave me alone with patrick and laporte ah , is that you , de winter ?: 37.41
<S> take him out and shoot him . the prisoner turned pale .: 37.37
<S> franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised , and began accordingly , but at the first words he was interrupted .: 66.10
<S> the countess had this portrait painted during the count s absence .: 27.44
<S> he rubbed his eyes , doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis ; and forced at last to yield to evidence , he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of porthos , the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute .: 55.50
<S> pardieu ! said athos , it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes , mattocks , and shovels .: 90.67
<S> the four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after m. de tre ville , for they were the first to whom he communicated it .: 21.32
<S> andrea appeared in despair , but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no .: 91.65
<S> the two friends were in the via dei pontefici .: 14.83
<S> certainly ; and on the other hand , my lord , you have lost it , and now , in accordance with the law of war , sir , you must buy it back again . mazarin felt a shiver run through him a chill even to his heart s core .: 35.74
<S> that s your opinion ! replied porthos .: 15.45
<S> the only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the champ de mars and satory .: 85.72
<S> now , said the unknown to franz , i do not know if you are of my opinion , but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another .: 40.55
<S> you remain in london ? said porthos .: 25.70
<S> ah ! cried the duke , will you not accept any money from me ? i wish my lord would make me one promise . what !: 26.65
<S> ah , yes , he said , i know them .: 9.89
<S> i thought i saw , said one of the servants , horsemen dressed in yellow , creeping along the bed of the stream .: 40.04
<S> the count left his box , and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars , who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise .: 62.28
<S> the sun , already high , penetrated into the room through the window , the curtains of which raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening .: 39.16
<S> no , be not anxious ; he is traveling on business and will return ere long .: 61.38
<S> he replied he replied , that the death was not a natural one , and must be attributed to what ? to poison . indeed ! said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush , or his pallor , or the intense interest with which he listened ; indeed , maximilian , did you hear that ? yes , my dear count , i heard it ; and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice . monte cristo listened , or appeared to do so , with the greatest calmness .: 48.93
<S> now my fault is repaired .: 79.29
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> oh , my dear d artagnan , resumed aramis , giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness , trust me !: 18.96
<S> bonacieux would be accused of having introduced her lover into the louvre , that was all .: 39.64
<S> maximilian has just returned , has he not , madame ? asked the count .: 23.85
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> relate what has passed during the night , since these gentlemen desire to know it . have you not taken a bastion ? said a swiss , who was drinking rum out of a beer glass .: 62.30
<S> at nine o clock , then , be ready here at the ho tel , i will come and take you . planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project , heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse .: 42.49
<S> he arrived in time .: 33.82
<S> you called me , didn t you ? and he fell , rather than sat down , on one of the seats which surrounded the table .: 43.48
<S> all is ready for to morrow evening .: 72.48
<S> where have you come from , my dear count ? said albert .: 14.18
<S> monsieur du vallon , that worthy gentleman , for , with the exception of yourself , monsieur d artagnan , there s not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as him then , my lord , replied d artagnan , pointing to the purse which mazarin still held , if you love and esteem him so much , you understand me ? be it so !: 35.24
<S> repeat it ! cried d artagnan ; it will make a little change . not so , for it is religious , replied aramis ; it is theology in verse . the devil ! said d artagnan .: 23.10
<S> but the chief , without taking the money , made a sign to him to follow .: 17.59
<S> no , everyone would do that . my dear viscount , you are dreadfully impertinent . albert advanced towards euge nie , smiling .: 41.45
<S> hollo !: 181.31
<S> between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties .: 159.70
<S> they don t burn sorcerers nowadays . no ?: 127.13
<S> i remember well that diamond , which belonged to the queen . you see , then , that i speak to you in the queen s name .: 19.19
<S> stop ! yes , doubtless , replied d artagnan , who had never been able to cram the first rudiments of that language into his head , and who had by his ignorance driven his master to despair , yes , doubtless there is one . there certainly is one , said m. de tre ville , who had a tincture of literature , and monsieur de benserade was quoting it to me the other day .: 44.31
<S> you are a brave soldier , one of the few remaining veterans of the days of henry iv .: 23.99
<S> pearls fell drop by drop , as subterranean waters filter in their caves .: 193.19
<S> at ten o clock in the morning the sieur de la coste , ensign in the king s guards , followed by two officers and several archers of that body , came to the city registrar , named clement , and demanded of him all the keys of the rooms and offices of the ho tel .: 26.14
<S> it is magnificent ! said cavalcanti , who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words .: 33.35
<S> athos , aramis , and d artagnan surrounded bicarat , and required him to surrender .: 28.46
<S> hey , friend ! cried the duke .: 15.48
<S> bowing under the weight of twenty four years reminiscences , he thought not of albert , of beauchamp , of cha teau renaud , or of any of that group ; but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her son s life , to whom he had offered his , and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret , capable of destroying forever in that young man s heart every feeling of filial piety .: 57.74
<S> am i come to a friend ? she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity .: 38.12
<S> and where is auteuil ? asked the count .: 14.70
<S> villefort ran upstairs without saying a word .: 25.77
<S> the post chaise was happily bought three days since . have you had it sent where we are to go for it ? yes . our passport ? here it is . and euge nie , with her usual precision , opened a printed paper , and read : m .: 55.14
<S> he entered without knocking , or giving any other intimation of his presence , as if he had been a friend or the master of the place .: 29.79
<S> every one arose .: 41.00
<S> whose , then , is the air we breathe ?: 67.94
<S> but marrying , as i am about to do , before all paris , i ought to be supported by an illustrious name , and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar ; now , my father is not coming to paris , is he ? he is old , covered with wounds , and suffers dreadfully , he says , in travelling . i understand ; well , i am come to ask a favor of you . of me ? yes , of you . and pray what may it be ? well , to take his part . ah , my dear sir !: 37.74
<S> tell me quickly ; my time is not my own . monsieur , said d artagnan , on quitting tarbes and coming hither , it was my intention to request of you , in remembrance of the friendship which you have not forgotten , the uniform of a musketeer ; but after all that i have seen during the last two hours , i comprehend that such a favor is enormous , and tremble lest i should not merit it . it is indeed a favor , young man , replied m. de tre ville , but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe , or rather as you appear to believe .: 36.39
<S> eh , monsieur ! said he , addressing d artagnan , don t you remember that face which is blinking yonder ? no , said d artagnan , and yet i am certain it is not the first time i have seen that visage . parbleu , i believe it is not , said planchet .: 21.11
<S> bravo !: 16.42
<S> he left the box and dice where they fell , threw the purse to the wounded man , and eagerly opened the pocketbook .: 42.07
<S> what is this that m. de villefort has been telling me ? demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word ! interrupted the procureur , shrugging his shoulders .: 29.14
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of elba ? nobody . somebody there received your packet , and gave you a letter in place of it , i think ? yes ; the grand marshal did . and what did you do with that letter ? put it into my portfolio . you had your portfolio with you , then ?: 44.46
<S> never , never ! cried both the children , throwing their arms around their father s neck .: 67.05
<S> i m surprised you have never so much as asked after him .: 65.67
<S> i am not only the most miserable of queens , but the most unhappy of mothers , the most wretched of wives .: 47.08
<S> if , perchance , m. de morcerf came , he would find m. cavalcanti in that room , where he , the betrothed of euge nie , has never been admitted . you may well say , perchance , replied the banker ; for he comes so seldom , it would seem only chance that brings him . but should he come and find that young man with your daughter , he might be displeased . he ?: 41.40
<S> heyday ! cried d artagnan , drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse ; are you not mistaken ?: 25.95
<S> do you wish for any further details ?: 30.99
<S> that is all i require .: 15.43
<S> 5 scott , of course : the son of an ill fated sire , and the father of a yet more unfortunate family , bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and unhappy death . the abbot , ch .: 118.81
<S> quick , quick !: 47.10
<S> ah ! he cried , by jove !: 13.53
<S> oh , oh ! said he ; here is a soup which is rather inviting . what the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup ? said porthos , at the sight of a pale liquid , abundant but entirely free from meat , on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipelago .: 49.75
<S> you will accompany monsieur le vicomte till grimaud rejoins you .: 78.00
<S> pardieu ! cried albert , you are not a preacher , to remain standing ! the host sat down , after having made each of them a respectful bow , which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning luigi vampa .: 41.63
<S> so , then , said he , the letter was true to the end ? did you doubt it , my dear monsieur bartolomeo ? no , indeed ; certainly not ; a good man , a man holding religious office , as does the abbe busoni , could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke ; but your excellency has not read all . ah , true , said monte cristo there is a postscript . yes , yes , repeated the major , yes there is a postscript . in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker , i send him a draft for 2,000 francs to defray his travelling expenses , and credit on you for the further sum of 48,000 francs , which you still owe me . the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript , apparently with great anxiety .: 47.53
<S> for an active , ambitious nature , like that of milady , days not spent in climbing are inauspicious days .: 152.91
<S> d artagnan , who had fixed on his color beforehand , had only to select the shade , and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer .: 69.57
<S> at the rospoli palace . the count had three windows at the rospoli palace ? yes .: 38.24
<S> the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .: 25.39
<S> mordaunt , after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep , had gone down into the cellar , convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep slumber .: 35.37
<S> tell me what i must do this time ; are there any fresh instructions ?: 61.40
<S> in this valley were magnificent gardens planted by hassen ben sabah , and in these gardens isolated pavilions .: 141.85
<S> and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue , sir , added caderousse .: 60.89
<S> on their part , the french , on seeing the four friends return at such a step , uttered cries of enthusiasm .: 50.42
<S> aramis then reperused the letter , and perceived a postscript : ps .: 93.41
<S> died , poisoned , you know by what mistake .: 103.42
<S> what possessions , what reputation , what pull , as beauchamp says , have i ?: 146.04
<S> rise and answer . peppino glanced anxiously at franz .: 106.01
<S> the queen pressed her brother and the emperor of austria to appear to be wounded , as they really were , by the policy of richelieu the eternal object of which was the abasement of the house of austria to declare war against france , and as a condition of peace , to insist upon the dismissal of the cardinal ; but as to love , there was not a single word about it in all the letter .: 43.96
<S> count , he said , you are not the same here as in paris . how so ? here you laugh . the count s brow became clouded .: 26.50
<S> are you superhuman ?: 26.96
<S> i will then release you from all your promises even that of procuring my admission into the musketeers ; for before everything , i wish to avenge myself . beware , young man ! cried tre ville .: 50.00
<S> some fragments of past splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging ; a sword , for example , richly embossed , which belonged by its make to the times of francis i , the hilt of which alone , encrusted with precious stones , might be worth two hundred pistoles , and which , nevertheless , in his moments of greatest distress athos had never pledged or offered for sale .: 127.81
<S> one day , in a moment of despair like yours , since it led to a similar resolution , i also wished to kill myself ; one day your father , equally desperate , wished to kill himself too .: 51.92
<S> if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head , rags on my back , and worn out shoes on my feet , you would not have known me . you wrong me , my boy ; now i have found you , nothing prevents my being as well dressed as anyone , knowing , as i do , the goodness of your heart .: 51.58
<S> let us recall the exact facts .: 61.28
<S> yes , it was a prison , for i tried in vain to get out of it .: 20.70
<S> he rushed toward d artagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms .: 22.98
<S> we are saved ! said valentine .: 17.33
<S> d artagnan took off his hat , and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak .: 19.26
<S> as to franz , he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte cristo .: 17.03
<S> the prisoners ! he exclaimed , jumping off his horse .: 22.34
<S> but it is beginning again , i say ! well , said the count , astonished at his perseverance , which he could not understand , and looking still more earnestly at maximilian , let it begin again , it is like the house of the atreidae ; 19 god has condemned them , and they must submit to their punishment .: 44.81
<S> in an instant , thanks to the lamp , my chamber was once more lighted .: 39.56

<S> what do you wish to say about it ? i desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified . to what do you refer ?: 34.55
<S> there ! let us dine , then , said porthos ; it is getting cold . the friends , at ease with regard to the future , did honor to the repast , the remains of which were abandoned to mousqueton , bazin , planchet , and grimaud .: 38.29
<S> this woman has come back again into england for the purpose of conspiring against my life .: 37.59

<S> i know your prosperity is great , you rascal ; you are to marry the daughter of danglars . what ?: 50.02
<S> bonacieux remained standing , mute , motionless , and pale as a statue .: 16.24
<S> it is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it , or from whom we attempt to snatch it .: 65.25

<S> mousqueton , cried d artagnan , let us be off !: 12.84
<S> who o o pla ! andrea got into the cab , which passed rapidly through the faubourg saint denis , along the faubourg saint martin , crossed the barrier , and threaded its way through the interminable villette .: 54.00
<S> i read the advertisement in one of the papers , and was tempted by the false title , a country house . it is not yet too late , cried bertuccio , eagerly ; and if your excellency will intrust me with the commission , i will find you a better at enghien , at fontenay aux roses , or at bellevue . oh , no , returned monte cristo negligently ; since i have this , i will keep it . and you are quite right , said the notary , who feared to lose his fee .: 31.46
<S> madame will be tired tonight , continued monte cristo , and will , no doubt , wish to rest .: 45.33
<S> he strictly followed the instructions he had received .: 40.88
<S> i can not explain myself ; but watch over him . emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols ; his eyes rested on the weapons , and he pointed to them .: 37.24
<S> saved ! replied the young officer .: 21.81
<S> my friend , said athos , he has given me news of raoul . and now , gentlemen , said planchet , who had not heard what they were saying , what do you intend to do ? re enter paris , if you will let us , my good planchet . let you , sir ?: 24.00

<S> each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy .: 71.76
<S> did i advise your father to sell the castle of yanina to betray silence ! said albert , with a thundering voice .: 57.42
<S> this letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the drumhead .: 77.17
<S> he would enter into the minister s schemes with the more ardor , because his natural activity would be doubled by necessity .: 55.68
<S> i will go immediately and inform him of your arrival . and philip , urged by his own curiosity , entered the gallery ; a second afterwards , monte cristo appeared on the threshold .: 32.09
<S> d artagnan , taking with him three trusses of straw , returned to the chateau , where everybody , freezing with cold and more than half asleep , envied the king , the queen , and the duke of orleans , on their camp beds .: 40.50
<S> captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus ; and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is produced from electricity , lightning , from lightning , illumination . no , replied dante s .: 90.09
<S> placed between life and death , as bernajoux was , he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth ; and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed .: 63.85
<S> but what are they to do ?: 13.19
<S> cromwell gazed a moment after him .: 49.50
<S> but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine , and kept his secret .: 40.26
<S> i received this morning five millions which i paid away ; almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me ; i put this creditor off till tomorrow and i intend leaving today , to escape that tomorrow , which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure .: 101.14
<S> my jeweler and my secretary . the valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed to obey blindly and without reply .: 71.27
<S> besides , germain was in the interests of the queen ; and if anything should happen , mme .: 31.97
<S> it is but you will not look , will you ? it is because they have had the axe , with which criminals are executed , brought and placed there on the table .: 49.07
<S> my lord duke , tis the height of ingratitude ; but your highness has never seriously thought of it ? yes , returned the duke , i must confess i sometimes think of it . still by one of your forty methods , your highness ? yes , yes , indeed . my lord , said la ramee , now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves , pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness . willingly , answered the duke , give me the pie ! i am listening , said la ramee , leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips , and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste .: 30.90
<S> what doest thou here , good for nothing ? she said , and why art thou not at notre dame ? i have been there , mother , said friquet , but i saw things happen of which master broussel ought to be warned , and so with monsieur bazin s permission you know , mother , monsieur bazin , the verger i came to speak to monsieur broussel . and what hast thou to say , boy , to monsieur broussel ? i wish to tell him , replied friquet , screaming with all his might , that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way .: 69.80
<S> charles was indeed in the midst of them , his hat on his head , his brows bent , striking his boot with his riding whip .: 40.32
<S> at that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as tre ville .: 52.56
<S> the officer took bonacieux by the arm , and led him into the antechamber , where he found his two guards .: 24.95
<S> d artagnan and planchet took each a post horse , and a postillion rode before them .: 36.92
<S> desideras diabolum , unhappy man ! cried the jesuit .: 46.53
<S> it was one of these he had uncovered , and which he must remove from its socket .: 50.34
<S> the blood mounted to his temples , his eyes became dim ; he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose , and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword .: 23.68
<S> see , planchet , said he , these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me , but at bottom they all like you . ah , monsieur , said planchet , i will succeed or i will consent to be cut in quarters ; and if they do cut me in quarters , be assured that not a morsel of me will speak . it was decided that planchet should set out the next day , at eight o clock in the morning , in order , as he had said , that he might during the night learn the letter by heart .: 41.04
<S> there , said the king , that consoles me ; they are not all traitors . at this moment winter s voice was raised with the cry of forward ! the first squadron moved off ; the second followed , and descended from the plateau .: 51.43
<S> well , then , be more affectionate , my dear villefort , said the baroness .: 14.28
<S> the horses went like the wind , and in a few minutes they were at the gates of london .: 15.62
<S> indeed , when placed beside m. de tre ville , the elegant and noble courtier , athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a comparison .: 94.85
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> all is well ; we may sleep tranquilly . on this assurance the two friends fell asleep ; and d artagnan , who was very weary , bade good night to grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak , with naked sword at his side , in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage , and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him .: 41.21
<S> heaven is as inflexible as man , and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o clock .: 29.03
<S> he is worse than that , he is a devil ! returned the turnkey .: 30.12
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> if this ship founders , like the others , he is a ruined man . and has the unfortunate man wife or children ? inquired the abbe .: 41.07
<S> oh , pray , for mercy s sake , don t fly from me .: 22.94
<S> remain neutral monseigneur , if you find that i act as becomes a gallant man . young man , said richelieu , if i shall be able to say to you at another time what i have said to you today , i promise you to do so . this last expression of richelieu s conveyed a terrible doubt ; it alarmed d artagnan more than a menace would have done , for it was a warning .: 47.22
<S> here i am in the heart of paris ; but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade sellers , and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east ; not such as i have seen it , but such as my dreams have painted it .: 40.81
<S> meanwhile , what are you going to do ? i ? yes , you . it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me . since you interest yourself in my affairs , i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions . ah , true .: 25.26
<S> resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day , d artagnan , in spite of his fatigue , prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after breakfast .: 42.60
<S> aramis mumbled verses to himself , and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache , in sign of despair .: 75.51
<S> i had known the famous vampa for more than ten years .: 36.96
<S> will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you ? an announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family . what is it ? said beauchamp , much surprised ; surely you must be mistaken . the story sent you from yanina . yanina ? yes ; really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here . such is really the case , i assure you , upon my honor !: 39.49
<S> he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent , but barrois , who had heard all that passed , had guessed his master s wishes , and had already gone to fetch one .: 31.11
<S> i will be with you directly . the young men rose and returned into the salon , while the count , again apologizing , left by another door .: 38.53
<S> come , come , sleepy head ; quick , the ladder ! but , said bazin , yawning portentously , the ladder is still at the window . the other one , the gardener s .: 64.87
<S> this amused him sometimes a little , and made him endure the siege with patience ; but it did not prevent his getting very tired , or from talking at every moment of returning to paris so that if the messengers and the spies had failed , his eminence , notwithstanding all his inventiveness , would have found himself much embarrassed .: 79.26
<S> the fortune of war , my dear viscount , the caprice of fortune ; that is the way in which these things are to be accounted for . and is her name a secret ? as regards the generality of mankind it is ; but not for you , my dear viscount , who are one of my most intimate friends , and on whose silence i feel i may rely , if i consider it necessary to enjoin it may i not do so ? certainly ; on my word of honor . you know the history of the pasha of yanina , do you not ? of ali tepelini ? 13 oh , yes ; it was in his service that my father made his fortune . true , i had forgotten that . 40062m well , what is hayde e to ali tepelini ? merely his daughter . what ?: 42.21
<S> but i excuse it , it is impossible to expect the son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven . a deep crimson suffused the countenance of villefort .: 51.07
<S> no , i would rather die . by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill fortune of the next day , to which he had condemned himself by promising merce de s to spare her son , the count at last exclaimed : folly , folly , folly ! to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at .: 76.83
<S> oh , i am very presuming , i am aware .: 26.34
<S> he is a perfect nobleman , very polite , modest , and agreeable , such as may be found constantly in italy , descendants of very ancient families .: 70.72
<S> the shoulder of athos , the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis d artagnan , in a state of fury , crossed the antechamber at three bounds , and was darting toward the stairs , which he reckoned upon descending four at a time , when , in his heedless course , he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m. de tre ville s private rooms , and striking his shoulder violently , made him utter a cry , or rather a howl .: 61.37
<S> you do not know that every day of those fourteen years i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first day ; and yet i was not aware that you had married fernand , my calumniator , and that my father had died of hunger ! can it be ? cried merce de s , shuddering .: 28.99
<S> what is this name of monte cristo ? inquired the countess , when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers , is it a family name , or the name of the estate , or a simple title ? i believe , mother , it is merely a title .: 29.80
<S> my very self , replied planchet ; but i wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud . proud toward an old friend ?: 152.50
<S> i am always prepared to go , only , as you know , i never do go , and perhaps shall go this time as little as before . in short , if i go , will you go too ? i will try . you torment me , giulio , with your fears ; and what are you afraid of , then ? of many things . what are they ? mazarin s face , smiling as it was , became clouded .: 41.15
<S> oh , if you do know him , cried julie , can you tell us where he is where we can find him ?: 25.51
<S> here is the key of the door , so that you can go in and out as you please ; you will bring the priest with you , and will oblige me by introducing him into my child s room . 50101m do you wish to see him ? i only wish to be alone .: 26.05
<S> this great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this man , who a rather improbable thing had stolen his father s letter from him was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred ?: 123.19
<S> the president again arose , and having imposed silence , said , sir , you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation , and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you . the general , putting his hand on his sword , exclaimed , if you talk of honor , do not begin by disavowing its laws , and impose nothing by violence . and you , sir , continued the president , with a calmness still more terrible than the general s anger , i advise you not to touch your sword . the general looked around him with slight uneasiness ; however he did not yield , but calling up all his fortitude , said , i will not swear . then you must die , replied the president calmly .: 47.01
<S> yes , said athos , by his own nephew . come , he was the first of us to go ; peace be to him !: 41.82
<S> he had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason ; and now these few words uttered by faria , after so painful a crisis , seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation .: 78.32
<S> we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions .: 55.52
<S> valery ; but listen .: 156.87
<S> this is the abbe of whom i spoke , said the doctor to d avrigny .: 20.32
<S> everyone , from the highest to the lowest degree , has his place on the social ladder , and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests , as in descartes theory of pressure and impulsion .: 105.58
<S> there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg electronic works .: 25.38
<S> because , replied franz , you seem to me like a man who , persecuted by society , has a fearful account to settle with it . ah ! responded sinbad , laughing with his singular laugh , which displayed his white and sharp teeth .: 39.23
<S> however , among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbe busoni and by lord wilmore , by that friend and that enemy , one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion that in no period , in no case , in no circumstance , could there have been any contact between him and me . but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe .: 106.03
<S> then they did not watch over this man .: 34.76
<S> therefore , said monte cristo feigning to mistake his meaning therefore i will not , for another instant , retard the pleasure of your meeting .: 87.85
<S> you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman ? there is no great merit due to me , for we were informed of it . you know his business here , then . pardieu , he has come to draw , but i don t know how much ! you will know presently , my friend . very well , only do not give me false information as you did the other day . what do you mean ? of whom do you speak ?: 35.77
<S> then , with a promptitude which indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by adopting the garb of the opposite sex , euge nie drew on the boots and pantaloons , tied her cravat , buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat , and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure .: 44.09
<S> raoul really felt tired , but he was desirous of testing his strength , and , brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twenty five leagues , he did not wish to fall far short of his model .: 58.65
<S> you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune ; besides , they say i am already rich in right of my mother too rich , even .: 33.29
<S> the singularity of this step , and above all its formality , had not a little surprised the banker , who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing room .: 58.53
<S> the hand of god chapter 84 .: 26.72
<S> mordaunt darted to the steps , understood all , uttered a cry , as if his very heart was pierced , and fell fainting on the stone steps .: 45.49
<S> so , sir , you wish to see all relating to the poor abbe , who really was gentleness itself . yes , you will much oblige me . go into my study here , and i will show it to you . and they both entered m. de boville s study .: 38.05
<S> he saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest ; then , after having led monte cristo around the little garden , he returned to the house .: 22.29
<S> stay !: 51.79
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> pa te s made by the successor of father marteau are described .: 83.82
<S> dante s had not been deceived he had reached the first of the two islands , which was , in fact , tiboulen .: 26.07
<S> i wrote verses in the style of benserade you , my lord ? yes , i ; shall i repeat to you some of my verses ? just as you please , my lord .: 32.69
<S> now is my time to make peace with this gallant man , said d artagnan to himself , having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation ; and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis , who was departing without paying any attention to him , monsieur , said he , you will excuse me , i hope . ah , monsieur , interrupted aramis , permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought . what , monsieur ! cried d artagnan , and do you suppose i suppose , monsieur , that you are not a fool , and that you knew very well , although coming from gascony , that people do not tread upon handkerchiefs without a reason .: 27.53
<S> you knew him , returned the inspector with a smile .: 12.64
<S> he must place his sister in one of these , and we shall be in peace . yes , said d artagnan , till she comes out . ah , my faith ! said athos , you require too much , d artagnan .: 25.71
<S> the dark space frightened her .: 75.20
<S> my mother has noticed him , and he must therefore , perforce , be remarkable . he went down to the stables , not without some slight annoyance , when he remembered that the count of monte cristo had laid his hands on a turnout which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs .: 54.05
<S> aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion .: 56.28
<S> falconers are declining .: 254.58
<S> whilst they pursue him the king might escape . it is good advice , said athos , and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him . what do you think of this counsel , winter ? asked the king , looking with admiration at these two men , whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him .: 38.52
<S> do you believe it was because i committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind henry iv .: 87.51
<S> how much do you want ? all you have in gold . i have five hundred pistoles , or thereabouts . i have as much .: 32.00
<S> really , villefort , you surprise me .: 40.03
<S> meantime , monsieur , who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc d angoule me , by bassompierre , or by schomberg , who were all eager for his post , did but little , lost his days in wavering , and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of re , where they still besieged the citadel st. martin and the fort of la pre e , as on their side the french were besieging la rochelle .: 55.25
<S> well , bring it , said athos .: 11.90
<S> in the first horseman she recognized d artagnan .: 23.94
<S> should your hand still be too weak to use this sword , raoul , so much the better .: 65.90
<S> excuse my talking of family matters , but as i shall have the honor of introducing you to the count , i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture .: 54.28
<S> in your case it would be a crime .: 27.57
<S> not here , he said ; doubtless she is in her bedroom . he rushed towards the door , found it bolted , and stopped , shuddering .: 37.84
<S> i answer for his consent . how soon can he be here ? in five days . let him come and he will find a change , i will answer for it . therefore , go and collect your fifty men and hold yourself in readiness . for what ? for everything . is there any signal for the general rally ? a knot of straw in the hat . very good .: 45.64
<S> i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man . so saying , hayde e arose , and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral , she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act .: 57.60
<S> the cold gains upon me .: 68.51
<S> 600,000 700,000 800,000 900,000 ? noirtier stopped him at the last named sum .: 213.92
<S> anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of condition . pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole on their steeds . aramis !: 152.42
<S> you have seduced this young girl ; you have outraged , defiled her .: 63.16
<S> this affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the baldric .: 67.22
<S> but it has none . in fact , the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank .: 56.60
<S> but , perhaps , you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses ? my dear love , pray do not say any more about them , and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance , only more quiet and steady . the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt , while her husband , affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture , turned towards monte cristo and said , upon my word , count , i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner .: 40.16
<S> the duke followed him with his eyes , with involuntary terror .: 20.78
<S> he obeyed , not without some uneasiness , which , momentarily increasing , caused his mind , instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey , to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake , more especially one in such a situation as danglars .: 85.25
<S> franz remained with m. de villefort ; at the gate of the cemetery morrel made an excuse to wait ; he saw franz and m. de villefort get into the same mourning coach , and thought this meeting forboded evil .: 71.37
<S> it is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you !: 34.72
<S> did the sun shine in my eyes ? and she leaned against the window .: 40.12
<S> has mankind treated me as a brother ?: 101.01
<S> in that case , replied the abbe , he should be a man blessed of god , rich , happy . caderousse smiled bitterly .: 29.75
<S> if he tells the baron , said she , i am lost for the baron , who knows very well that i shall not kill myself , will place me before him with a knife in my hand , and he will discover that all this despair is but acted . she placed herself before the glass , and regarded herself attentively ; never had she appeared more beautiful .: 47.53
<S> you were too young to know about such things . i do not remember what he did , but i have inquired and i have been told all about it . and who told you about it ? asked anne of austria , with a movement of impatience .: 23.34
<S> he was charged to tell the comte de la fere , that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege , and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field , and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her congratulations .: 29.83
<S> however , those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred , it was not to the vessel herself , for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled , the anchor a cockbill , the jib boom guys already eased off , and standing by the side of the pilot , who was steering the pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port , was a young man , who , with activity and vigilant eye , watched every motion of the ship , and repeated each direction of the pilot .: 87.68
<S> oliver cromwell . mr .: 66.08
<S> mazarin leaned out of the window .: 14.93
<S> she was looking at the sea , and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky .: 40.70
<S> the queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister .: 56.95
<S> edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed merce de s , and then again on the gloomy and menacing fernand .: 45.98
<S> finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place , and dante s began to fancy the inspector s visit but a dream , an illusion of the brain .: 70.36
<S> the handkerchief you saw had not been given to me , but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends .: 28.62
<S> madame de villefort wishes to remind you , sir , he said , that eleven o clock has just struck , and that the trial commences at twelve . well , said villefort , what then ? madame de villefort is dressed ; she is quite ready , and wishes to know if she is to accompany you , sir ? where to ? to the palais . what to do ? my mistress wishes much to be present at the trial . ah , said villefort , with a startling accent ; does she wish that ? the servant drew back and said , if you wish to go alone , sir , i will go and tell my mistress . villefort remained silent for a moment , and dented his pale cheeks with his nails .: 32.58
<S> he had learned that the pretended message from anne of austria , upon the faith of which he had come to paris , was a snare ; but instead of regaining england , he had , abusing the position in which he had been placed , declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her .: 32.85
<S> at eleven o clock came in his turn duhallier , captain of the guards , bringing with him fifty archers , who were distributed immediately through the ho tel de ville , at the doors assigned them .: 30.89
<S> she was pale and fair , with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders , had large , blue , languishing eyes , rosy lips , and hands of alabaster .: 75.84
<S> yes , yes , continued morrel ; recall the scene , for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears .: 63.53
<S> large rooms , completely stripped of furniture , bare walls upon which , here and there , shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect , windows with broken panes impossible to close , no carpets , neither guards nor servants : this is what first met the eyes of athos , to which he , touching his companion s elbow , directed his attention by his glances .: 134.34
<S> he guessed , likewise , by induction , that porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of chantilly , when the procurator s wife had proved so refractory with respect to her purse .: 56.00
<S> if your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy . ah ! said mazarin , breathing more freely .: 36.85
<S> at the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated ; the musketeers hastening to the ho tel of m. de tre ville , the guards to that of m. dessessart .: 28.49
<S> this will has already constituted hayde e heiress of the rest of my fortune , consisting of lands , funds in england , austria , and holland , furniture in my different palaces and houses , and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants , may still amount to sixty millions . 40241m he was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start , and the pen fell from his hand .: 69.53
<S> perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the musketeer .: 30.38
<S> i am waiting , my lord , till you tell me of what exploits you speak . i speak of the adventure eh , you know well what i mean . alas , no , my lord ! replied d artagnan , surprised .: 24.66
<S> i am ready to speak , my lord . ah !: 9.10
<S> to be a great chemist in the east , one must direct chance ; and this is to be achieved . madame de villefort was in deep thought , yet listened attentively .: 55.13
<S> a written examination attests it , said the cardinal , replying aloud to the mute interrogation of his majesty ; and the ill treated people have drawn up the following , which i have the honor to present to your majesty . and is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison with the word of honor of a swordsman ? replied tre ville haughtily .: 61.14
<S> i wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first invitation ; but you did not come .: 33.44
<S> the game began .: 45.82
<S> in the lucern patch chapter 58 .: 35.69
<S> they all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach .: 38.50
<S> is it your decision , athos ? resumed the gascon .: 20.35
<S> certainly , all four ; we couldn t leave our prisoners , could we ? ah !: 75.54
<S> sir , cried she , be kind , be clement , listen to my prayer !: 41.84
<S> besides , we are sent here by cardinal mazarin , and at this moment represent both the king and the cardinal , and are , therefore , as ambassadors , able to act with impunity , a thing that general oliver cromwell , who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general , is quite the man to understand .: 51.84
<S> he felt a slight disappointment , however , when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton , and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household , though great , would not support two servants , and that he must enter into the service of d artagnan .: 41.53
<S> i can not hope to be very fluent , but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes ; and that would be quite as much as i should ever require . stronger grew the wonder of dante s , who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers ; still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings , he added , then if you were not furnished with pens , how did you manage to write the work you speak of ? i made myself some excellent ones , which would be universally preferred to all others if once known .: 77.62
<S> anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son ; then she retired as silently as she had come , merely saying to laporte : try , my dear laporte , to make the king more courteous to monsieur le cardinal , to whom both he and i are under such important obligations . chapter v. the gascon and the italian .: 66.65
<S> the boat at this moment turned around , and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer athos .: 70.95
<S> one of the gates began to yield .: 28.36
<S> listen how they pull him to pieces even whilst they praise him ; one takes away from him all claim to good sense , another robs him of his poetry , a third of his originality , another of his humor , another of his independence of character , a sixth but , good heavens !: 138.56
<S> he had borne with the public prison , and with privations of all sorts ; still , by degrees nature , or rather custom , had prevailed , and he suffered from being naked , dirty , and hungry .: 74.59
<S> by degrees athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth , so pure , so fresh .: 51.85
<S> don t suppose that you are the only person who can serve me , monsieur de rochefort .: 22.91
<S> the rest of the dinner was to come .: 17.81
<S> ah , it is m. de morcerf , said monte cristo quietly ; i thought i had not heard aright . yes , it is i , said the count , whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely .: 25.03
<S> rest yourself , mother , he said .: 31.55
<S> last of all came the governor .: 180.75
<S> the room was whitewashed , as is the custom in prisons , but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner , though a stove , a bed , a chair , and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture .: 59.47
<S> my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting ; i could not bear to see her suffer .: 39.57
<S> my letter is private and confidential , and for that reason i send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels .: 43.28
<S> you promised to obey me implicitly .: 49.07
<S> the past is another thing , said athos , sighing ; the past and the future . are you afraid for your young raoul ? asked aramis .: 34.58
<S> let us see the dungeons . let us first send for two soldiers , said the governor .: 20.35
<S> the king , in return , looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and gratitude .: 23.21
<S> now it is time that the malady should be over , said she ; let me rise , and obtain some success this very day .: 42.02
<S> i am accustomed to adversity .: 28.25
<S> well , said he , they likewise have refused me . that , dear friend , is because nobody is more worthy than yourself . he took a quill , wrote the name of d artagnan in the commission , and returned it to him .: 30.38
<S> bending on one knee , he placed it reverently by the side of its mother , with its head upon her breast .: 50.77
<S> the guards , under the command of m. dessessart , took up their quarters at the minimes ; but , as we know , d artagnan , possessed with ambition to enter the musketeers , had formed but few friendships among his comrades , and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections .: 48.78
<S> good bye ; i must run away , for they would send here for me , or , rather , farewell till i see you again .: 53.31
<S> do you understand , father ?: 16.62
<S> they spurred on their horses ; the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from them .: 32.65
<S> awakened in the night by the light of the flames , she sprang out of bed , wrapped herself in a dressing gown , and attempted to escape by the door , but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames .: 34.18
<S> the duke , however , was not dead .: 12.23
<S> the departure the recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all paris .: 82.69
<S> but the rock was too heavy , and too firmly wedged , to be moved by anyone man , were he hercules himself .: 74.29
<S> of all his friends , athos was the eldest , and the least resembling him in appearance , in his tastes and sympathies .: 68.97
<S> hold my stirrup , bazin , cried aramis ; and aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility , but after a few vaults and curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat .: 73.47
<S> for very important notes , for which closer attention is required , i pricked one of my fingers , and wrote with my own blood . and when , asked dante s , may i see all this ? whenever you please , replied the abbe .: 60.77
<S> two horsemen going out as athos and aramis entered were obliged to give place to them .: 49.31
<S> to prepare her system to resist poison ? yes . by accustoming her by degrees yes , yes , yes , said noirtier , delighted to be understood .: 99.00
<S> go and call out your regiment , said he ; i can foresee that we shall have need of it directly . winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on .: 29.96
<S> one evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my water .: 128.93
<S> no , no , cried the abbe ; impossible ! dante s endeavored to renew the subject ; the abbe shook his head in token of disapproval , and refused to make any further response .: 28.09
<S> louis xviii .: 14.91
<S> i tell you that you know these things as well as i do , since this gentleman has forewarned you , both as a doctor and as a friend . oh , you rave , sir , exclaimed villefort , in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken .: 33.50
<S> d artagnan then remembered the injunction : if you value your own life or that of those who love you , remain motionless , and as if you had seen nothing . he stopped , therefore , trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous .: 79.77
<S> well , she is a monster , who , at twenty five years of age , has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals .: 37.03
<S> let us speak of my affairs , said mazarin , since you will tell me naught of yours .: 24.35
<S> the two friends , left alone , remained silent , face to face .: 42.98
<S> do you think you have to do with galley slaves , or novices in the world ?: 29.65
<S> albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers , which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick ; after which ebullition he departed not , however , without walking several times to the door of the press room , as if he had half a mind to enter .: 81.79
<S> a signed statement noirtier was prepared to receive them , dressed in black , and installed in his armchair .: 51.81
<S> he sought to tread water , in order to rest himself ; but the sea was too violent , and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation .: 29.51
<S> bonacieux and if she was returning to paris , why this fugitive rendezvous , why this simple exchange of a glance , why this lost kiss ?: 108.70
<S> let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us . and spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel , situated near the marais , for having for so long a time lived near the place royale , lord de winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling .: 70.90
<S> wait , wait ; you are going to know me .: 25.77
<S> the two men followed the company , and on leaving the faubourg st. antoine , mounted two horses properly equipped , which a servant without livery had waiting for them .: 50.49
<S> peppino remained breathless .: 58.83
<S> but i shall have a priest of vulgar mind , whose career and fortune i have ruined by my misfortune .: 43.43
<S> it was the way in which he spoke .: 11.38
<S> we engaged our word ; our word included everything .: 184.85
<S> felton was sent away .: 46.33
<S> four or five cloaks had already been lifted , with a dexterity without parallel , and not one of the victims had dared to say a word , when some fool of a fellow , less patient than the others , took it into his head to cry out , guard ! and drew upon us a patrol of archers .: 60.88
<S> no one would listen or believe me , because everyone thought me mad ; but you , who must know that i am not , listen to me , and believe me so afterwards if you will . alas , murmured edmond to himself , this is a terrible relapse !: 47.11
<S> it would be a dishonor to all the nobility . fine sport , by jove ! cried porthos , with a laugh that shook the windows .: 30.35
<S> i need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in paris court his notice , and that is , that he has come to take up his abode in paris for a year , during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of money .: 55.43
<S> you are the friend of the cardinal , for he sends you hither , and yet and yet i speak ill of him , replied milady , finishing the thought of the superior .: 42.76
<S> it concerns the best interests of your father , said the messenger .: 31.13
<S> athos and his friends , again mingling with the throng , were taking a last look at the martyr king .: 67.78
<S> besides , sir , said villefort , addressing himself to his future son in law , excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes , this unexpected will need not personally wound you ; m. noirtier s weakness of mind sufficiently explains it .: 56.39
<S> what the devil !: 8.64
<S> grimaud , thinking that they had come , as he had , to try the port wine , effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one .: 60.99
<S> and why so ? asked porthos , warmly .: 19.84
<S> ah , said andrea , deeply affected .: 15.11
<S> these narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between luigi and teresa .: 62.33
<S> can he have and she stopped .: 167.49
<S> that pale face and flaming glance appeared to villefort like a frightful apparition .: 70.28
<S> the return .: 49.86
<S> as to athos , he went out without any mystery , took his horse , which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters , in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return , carefully examined the priming of his pistols , drew his sword , and took , like a forlorn hope , the road to the camp .: 44.33
<S> do not you recollect , i came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency , as i come today to plead for justice .: 53.07
<S> to the sword , sir !: 32.83
<S> how many have you , then ? asked d artagnan .: 6.90
<S> i ask pardon of your eminence , said d artagnan , but i was so fatigued don t ask my pardon , monsieur , said mazarin , for you fatigued yourself in my service . d artagnan admired mazarin s gracious manner .: 26.12
<S> the concert must be a delightful one . they suit each other remarkably well , said danglars .: 67.27
<S> he rode on , convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive .: 46.52
<S> the audience chapter iv .: 28.69
<S> thus , then , the young men made no attempt at resistance , but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors .: 68.63
<S> what does your worship want ? demanded the host , pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made .: 31.88
<S> grimaud showed his closed hand , with two fingers spread out .: 103.36
<S> monte cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet , and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock , silently opened the door , taking care that the light should shine directly on his face .: 48.14
<S> you don t imagine he would consider a little thing like that ? at any rate , said porthos , i am glad to hear d artagnan admit that he is afraid . i not only confess it , but am proud of it , returned the gascon ; i m not such a rhinoceros as you are .: 34.13
<S> from this moment vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon ; he purchased powder and ball , and everything served him for a mark the trunk of some old and moss grown olive tree , that grew on the sabine mountains ; the fox , as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion ; the eagle that soared above their heads : and thus he soon became so expert , that teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report , and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased , with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand .: 151.34
<S> mr .: 92.47
<S> well , m. de villefort , how would you advise me to act ? asked he .: 11.50
<S> the hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence .: 36.14
<S> as the night before , d artagnan did not return home till five o clock in the morning .: 11.43
<S> you are a lieutenant ?: 21.66
<S> hark , said she , we have been overheard !: 38.25
<S> bring them here . the waiter did as he was desired .: 57.09
<S> toxicology chapter 53 .: 65.51
<S> i recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me , while i managed to stammer forth : i did not do it !: 73.88
<S> this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator , who had just designated him by the name of aramis .: 48.17
<S> i recollect now , said the officer , in a jeering tone ; well , what do you want with me ? i want you to spare time to take a walk with me . tomorrow morning , if you like , with the greatest pleasure . no , not tomorrow morning , if you please , but immediately . if you absolutely insist . i do insist upon it . come , then .: 28.88
<S> grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything .: 70.24
<S> when she wakes she can sup . and he made some steps toward the door .: 36.62
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> see paragraph 1.e below .: 65.00
<S> at ten o clock the next day they met again .: 10.89
<S> the man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise .: 13.37
<S> and blood , too !: 56.82
<S> he certainly bodes us no good , said athos ; but let us embark ; once out at sea , let him come . and athos sprang into the boat , which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers .: 90.59
<S> this is what had happened .: 20.59
<S> there fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast , projects so tumultuous , that there remained no room for any capricious or material love that sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption .: 297.69
<S> do you understand me ?: 9.28
<S> be easy , my dear edmond , we are near the conclusion .: 20.31
<S> wife , wife ! cried he in a hoarse voice , come here ! diamond ! exclaimed la carconte , rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step ; what diamond are you talking about ? why , did you not hear all we said ? inquired caderousse .: 34.02
<S> franz , who had mutely interrogated the countess , and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome , sought not to retard the gratification of albert s eager impatience , but began at once the tour of the house , closely followed by albert , who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar , and to arrange the lappets of his coat .: 64.04
<S> the first impulse of these three , and of those who last entered , was to cast an inquiring glance at each other .: 32.20
<S> when he had perused the documents , an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance , and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile , he said , in very excellent tuscan : then there is no longer any such thing , in italy as being condemned to the galleys ? the major drew himself up to his full height .: 39.05
<S> did you come here to fetch me ?: 27.19
<S> but the child the child , sir ? repeated the agitated mother .: 57.85
<S> d artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to m. de tre ville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinal s arms .: 31.25
<S> d artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal .: 18.26
<S> adieu ; i will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him . go straight to his box ; that will be the simplest plan . but i have never been presented . presented to whom ? to the beautiful greek . you say she is only a slave ? while you assert that she is a queen , or at least a princess .: 46.16
<S> me ! said nanette .: 70.66
<S> after having stood a few minutes in the cavern , the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp , dante s eye , habituated as it was to darkness , could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern , which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds .: 53.44
<S> my servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play , who , because they have only a word or two to say , aquit themselves in the most awkward manner possible .: 109.18
<S> a thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre , and masked a portion of the front ; around this shrubbery two alleys , like two arms , extended right and left , and formed a carriage drive from the iron gates to a double portico , on every step of which stood a porcelain vase , filled with flowers .: 65.02
<S> you have not returned that visit , and you were wrong . monseigneur , i feared i had incurred disgrace with your eminence . how could that be , monsieur ?: 44.96
<S> but it s of no importance , continued d artagnan , with natural assurance ; it s of no importance .: 32.72
<S> each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house , and yet astonished , even uneasy though they were , they still felt that they would not like to be absent .: 59.44
<S> three days afterward pistache was found dead poisoned .: 175.47
<S> then , cried planchet joyously , i see well that it is the same comte de la fere whom we seek .: 39.10
<S> albert instantly rose to meet him , but franz remained , in a manner , spellbound on his chair ; for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum , and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina , but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo .: 43.94
<S> for forty years , he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support .: 34.65
<S> he was with you just now .: 40.45
<S> then the landing began .: 41.17
<S> i believe that the spirit of god led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph ; the secret cause of my presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart .: 92.09
<S> five minutes after , m. de tre ville was asking d artagnan what he could do to serve him , and what caused his visit at so late an hour .: 35.67
<S> oh , beautiful life !: 37.46
<S> she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care . and what is her name ? hayde e , replied monte cristo .: 30.21
<S> where she was known as la belle provenc ale . she was the widow of the marquis de castellane when she married de ganges , and having the misfortune to excite the enmity of her new brothers in law , was forced by them to take poison ; and they finished her off with pistol and dagger . ed .: 82.49
<S> you will see , said the man proudly ; in five minutes he will speak . i have , then , five minutes , said monte cristo to himself ; it is more time than i require .: 21.97
<S> she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages .: 34.95
<S> the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau , a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing ; and even then the precaution seemed superfluous , the wall was so high .: 72.49
<S> that has cured me of beautiful , poetical , and loving women , said athos , after a considerable pause , raising his head , and forgetting to continue the fiction of the count .: 32.88
<S> athos and aramis again questioned planchet , but he had seen nothing of d artagnan ; they wished to take planchet with them , but he could not leave his troop , who at five o clock returned home , saying that they were returning from the battle , whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of louis xiii .: 42.10
<S> athos was happy happy as he had never been before .: 61.32
<S> behold nebuchadnezzar ! exclaimed an old puritan soldier , whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant .: 55.09
<S> he would be condemned to die , but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life .: 28.54
<S> you seek me , sir , said he .: 9.03
<S> let us speak french , my father , said he to the jesuit ; monsieur d artagnan will enjoy our conversation better . yes , replied d artagnan ; i am fatigued with reading , and all this latin confuses me . certainly , replied the jesuit , a little put out , while the curate , greatly delighted , turned upon d artagnan a look full of gratitude .: 31.74
<S> that dark point yonder is the isle of dogs .: 111.07
<S> oh , enough of this , enough of this , he cried ; let me save the last . on entering his house , he met morrel , who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb .: 63.25
<S> he quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him ; they were the heads of the two soldiers .: 76.54
<S> you will have sufficient time before five o clock ; despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first station .: 53.75
<S> ah , said he , they have sent some fencing master to fight with me . the president , without answering , approached the witness who held the lantern , and raising his sleeve , showed him two wounds he had received in his arm ; then opening his coat , and unbuttoning his waistcoat , displayed his side , pierced with a third wound .: 46.86
<S> now , in my turn , let me give you my instructions . i am all attention . present yourself at the wicket of the louvre , on the side of the rue de l echelle , and ask for germain . well , and then ? he will ask you what you want , and you will answer by these two words , tours and bruxelles . he will at once put himself at your orders . and what shall i command him ? to go and fetch monsieur laporte , the queen s valet de chambre . and when he shall have informed him , and monsieur laporte is come ? you will send him to me . that is well ; but where and how shall i see you again ? do you wish to see me again ? certainly . well , let that care be mine , and be at ease . i depend upon your word . you may . d artagnan bowed to mme .: 28.70
<S> they employ him because they are afraid of him .: 46.95
<S> morcerf thanked him with a smile , and pushed open the door above which were his arms , and which , as we have said , opened into the salon .: 26.95
<S> if he persists his eminence made a pause , and resumed : if he persists well , then i shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of states . if your eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history , said milady , perhaps i should partake of your confidence as to the future . well , here , for example , said richelieu : when , in 1610 , for a cause similar to that which moves the duke , king henry iv. , of glorious memory , was about , at the same time , to invade flanders and italy , in order to attack austria on both sides .: 51.48
<S> my first visit was to the thicket .: 24.05
<S> if we are not , we shall have all the time to talk , and nobody will hear us for i guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears ; if we are , we will talk of our affairs just the same .: 38.87
<S> you see , said porthos , this is my usual style . devil take me ! answered d artagnan , i wish you joy of it .: 21.16
<S> and in proof that he fears nothing , that he counts on nothing , he will restore monsieur de mazarin to your majesty without conditions .: 68.61
<S> i have chosen a trade . a trade ?: 74.85
<S> cucumetto had been there , however , by accident , as he said , and had carried the maiden off .: 36.35
<S> come ! milady opened the window , and made a sign to mme .: 13.21
<S> the noise was caused by porthos , who had just knocked down his man .: 28.17
<S> henceforth we have nothing to fear .: 23.86
<S> imposing silence , grimaud put out the little night lamp , then knelt down and poured into the lieutenant s ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith .: 173.18
<S> i waited patiently , not to overhear what they said , but because i could do nothing else ; besides , the same thing had occurred often before .: 52.86
<S> i must , however , do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion , because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one .: 71.03
<S> the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs . oh , what a magnificent jewel ! cried the astonished woman .: 28.93
<S> there is very little amusement in the cloister , and the good superior was eager to make the acquaintance of her new boarder .: 50.14
<S> i will efface that blot on my father s character .: 36.93
<S> if there had been no bolt , it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st. sebastian , encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi vampa .: 54.33
<S> who are you , in the first place , to ask me to take a turn with you ? i am lieutenant in his majesty s musketeers , said d artagnan , and consequently your superior in everything ; only , as the question now is not of rank , but of quarters you know the custom come and seek for yours ; the first to return will recover his chamber . d artagnan led away the swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of the hostess , who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former lover , though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that haughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand .: 53.46
<S> your host ? that is to say , yes and no . how yes and no ? he furnishes it , it is true , but he does not know that he has that honor . explain yourself , mousqueton ; your conversation is full of instructive things . that is it , monsieur .: 40.72
<S> oh , let them come in !: 26.94
<S> our mission is ended , and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent . the young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant : you will follow these men and not lose sight of them ; when you have discovered where they lodge , come and await me at the town gate . the sergeant made a sign of comprehension .: 42.79
<S> was it a transient vision , or was he face to face with reality ?: 209.37
<S> and you did cry ? he asked .: 24.23
<S> however , this is much , and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness . at these words there appeared in noirtier s eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there : you are mistaken ; i can still do much for you . do you think you can help me , dear grandpapa ? said valentine .: 48.38
<S> he is scarcely five feet high . bravo bravo ! cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier , bravo , fair paulet , it is high time to put little voiture in his right place .: 78.31
<S> ah , ha , said the shipowner , i am not in the least surprised , for she has been to me three times , inquiring if there were any news of the pharaon .: 29.19
<S> he promised .: 49.76
<S> every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo ; every day , at nine o clock in the morning , the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside , and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest s breviary .: 38.55
<S> and they pursued their road in mournful silence .: 73.74
<S> dream of vengeance chapter xxxvii .: 61.19
<S> d artagnan returned .: 10.24
<S> what else can a strapping chap of twenty one mean with a fine wench of seventeen ? and you say that dante s has gone to the catalans ? he went before i came down . let us go the same way ; we will stop at la re serve , and we can drink a glass of la malgue , whilst we wait for news . come along , said caderousse ; but you pay the score . of course , replied danglars ; and going quickly to the designated place , they called for a bottle of wine , and two glasses .: 54.22
<S> monsieur bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house ; it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance , but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves , to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20,000 francs apiece for his horses .: 53.60
<S> how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches not on the same night as he had stated , but the next morning , the count of monte cristo went out by the barrie re d enfer , taking the road to orle ans .: 34.46
<S> gentlemen , we are arrived ; take the gate on the left .: 41.22
<S> if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle .: 58.01
<S> the face of the shortest of those three gentlemen ? no . he looked to me but tis impossible . at this instant the sergeant , who had been for his orders , returned , and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks , said : the passports are in order ; let these three gentlemen pass . the three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission .: 50.59
<S> the horse and servant belonging to de winter were waiting for him at the door ; he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully , looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the louvre .: 53.08
<S> many people have been assassinated in a tumult , but even criminals have rarely been insulted during trial .: 87.31
<S> arriving unexpectedly in sight of the isle of re with ninety vessels and nearly twenty thousand men , he had surprised the comte de toiras , who commanded for the king in the isle , and he had , after a bloody conflict , effected his landing .: 83.58
<S> but , said d artagnan , shall we not pursue that woman ? later , said athos .: 24.81
<S> athos ! cried d artagnan , wringing his hands .: 8.11
<S> why i think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do , and that they would not be so black if they didn t mean mischief . that s my opinion too , said the captain , and i ll take precautions accordingly .: 53.33
<S> i examined the thicket with my dark lantern ; it was empty .: 44.50
<S> he advanced slowly toward milady , who had seated herself , and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect , or perhaps by design , she allowed to be seen , what is this , madame ? he asked coldly .: 43.02
<S> that man made a deep impression on me ; i shall never forget his countenance ! 20025m the englishman smiled imperceptibly .: 75.22
<S> do not despair !: 30.19
<S> the young woman continued to advance ; and in addition to the lightness of her step , which had betrayed her , she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice .: 36.99
<S> he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis , and to aramis in order to learn something of porthos .: 40.00
<S> monte cristo called the owner , who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare .: 66.84
<S> the three lieutenants of the generalissimo .: 64.46
<S> all the preparations were made with a frightful calmness .: 25.28
<S> franz was too far off to hear what they said ; but , without doubt , nothing hostile passed , for he saw albert disappear arm in arm with the peasant girl .: 89.18
<S> yes , you are right ; let us go , porthos , but let us go well armed ; were we not to keep the rendezvous , they would declare we were afraid .: 30.82
<S> the general remark is , oh , it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as m. villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters .: 90.18
<S> you do not know what felicity from heaven , what joys from paradise , are comprised in a moment like that .: 99.66
<S> we will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the landes , and we shall have complete success . do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to sunday morning ? parbleu ! said albert , do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of rome , like lawyers clerks ? i hasten to comply with your excellencies wishes ; only , i tell you beforehand , the carriage will cost you six piastres a day . and , as i am not a millionaire , like the gentleman in the next apartments , said franz , i warn you , that as i have been four times before at rome , i know the prices of all the carriages ; we will give you twelve piastres for today , tomorrow , and the day after , and then you will make a good profit . but , excellency said pastrini , still striving to gain his point .: 55.95
<S> i see you now .: 18.68
<S> you go to madame d aguillon s , and you pay your court to her ; you go to madame de bois tracy s , the cousin of madame de chevreuse , and you pass for being far advanced in the good graces of that lady .: 41.45
<S> it seems that his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science , doubtless ? no ; that his style of writing is very good . this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins , to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red , and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out ? albert laughed .: 151.62
<S> and i thank you ; have what you will ; and he made a sign to franz to take what he pleased .: 39.72
<S> then d artagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter , in the rue de la calandre , a respectable looking house ; and this d artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle .: 39.58
<S> the young man uttered a cry , and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself .: 14.61
<S> porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary ; in his pride he fancied that every one must know the chateau du vallon .: 59.99
<S> this will teach you , said d artagnan , to treat the guests god sends you in a more courteous fashion . god ?: 53.56
<S> that night brought together all those comrades of the guards of m. dessessart and the company of musketeers of m. de tre ville who had been accustomed to associate together .: 38.15
<S> dante s approached the upper rock , which now , without any support , leaned towards the sea .: 35.40
<S> half an hour , an hour , an hour and a half elapsed , and during this period of anguish , edmond leaned over his friend , his hand applied to his heart , and felt the body gradually grow cold , and the heart s pulsation become more and more deep and dull , until at length it stopped ; the last movement of the heart ceased , the face became livid , the eyes remained open , but the eyeballs were glazed .: 50.51
<S> the acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one ; they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance , as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey .: 93.26
<S> faithful to his mission of vengeance , athos had requested to be conducted to the garden ; and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman , who left sharp tracks wherever she went , he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood , and causing it to be opened , he went out into the forest .: 53.82
<S> milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene .: 38.01
<S> where is this lemonade ? asked the doctor eagerly .: 15.33
<S> do you know that i die to morrow at ten o clock ? something , your majesty , will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible . the king looked at aramis with astonishment .: 38.76
<S> drink a glass of port , said aramis ; it will refresh you . yes , let us drink , said athos , anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with d artagnan , let us drink and get away from this hateful country .: 31.18
<S> on his right hand and his left were two footmen , with the seams of their dresses laced .: 30.31
<S> at all events , should you be wounded , write to me that very instant , or get some one at once to write to me .: 45.61
<S> a prisoner , you will not recover your liberty through me ; living , you will not lose your life through me . yes , cried milady , but i shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life , i shall lose my honor , felton ; and it is you , you whom i make responsible , before god and before men , for my shame and my infamy . this time felton , immovable as he was , or appeared to be , could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him .: 48.28
<S> then i can well understand your indignation , my dear albert .: 29.82
<S> no , replied athos ; and he oh , he !: 19.50
<S> as he passed by m. noirtier s room , he perceived two figures through the half open door ; but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father ; anxiety carried him on further .: 67.95
<S> oh , the deuce !: 18.48
<S> a little farther a little farther , said the other .: 36.65
<S> my dear fellow ! cried he , springing up , is it really you ?: 22.87
<S> what promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience i have evinced ? none whatever .: 120.82
<S> simply this , said the coadjutor .: 35.78
<S> 29 the carolina not virginia jessamine , gelsemium sempervirens properly speaking not a jessamine at all has yellow blossoms .: 902.41
<S> besides , what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the cardinal !: 39.57
<S> none , on my word !: 22.88
<S> i attach great importance to the question i am about to put to you .: 30.68
<S> those born to wealth , and who have the means of gratifying every wish , said emmanuel , know not what is the real happiness of life , just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather . monte cristo rose , and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow step .: 70.31
<S> every minute athos was forced to restrain d artagnan , constantly in advance of the little troop , and to beg him to keep in the line , which in an instant he again departed from .: 51.73
<S> as for patience , i consider that i have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before , and every night renewing the task of the day .: 55.95
<S> you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind ? oh , my dear count , exclaimed danglars , i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you . no , you merely wished to be convinced , nothing more ; but now that we have come to so clear an understanding , and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest , we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year , suppose we say six millions to six millions ! gasped danglars so be it . then , if i should require more , continued monte cristo in a careless manner , why , of course , i should draw upon you ; but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year , and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned .: 65.33
<S> and the crew ? asked morrel .: 19.93
<S> heigh , sir , said d artagnan , trying to laugh , do you know we look very much like a flock of silly , mouse evading women !: 38.24
<S> adieu , adieu , dearest edmond ! cried merce de s , stretching out her arms to him from the balcony .: 28.98
<S> yes , my dear aramis , we all know that your views have a religious tendency . i am only temporarily a musketeer , said aramis , humbly .: 39.57
<S> my dear monsieur de rochefort !: 12.46
<S> i am quite of your opinion , sir , and we should soon make an end of mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself , without prejudices , vigilant and incorruptible . but , said the officer , i thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to general cromwell . that is to say i am in the king s service , and that knowing he wanted to send some one to england , i solicited the appointment , so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms .: 43.88
<S> oh , what is the matter ? cried dante s .: 7.18
<S> grimaud fell precipitated into the moat .: 66.36
<S> the king advanced toward madame the president , with whom he was to dance , and his highness monsieur with the queen .: 45.02
<S> help ! cried d artagnan .: 7.92
<S> mousqueton trembled in all his members .: 80.84
<S> the secret cave the sun had nearly reached the meridian , and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks , which seemed themselves sensible of the heat .: 72.39
<S> he recognized albert , but thought it better not to notice him , as he looked so angry and discomposed .: 65.24
<S> fire ! replied the steward .: 23.00
<S> it gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play , but i have said nothing either to the one or to the other .: 61.80
<S> he had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and , according to the calculations of the four friends , they had the entire day before them , since , the executioner being absent , another must be sent for to bristol .: 62.53
<S> raoul , learn how to distinguish the king from royalty ; the king is but a man ; royalty is the gift of god .: 49.95
<S> one day when i cursed providence for making me so wicked , and ordaining me to such a fate , my adopted father said to me , do not blaspheme , unhappy child , the crime is that of your father , not yours , of your father , who consigned you to hell if you died , and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive . after that i ceased to blaspheme , but i cursed my father .: 79.32
<S> and will you direct us ? exclaimed the young man .: 19.42
<S> his excellency does not receive visitors today . then here is my master s card , the baron danglars .: 79.33
<S> you have been in my service a year , your fund has already begun to accumulate let it continue to do so . this address , delivered in the presence of ali , who , not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken , stood wholly unmoved , produced an effect on m. baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character and disposition of french domestics .: 85.86
<S> yes , christian and surname are the same .: 48.98
<S> but , towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by , faria , not seeing the young man appear , tried to move and get over the distance which separated them .: 75.39
<S> at the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard .: 13.63
<S> ho !: 16.63
<S> he cherished the thought of the duel , hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds .: 98.52
<S> some time after our rupture , you wished to study music , under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the the a tre italien ; at the same time i felt inclined to learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in london .: 103.44
<S> the rendezvous chapter xxiv .: 28.79
<S> the enemy was marching upon lens , with the intention , doubtless , of securing possession of that town and separating from france the army of france .: 64.54
<S> one day as i was setting off on an expedition , go , said she ; at your return i will give you a surprise . i questioned her , but in vain ; she would tell me nothing , and i departed .: 38.37
<S> volume four 40010m 40012m 40020m chapter 74 .: 170.64
<S> the aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the cannon .: 53.63
<S> i know these lovers .: 48.81
<S> bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu , and she was to take away mme .: 35.16
<S> i am come to talk to you about a thousand things ; but , first tell me , were you going out or just returned ? i was going out , sir . then , in order not to hinder you , i will get up with you if you please in your carriage , and tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow . no , said the count , with an imperceptible smile of contempt , for he had no wish to be seen in the young man s society , no ; i prefer listening to you here , my dear m. andrea ; we can chat better in doors , and there is no coachman to overhear our conversation . the count returned to a small drawing room on the first floor , sat down , and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also .: 35.92
<S> do think of it , giulio !: 45.70
<S> the only time i have worn these studs was at a ball given by the king eight days ago at windsor .: 90.85
<S> porthos , however , found that he had no straw left for himself .: 35.98
<S> why , the thing has made a tremendous noise . yes , i heard it spoken of , but i did not know the details , and then no one can be more ignorant than i am of the affairs in the bourse . 30251m then you do not speculate ? i ? how could i speculate when i already have so much trouble in regulating my income ?: 49.59
<S> so much the better .: 8.38
<S> on ! they all set off , swift as the wind .: 41.58
<S> are you prepared ? yes , sir . you know that we shall fight till one of us is dead , said the general , whose teeth were clenched with rage .: 25.67
<S> let us then take advantage of it . then , aloud : well , my dear la ramee !: 17.64
<S> leave them , said monte cristo .: 11.10
<S> fortunately , the reader may remember , or may not remember fortunately we have promised not to lose sight of him .: 63.32
<S> he drew up for a minute , threw a rapid glance around him , and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket , where it began playing with a pistol .: 30.82
<S> we shall see the windows open , and the lady enter by escalade .: 48.97
<S> the window , let at an exorbitant price , which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests , was on the second floor of the great palace , situated between the via del babuino and the monte pincio .: 39.13
<S> ah , diable ! said the host to himself ; this man seems dumb .: 19.14
<S> ah , sir , said d artagnan , you have a wicked smile .: 8.47
<S> light me ; i am going to the queen . bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way .: 41.95
<S> why do you doubt ? the past that obscurity on the past . but that does not affect the son . very true . now , i beg of you , don t go off your head .: 38.88
<S> but the voyage was not ended .: 33.85
<S> nor was it from caprice we asked the question , for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the church .: 82.70
<S> and what do you believe ? his voice was stifled by sobs .: 16.48
<S> accept my compliments ; your dinner has been a real feast .: 55.31
<S> why don t we go in with them ? asked porthos .: 19.63
<S> god pardon me ! cried buckingham , i really think he threatens me ! no , my lord , i still plead .: 29.89
<S> the executioner made a sign , and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him .: 32.00
<S> a small vessel with an english crew , whose captain is on my side , awaits you at the mouth of charente , at fort la pointe .: 67.41
<S> only one minute , mr. felton , and you will have saved my honor ! to kill yourself ? cried felton , with terror , forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner , to kill yourself ? i have told , sir , murmured milady , lowering her voice , and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground ; i have told my secret !: 47.70
<S> it was to her he wrote from the siege of rochelle , to warn her of a plot against the duke of buckingham . exactly so ; will you allow me to speak to you of her ? if , replied the duchess , with a meaning look , you do not say too much against her . i should be ungrateful , said athos , and i regard ingratitude , not as a fault or a crime , but as a vice , which is much worse . you ungrateful to marie michon , monsieur ? said madame de chevreuse , trying to read in athos s eyes .: 38.40
<S> oh , no ; it is useless .: 10.55
<S> his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter .: 31.41
<S> prepare yourself , maximilian , he said with a smile ; we leave paris tomorrow . have you nothing more to do there ? asked morrel .: 23.21
<S> a man !: 26.81
<S> silence ! said d artagnan , taking her hand , which , without thinking of it , she abandoned to him .: 18.90
<S> special rules , set forth in the general terms of use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg electronic works to protect the project gutenberg concept and trademark .: 30.15
<S> here i am , said he .: 9.12
<S> i possess nearly 50,000 livres in right of my mother ; my grandfather and my grandmother , the marquis and marquise de saint me ran , will leave me as much , and m. noirtier evidently intends making me his heir .: 36.32
<S> the stranger met julie on the stairs ; she pretended to be descending , but in reality she was waiting for him .: 33.37
<S> i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden , and , on my honor , without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle danglars , i can not understand how any man can really love her . the fact is , maximilian , that i was there , and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison . no ; but tell me it is a question of simple curiosity , and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to mademoiselle danglars i dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say .: 39.56
<S> rise , said the count , your life is safe ; the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplices one is mad , the other dead .: 52.19
<S> i have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county , and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around . and porthos heaved another sigh .: 113.04
<S> i took the wrong angle , and have come out fifteen feet from where i intended .: 59.42
<S> the ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost , the water of the river looked black and deep .: 61.16
<S> monsieur is going to marry me , replied the hostess , between two gasps .: 34.10
<S> his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness , his perception brightened in a remarkable manner , his senses seemed to redouble their power , the horizon continued to expand ; but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms , and which he had seen before he slept , but a blue , transparent , unbounded horizon , with all the blue of the ocean , all the spangles of the sun , all the perfumes of the summer breeze ; then , in the midst of the songs of his sailors , songs so clear and sonorous , that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down , he saw the island of monte cristo , no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves , but as an oasis in the desert ; then , as his boat drew nearer , the songs became louder , for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven , as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither , or amphion , the enchanter , intended there to build a city .: 68.03
<S> if there are three , let yourself be slain , but save the king . be easy , said aramis ; i will take two poniards and give one to parry .: 44.99
<S> he meets albert de morcerf in italy it is to rescue him from the hands of the banditti ; he introduces himself to madame danglars it is that he may give her a royal present ; your step mother and her son pass before his door it is that his nubian may save them from destruction .: 63.96
<S> what must i do ? above all things be always on your guard .: 70.63
<S> in the name of heaven , duke , leave me , go !: 17.48
<S> his first remark on entering was : you know , sir , i do not speak french ? i know you do not like to converse in our language , replied the envoy .: 37.75
<S> de montbazon , and mme .: 26.31
<S> bonacieux , who waited for him , and who , with the same precautions and the same good luck , conducted him out of the louvre .: 26.95
<S> adieu . thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the things that belonged to him .: 60.79
<S> his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother , and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir ; then , without asking permission of anyone , he proceeded , in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices , to pull the corks out of all the bottles .: 58.10
<S> but do you happen to belong to him ? monsieur d artagnan , replied athos , is in the service ; he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority .: 24.89
<S> you , too , have been in england , sir ? he said , making a sign to the queen , who was evidently going to issue a severe order .: 22.76
<S> i was speaking of your father s past history .: 27.03
<S> it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices .: 46.90
<S> i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieur d herblay .: 32.23
<S> his grace the duke of buckingham will not set out for france .: 37.54
<S> why , it is indeed a true royal jewel , which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a denier .: 32.15
<S> in the bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers , and you have not an idea , my lord , how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort ; i am of monsieur de bassompierre s party .: 65.35
<S> now am i at liberty to retire ? said the general .: 24.80
<S> his hand , always wonderfully beautiful and strong , was set off by a ruffle of lace , like certain hands by titian and vandyck .: 58.33
<S> you are a worthy fellow ; and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the pharaon . is it possible you were so kind ? yes , indeed ; i had previously inquired of dante s what was his opinion of you , and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post , for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you . and what was his reply ? that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars , but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship s owners would have his preference also . the hypocrite ! murmured danglars .: 56.92
<S> the night was rapidly approaching ; and already , at the cry of moccoletti ! repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors , two or three stars began to burn among the crowd .: 68.23
<S> it was this idea that had brought dante s back to the circular rock .: 35.23
<S> remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored . withdraw , sir , said buckingham , or i will call my attendant , and have you placed in irons . you shall not call , said felton , throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver .: 50.25
<S> the company looked at each other in consternation .: 20.88
<S> if you know a prayer , say it for you are condemned , and you shall die . at these words , which left no hope , milady raised herself in all her pride , and wished to speak ; but her strength failed her .: 32.55
<S> but how is it that madame de villefort is not here ? poor , dear woman , said debray , she is no doubt occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals , or in making cosmetics for herself or friends .: 61.23
<S> but madame henrietta is a daughter of france and was entitled to the hospitality of france .: 29.05
<S> i would propose to you to stake planchet , but as that has already been done , the englishman would not , perhaps , be willing . decidedly , my dear athos , said d artagnan , i should like better not to risk anything . that s a pity , said athos , coolly .: 32.88
<S> the door opened , and a dim light reached dante s eyes through the coarse sack that covered him ; he saw two shadows approach his bed , a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand .: 38.57
<S> at any rate , tell me : there s more chance of fighting in paris , is there not ? in that respect , my dear friend , it s delightful .: 36.22
<S> the wife of athos chapter xxviii .: 21.80
<S> these are , doubtless , your family arms ?: 72.20
<S> due information was given to the authorities , and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same time .: 56.34
<S> come , murmured athos , if she is not proud of him , she must be hard to please . it was three o clock in the afternoon .: 18.57
<S> conversational .: 176.23
<S> the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs . a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced , as he learned these tidings .: 86.92
<S> who knows ?: 45.37
<S> you knew the poor lad , then ? continued caderousse .: 23.60
<S> die in peace ! i am lost ! murmured milady in english .: 51.44
<S> you will forgive me , sir , for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in mine .: 32.56
<S> well , then , believe me , athos , your mission is ended , and ended nobly ; return to france with us . friend , said athos , our resolution is irrevocable . then you have some other motive unknown to us ? athos smiled and d artagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover ; but to all these reasons athos contented himself by replying with a calm , sweet smile and aramis by nodding his head .: 54.24
<S> come , courage !: 22.52
<S> and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced ? by the countess s visiting the colosseum , as we did last night , by moonlight , and nearly alone . you were with her , then ? i was . and what did you say to her ? oh , we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument ! upon my word , cried albert , you must have been a very entertaining companion alone , or all but alone , with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum , and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead !: 54.59
<S> mordaunt , one of my secretaries , will remit this letter of introduction to his eminence , the cardinal mazarin , in paris .: 32.42
<S> before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned .: 40.72
<S> la chesnaye , go and see if by rummaging all my pockets you can find forty pistoles ; and if you can find them , bring them to me .: 39.08
<S> oh , no , he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart , tragedy weapons , i own , which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles , but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly . jealousy indicates affection . true ; but i am not jealous . he is . of whom ? of debray ? no , of you . of me ?: 114.43
<S> if i take you , you will be hung ! the young man did not wait to be told twice , but passing under the horse s head disappeared at the corner of the rue guenegaud .: 28.37
<S> your history is a terrible one , mr. mordaunt , and touches me keenly ; but happily for you , you serve an all powerful master ; he ought to aid you in your search ; we have so many means of gaining information . my lord , to a well bred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track ; he is certain to reach the other . but this relation you mentioned do you wish me to speak to him ? said mazarin , who was anxious to make a friend about cromwell s person .: 61.44
<S> god sends me this , and i hail it joyfully ! how strong and courageous you are ! said the fair , frail girl to her brunette companion .: 67.41
<S> to the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans .: 30.03
<S> five millions on five little scraps of paper ! it must be seen to be believed . you do not doubt it ? no ! you say so with an accent stay , you shall be convinced ; take my clerk to the bank , and you will see him leave it with an order on the treasury for the same sum . no , said monte cristo folding the five notes , most decidedly not ; the thing is so curious , i will make the experiment myself .: 53.43
<S> the english are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of charles and his adherents .: 113.60
<S> monsieur , if she has escaped , it is not my fault , i swear . what business had you , then , to go into the chamber of monsieur d artagnan , your neighbor , with whom you had a long conference during the day ? ah , yes , monsieur commissary ; yes , that is true , and i confess that i was in the wrong .: 20.24
<S> into what room did you take him ? into the blue drawing room , according to your excellency s orders . that s right ; now bring the alicante and some biscuits . baptistin left the room .: 56.64
<S> oh , no , said porthos , it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres !: 23.39
<S> merce de s , who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved edmond ! true ! said fernand .: 40.13
<S> since my brother s assassination in the streets of ni mes , i had never entered the town ; the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected , seeing that we would no longer come to him , was forced to come to us , and had established a branch to his inn , on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire , at the sign of the pont du gard .: 33.97
<S> we have the gates . the gates !: 45.86
<S> but we must be going . the two immediately started across country toward the road to paris , followed by mousqueton , who , after being too cold all night , at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm .: 41.75
<S> he gave porthos a second nudge of the knee and porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard .: 56.82
<S> this is the case , said d artagnan ; this is your brother , madeleine ; you don t know him perhaps , but i know him ; he has arrived from amsterdam .: 23.55
<S> four or five men are placed in ambuscade in the first room .: 35.65
<S> i spurred on and found myself in the enemy s ranks . and the prince was pleased with you ? he told me so , at least , sir , when he desired me to return to paris with monsieur de chatillon , who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken .: 35.59
<S> barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes .: 53.77
<S> i was present during his last moments .: 30.62
<S> he thought the carriage was about to stop there .: 20.40
<S> you say m. danglars dined here ? yes , with count cavalcanti , the marquis his father , madame danglars , m. and madame de villefort , charming people , m .: 48.05
<S> really , said athos to them , you are not men but children , to let a woman terrify you so !: 59.18
<S> a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock , two more forced out the bolts , and the broken door fell in .: 71.95
<S> capital , answered the mendicant .: 30.93
<S> just then a patrol rode up .: 57.07
<S> the notary looked at villefort .: 20.67
<S> oh , how he will thank you ! i hope so .: 22.35
<S> his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money , and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table .: 55.16
<S> monte cristo took albert into his study , and pointing to a seat , placed another for himself .: 36.22
<S> emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair , and was loud in his expressions of delight .: 51.52
<S> what the devil , my dear , do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger , and nobody observe it ?: 40.02
<S> my god , can you not remember her name ? yes , it was pronounced in my hearing once .: 37.23
<S> the petition finished , villefort read it aloud .: 78.64
<S> save the queen ! cried mazarin to the coadjutor .: 22.93
<S> he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it .: 33.55
<S> mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about , but he had with him a waxlight , to help him to explore his mysterious strong box .: 63.03
<S> jacopo will carry you to leghorn , where monsieur noirtier awaits his granddaughter , whom he wishes to bless before you lead her to the altar .: 62.97
<S> the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs , little by little , and under the pretense of much heat throw off the scotch plaid which covered him .: 121.04
<S> caderousse lingered for a moment , then taking leave of old dante s , he went downstairs to rejoin danglars , who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac .: 29.84
<S> but never mind , that will do capitally . d artagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire madeleine to come upstairs .: 53.87
<S> i ll manage it somehow , you will see . but , said d artagnan , now i think of it what is to prevent our beginning to night ? nothing at all , said groslow .: 37.65
<S> why watch me ? asked the duke uneasily .: 35.05
<S> long ago this mysterious colony quitted spain , and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day .: 135.76
<S> we will grow old together and talk of our companions . no ! replied d artagnan , deuce take it , the campaign is going to begin ; i wish to be there , i expect to get something by it . what do you expect to get ? why , i expect to be made marechal of france ! ha !: 37.88
<S> porthos and i will stay here . the friends obeyed .: 36.70
<S> all !: 56.14
<S> porthos is in picardy . then aloud : and he has taken his ancient name of vallon ? to which he adds that of bracieux , an estate which has been a barony , by my troth . so that porthos will be a baron . i don t doubt it .: 51.83
<S> let it be a million , said caderousse ; you can never have so much as i wish you . thank you , said the young man .: 17.31
<S> do i not hear a carriage in the courtyard ? she opened noirtier s door , ran to a window in the passage , and returned hastily .: 29.35
<S> then , if he persists , notwithstanding all this as that is , as i have said , the limit of my mission i shall have nothing to do but to pray god to work a miracle for the salvation of france .: 43.19
<S> they found the door ajar .: 25.46
<S> she wrote two lines , sealed the letter with her private seal , and gave it to mme .: 40.71
<S> two months and a half elapsed in these trips , and edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman ; he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast , and learned all the masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other .: 70.21
<S> those on the other side had followed their example , thus favoring the views of the four friends , who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber .: 77.90
<S> mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace ; but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet , trembling all over , locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers .: 51.95
<S> valentine , with her woman s instinct , guessed that morrel would be monte cristo s second , and from the young man s well known courage and his great affection for the count , she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him .: 36.04
<S> i depend on you to accompany me to the opera ; and if you can , bring cha teau renaud with you . beauchamp availed himself of albert s permission , and left him , promising to call for him at a quarter before eight .: 31.49
<S> for him , the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady .: 35.53
<S> what ? asked his lordship .: 20.44
<S> i was informed that i was prisoner until i paid the sum of 4,000 roman crowns about 24,000 francs .: 74.05
<S> one is that of edmond dante s , lost to me long , long since .: 78.95
<S> i am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is attached .: 55.45
<S> come ! said he .: 8.25
<S> he showed the more respect to this queen , deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers , as he felt some self reproach for his own want of heart and his avarice .: 83.69
<S> at two o clock the tennis balls began , according to grimaud s directions , to take the direction of the moat , much to the joy of la ramee , who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat ; and very soon balls were wanting , so many had gone over .: 59.31
<S> after a few minutes of silent embarrassment , athos spoke .: 48.06
<S> good , it is by my side !: 28.96
<S> i was rocked when an infant in the arms of old ocean , and on the bosom of the beautiful amphitrite ; i have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of the other ; i love the sea as a mistress , and pine if i do not often see her . let us go , count . to sea ? yes . you accept my proposal ? i do . well , viscount , there will be in my courtyard this evening a good travelling britzka , with four post horses , in which one may rest as in a bed .: 65.40
<S> yes , my lord , said the marshal , you have divined all that was possible to human genius . recall le plessis , bellievre , villequier and d erlac , said the prince , recall all the troops that are on this side of the lys .: 61.95
<S> the captain was only waiting for his passengers ; hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards hastings , where they were to disembark .: 76.08
<S> but , ere he entered his travelling carriage , albert , fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into , placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo , on which , beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf , he had written in pencil : 27 , rue du helder , on the 21 st may , half past ten a.m. chapter 39 .: 56.16
<S> as to the duc de bouillon , he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to paris in a litter ; but his place was well filled by the duc d elbeuf and his four sons , ranged around him like a staff .: 42.16
<S> however , in an hour i shall know all .: 25.24
<S> you were saying , sir said fernand , awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark .: 76.42
<S> but was it on her own account , or on account of another , that she exposed herself to such hazards ?: 57.65
<S> has he any friends ? then he added aloud , did he make any resistance ? no , sir , with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him ; he had no means of resistance . to whom did he give up his sword ? he did not give it up ; he broke it . he did well ; but instead of breaking it , he might have used it to still more advantage . there was a momentary pause .: 38.19
<S> you were not certain my child was dead , and you buried it ?: 46.93
<S> his prediction was nearly fulfilled , but in a very different way from that which de bassompierre supposed ; for after the death of richelieu everything went on , contrary to expectation , in the same way as before ; and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison .: 83.25
<S> everything was in order , laces , dresses , jewels , linen , money , all were arranged in the drawers , and the countess was carefully collecting the keys .: 54.45
<S> i did not think two sapphires of such a fine water existed .: 71.48
<S> a few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded .: 40.57
<S> ah , to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband , merce de s , and to lose that hope , which was the only stay of my existence ! at least it was not i who ever encouraged you in that hope , fernand , replied merce de s ; you can not reproach me with the slightest coquetry .: 41.95
<S> my senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities .: 97.50
<S> perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you , who are socialists , and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor , but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me , and which i will even say , generally occupies itself about me only to injure me ; and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem , and preserving a neutrality towards them , it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me . bravo , cried cha teau renaud ; you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism .: 77.00
<S> arras was encumbered with fugitives .: 161.73
<S> now , said aramis , we know how the matter stands .: 22.75
<S> madame bonacieux presented her cheek to him .: 34.06
<S> she had heard something said about supper .: 62.99
<S> a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence .: 102.99
<S> the same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward ; the flaming globe descended afresh , and i was completely alone .: 162.02
<S> i waited your orders , said d artagnan , crossing swords .: 29.39
<S> you will get yourself decapitated , my beautiful queen , and that would be a pity . you laugh . faintly .: 40.23
<S> that s well , monsieur de tre ville , said the cardinal ; pray let that napkin be sent to me .: 20.22
<S> gentlemen , said the queen , laughing , pray take up your abode in the chateau ; it is large , and there will be no want of room for you all ; but , as we never thought of coming here , i am informed that there are , in all , only three beds in the whole establishment , one for the king , one for me and one for the cardinal , muttered the prince .: 37.98
<S> come , fanny , we will put her to bed . m. d avrigny , who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with noirtier , expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done ; but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered .: 41.02
<S> jump then , monsieur pistache . but pistache , as at first , turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane .: 52.62
<S> summon bertuccio , said the count .: 31.47
<S> he was a berrichon , thirty five or forty years old , mild , peaceable , sleek , employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works , providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes , but excellent .: 103.52
<S> in fact , at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind .: 30.38
<S> i claim , then , the right to choose my opponent .: 57.27
<S> if he is a prince , he is wrong not to maintain his rank ; i do not like anyone to deny his origin . oh , you are a thorough democrat , said monte cristo , smiling .: 25.36
<S> these men are going to behead your father .: 31.36
<S> ah , he is one who fears neither god nor satan , they say , and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service . 20093m but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy , said franz .: 92.25
<S> take it from me then , and so long at least as i receive my income , you shall be paid yours . come , come ; i always said you were a fine fellow , and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you .: 56.06
<S> ten times , as i told you , he came to see dante s father , and offered to receive him in his own house ; and the night or two before his death , as i have already said , he left his purse on the mantelpiece , with which they paid the old man s debts , and buried him decently ; and so edmond s father died , as he had lived , without doing harm to anyone .: 39.17
<S> m. morrel was seated at his right hand , danglars at his left ; while , at a sign from edmond , the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable .: 53.96
<S> poor queen , already fallen !: 81.77
<S> my only fear is the chance of dante s being released .: 61.73
<S> bravo !: 16.42
<S> my dear porthos .: 22.74
<S> benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced .: 133.59
<S> a few minutes after twelve o clock bernouin knocked at the queen s bedroom door , having come by the cardinal s secret corridor .: 43.15
<S> porthos knocked with his hand .: 21.47
<S> franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket , and presented it to the man who had spoken to him .: 11.52
<S> here i am , your excellency , said peppino , with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him .: 22.79
<S> but as to what had been done by porthos and d artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau .: 38.16
<S> grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the lys .: 17.21
<S> no one must disturb us , he said ; i must speak freely to her , accuse myself , and say he approached the door , touched the crystal handle , which yielded to his hand .: 40.57
<S> at least i hope so , said the novice , with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise .: 18.92
<S> if i strike with the sword , or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom , for three years , i have been on terms of intimacy , i must , at least , know why i do so ; i must meet him with a heart at ease , and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life . well , said morcerf , impatiently , what does all this mean ? it means that i have just returned from yanina . from yanina ? yes . impossible ! here is my passport ; examine the visa geneva , milan , venice , trieste , delvino , yanina .: 49.88
<S> so then so then , pack up our luggage , planchet , and let us be off .: 52.27
<S> it must be ; it shall be . seizing a pen , he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk , and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will , made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil , clearly explaining the nature of his death .: 52.26
<S> the countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket , with a gesture of despair .: 48.22
<S> that devil , porthos , is a man of prodigious strength ; still , if athos joins us , well , we shall be three of us to laugh at aramis , that little coxcomb with his too good luck . at villars cotterets he wrote to the cardinal : my lord , i have already one man to offer to your eminence , and he is well worth twenty men .: 53.21
<S> that s a snare , said athos ; don t go , d artagnan . and yet , replied d artagnan , i think i recognize the writing . it may be counterfeit , said athos .: 18.32
<S> well , my friend , fortune is inconstant , as the chaplain of the regiment said .: 31.88
<S> water ! oh , poor woman , poor woman ! murmured athos , in a broken voice .: 28.45
<S> however , as he was a favorite with cucumetto , as he had for three years faithfully served him , and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down , he hoped the chief would have pity on him .: 36.61
<S> the young man obeyed , mounted on the table , and , divining the wishes of his companion , placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands .: 32.00
<S> the peak of monte cristo reddened by the burning sun , was seen against the azure sky .: 43.80
<S> at the same moment a violent crash was heard , and cries of distress .: 18.52
<S> the grass had grown very thickly there during the summer , and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it .: 112.60
<S> his person had undergone a change , analogous to the change in his dress ; his figure had grown rotund and , as it were , canonical .: 68.97
<S> courage , my friend , but above all , prudence , and think what you owe to the queen . to her and to you ! cried d artagnan .: 28.64
<S> yes , continued he , a charming woman , who entertained kind views toward our friend d artagnan , who , on his part , has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots , a week ago by trying to poison him , and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal . what !: 53.00
<S> i have given you the choice between america and tyburn , replied lord de winter .: 25.15
<S> if , on the contrary , it is a prisoner , the noise i make will alarm him , he will cease , and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep . edmond rose again , but this time his legs did not tremble , and his sight was clear ; he went to a corner of his dungeon , detached a stone , and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came .: 43.18
<S> you are the child of my captivity .: 28.99
<S> the committee was made up of liberals , several of whom came forward to shake hands with him . albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars , but gratitude mingled with his sorrow : he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked .: 82.39
<S> let out your prisoner .: 107.25
<S> there listen ! and at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder , while the livid lightning illumined the room , and the thunder , rolling away in the distance , seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode .: 54.47
<S> shall i help you , madame ? asked athos .: 13.44
<S> you sent for me ? he said to the prisoner .: 17.45
<S> i can not see ! help , help , my friends !: 29.12
<S> endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the equal of the ablest intriguers , he remained an honest man .: 99.57
<S> he waited silently , striving to pierce through the darkness .: 33.23
<S> how can you find out ? you shall see . gaetano consulted with his companions , and after five minutes discussion a man uvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about , they returned the way they had come , and in a few minutes the fire disappeared , hidden by an elevation of the land .: 56.62
<S> what comments must be made ; and if the fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared , how the fronde must triumph ! it is frightful , murmured mazarin .: 84.53
<S> i am lost , murmured the queen , lost ! for the cardinal knows all , and it is he who urges on the king , who as yet knows nothing but will soon know everything .: 60.40
<S> i am repulsed on all sides . what ! it is so indeed ; mademoiselle euge nie scarcely answers me , and mademoiselle d armilly , her confidant , does not speak to me at all . but the father has the greatest regard possible for you , said monte cristo .: 36.43
<S> here !: 17.55
<S> come , dress yourselves , gentlemen , dress yourselves . franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions example .: 54.34
<S> by her side i am spanish , but the family of morcerf is french , and , i have heard , one of the oldest of the south of france . yes , replied monte cristo these blazons prove that .: 31.63
<S> bravo , count , bravo ! it is frank , at least , said morrel .: 27.33
<S> the accident was set down to the account of robbers , who had stopped the chaise in the wood .: 51.69
<S> they now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night to reconstruct the barricades .: 68.59
<S> your majesty has given me the control of this business ; we had better wait and see what they want . monsieur d artagnan ! i will answer for everything . nothing is so catching as confidence .: 46.83
<S> the man of meung chapter xv .: 16.51
<S> athos looked at his watch .: 12.13
<S> it was of this detachment , sent as a vanguard , that our friend d artagnan formed a part .: 73.71
<S> bonacieux , where art thou ?: 78.12
<S> it is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe .: 49.67
<S> they belong to the regiment that was at lens , which the prince assigned to the cardinal . ah , monsieur , said d artagnan , as if to sum up in a word all that conversation , if only his eminence would relent and grant to monsieur de la fere our liberty . i wish it with all my heart , said comminges .: 40.31
<S> i never lose a note of this opera if i can avoid it ; the music of william tell is so sweet . chapter 89 .: 108.76
<S> you at last ? cried d artagnan .: 12.12
<S> what undertaking can have brought him to paris ?: 51.79
<S> have i discovered the truth ? he said ; but whether it be for recompense or punishment , i accept my fate .: 46.48
<S> but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed , and that all his faculties were completely destroyed ? yes , his bodily faculties , for he can neither move nor speak , nevertheless he thinks , acts , and wills in the manner i have described .: 64.77
<S> to dinner ? said d artagnan .: 15.65
<S> one thing , however , reassured him ; he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off , and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders .: 33.40
<S> come in , said monte cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion ; and immediately beauchamp appeared .: 29.17
<S> sir , said valentine , i will do all i can to live , for there are two beings who love me and will die if i die my grandfather and maximilian . i will watch over them as i have over you . well , sir , do as you will with me ; and then she added , in a low voice , oh , heavens , what will befall me ? whatever may happen , valentine , do not be alarmed ; though you suffer ; though you lose sight , hearing , consciousness , fear nothing ; though you should awake and be ignorant where you are , still do not fear ; even though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin .: 45.37
<S> fear , that relentless pursuer , clogged dante s efforts .: 144.79
<S> who employed you to assassinate me ? a woman whom i don t know , but who is called milady . but if you don t know this woman , how do you know her name ? my comrade knows her , and called her so .: 36.03
<S> explain yourself , count ! cried the queen , whose anxiety grew greater every moment .: 34.55
<S> ever since valentine s dowry had been mentioned , morrel had been silent and sad .: 49.10
<S> besides , continued he , in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speaking besides , who says that it will begin again ? it has returned , count , exclaimed morrel ; that is why i hastened to you . well , what do you wish me to do ?: 34.59
<S> athos pointed to the bastion .: 28.48
<S> as my grandfather used to say , i once reigned in paris !: 65.86
<S> the two doctors , therefore , entered the room alone .: 35.81
<S> he was compelled , then , after having swallowed the contents of his bottle , to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion , to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep , whether well or ill. d artagnan , be it remembered , was only twenty years old , and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon , even with the saddest hearts .: 71.95
<S> the young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread .: 53.20
<S> he feels that every man owes a tribute to his country ; some contribute their talents , others their industry ; these devote their blood , those their nightly labors , to the same cause .: 118.48
<S> danglars was engaged at that moment , presiding over a railroad committee .: 112.46
<S> for , added he , the future can not fail to mend ; i inevitably look for better times .: 111.59
<S> like all popular movements , the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable .: 123.87
<S> i bear the traces of our friendship three slits or slashes from your sword . well , if you should be restored to favor , don t forget me . on the honor of a rochefort ; but you must do the like for me . there s my hand , i promise . therefore , whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf i shall say it , and you ? i shall do the same . apropos , are we to speak of your friends also , athos , porthos , and aramis ?: 52.44
<S> debray will , perhaps , be obliged to go to the minister and besides albert looked at his tablets , it is the hour i told the count , 21st may , at half past ten ; and though i do not much rely upon his promise , i wish to be punctual .: 47.92
<S> come , answer freely . m. bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible .: 68.27
<S> now , do you want a horse , or will you go afoot ? afoot , my lord ; i have served always in the infantry .: 36.97
<S> it was precisely at this moment that m. de tre ville , on leaving the residence of the lieutenant criminel and the governor of fort l eve que without being able to find athos , arrived at the palace .: 23.50
<S> it is impossible it can be she , said he .: 24.45
<S> we say aramis , because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior .: 37.14
<S> what a fool i was , said he , not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself ! chapter 90 .: 38.17
<S> of all that passed in that sleep , or the time which glided away while it lasted , i have no remembrance .: 92.84
<S> milady passed her two arms round felton s neck , and let herself slip out of the window .: 35.16
<S> answer frankly . i ?: 69.93
<S> different in your fate from us , you will have a king without a minister , whom you may serve , love , respect .: 88.26
<S> during the five years of this seclusion , which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man , m. de beaufort , had he not affected to brave the cardinal , despise princes , and walk alone without adherents or disciples , would either have regained his liberty or made partisans .: 104.81
<S> one of the windows was broken , the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung , split in two , on its hinges .: 36.46
<S> as to king charles , the question must be viewed differently ; in receiving and aiding him , france will censure the acts of the english nation , and thus so essentially harm england , and especially the well being of the government , that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities . at this moment mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man .: 95.67
<S> poor lad !: 32.46
<S> oh , you do not know what is seventeen months in prison ! seventeen ages rather , especially to a man who , like me , had arrived at the summit of his ambition to a man , who , like me , was on the point of marrying a woman he adored , who saw an honorable career opened before him , and who loses all in an instant who sees his prospects destroyed , and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife , and whether his aged father be still living !: 60.84
<S> the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of half light , that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features , although his dress was easily made out .: 69.38
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface .: 43.30
<S> d artagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that position .: 65.83
<S> had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of . you are right , aramis , let us travel on . to describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible .: 60.58
<S> if you plunge a dagger into your flesh , if you insinuate a bullet into your brain , which the least shock disorders , then certainly , you will suffer pain , and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price . yes ; i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death , as well as in life ; the only thing is to understand it . you have spoken truly , maximilian ; according to the care we bestow upon it , death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse , or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body .: 83.74
<S> come , she added .: 17.85
<S> indeed , i expected it , for it is a family inheritance ; both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack .: 55.61
<S> this belonged to one of his friends at the cafe de paris , so that the innkeeper , picking it up after andrea had left , was convinced that he had let his horse to the count of maule on , 25 rue saint dominique , that being the name and address on the card .: 66.19
<S> chevalier , said the king , when the door was closed , i believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil intentions .: 30.82
<S> he could not be mistaken ; milady was in it .: 21.18
<S> he seemed scarcely five and thirty .: 63.10
<S> he fell back , almost fainting , in his chair .: 31.38
<S> no , madame ; the law has commanded , and when it commands it strikes .: 59.64
<S> i might have suspected he was poisoning us . and you see you would have been deceived . yes , doubtless . but believe me , that man has other projects .: 57.53
<S> no , replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever diviner .: 24.95
<S> oh , monsieur , i thank you with all my heart . adieu , count , said the abbe d herblay ; i return to my convent . adieu , abbe , said the coadjutor , i am to preach to morrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening . adieu , gentlemen , said the count ; i am going to sleep twenty four hours ; i am just falling down with fatigue . the three men saluted one another , whilst exchanging a last look .: 31.58
<S> employ them , if your check with regard to felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind . felton has not told him , said milady to herself .: 80.08
<S> it was , then , into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart , ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg , and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap , with that half smile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face .: 62.90
<S> considering the gravity of the occasion , i permit you to speak , my friend ; but be laconic , i beg .: 45.01
<S> and i also am to fight with this gentleman , said aramis , coming in his turn onto the place .: 24.50
<S> the white flag , morbleu ! we must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy , even if that flag be but a napkin . and athos ran back to the bastion , mounted the platform , and bore off the flag ; but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range , they opened a terrible fire upon this man , who appeared to expose himself for pleasure s sake .: 58.08
<S> like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up , and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop , so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dante s .: 164.89
<S> mademoiselle , said euge nie , let the porter get the post chaise from the coach house , and fetch some post horses from the hotel .: 51.55
<S> in the first place , said he , i wish my lackey placed with me , fully armed . we hastened to obey this order ; for you will please to understand , monsieur , we were disposed to do everything your friend could desire .: 46.59
<S> in the anteroom , valentine met barrois , and looked despairingly at the old servant .: 30.79
<S> now , sir , said d artagnan , wishing to change the conversation , here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier .: 21.72
<S> days and weeks passed away , then months dante s still waited ; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight .: 113.01
<S> come , porthos ; come , mousqueton . they all mounted the horses as quickly as possible .: 32.51
<S> while we can not and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate .: 122.13
<S> that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair , and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses .: 56.82
<S> a gentleman , in his opinion and according to d artagnan s portrait of him , the stranger must be a gentleman would be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter .: 41.97
<S> as to cocles , he seemed completely bewildered .: 23.99
<S> let us return to the object that brings me here . what , that which brings you home to me ?: 32.65
<S> we will return someday to pray over her grave . d artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of athos , and sobbed aloud .: 34.16
<S> he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth , which he saw at nearly half a league before him , standing out in the haze of the morning , with its houses and towers .: 40.59
<S> as to the horse , we can easily find some excuse for its disappearance .: 49.07
<S> well , asked the president , what is your decision ? 40206m i have no reply to make , said the count in a low tone .: 19.06
<S> in one case or the other , the trial was soon over .: 42.33
<S> therefore , after the connection had continued three years , carefully fostered by d artagnan , who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year , each doing credit to the other , the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to d artagnan that he should marry her .: 71.30
<S> but d artagnan at the same time , being a man of extreme caution , was quite aware what injury he should do himself , if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of athos .: 44.78
<S> aramis whistled for bazin , but bazin was asleep in the ante chamber , and aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him .: 35.88
<S> don t you see them ? cried friquet , don t you see ?: 17.82
<S> believe me , and take comfort , this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds , even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea , which we take for terra firma , and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them .: 86.10
<S> the prisoner whom you there see pale , agitated , and alarmed , instead of as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy going home to sup peacefully with his family , and then retiring to rest , that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow , is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner .: 125.62
<S> what is the use of one horse for us two ?: 29.60
<S> he has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him , and when he returned , took nothing but a glass of lemonade . ah , said madame de villefort , why did he not take wine ?: 37.94
<S> when i perceived you , i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs , which would have justified the proverb of he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself . well , on my word of honor , i answered , no ! i wished no ill to morcerf ; he was a little proud , perhaps , for a man who like myself has risen from nothing ; but we all have our faults .: 85.95
<S> come , hayde e , come ! and throwing his arm around the young girl s waist , he pressed the hand of valentine , and disappeared .: 20.29
<S> because all gentlemen are brothers , because you are a gentleman , because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen , because the blind populace , ungrateful and brutal , always takes pleasure in pulling down what is above them .: 107.50
<S> i yesterday took the place of another .: 57.65
<S> it was the queen !: 21.60
<S> a night is soon passed ; and tomorrow to the wheel , to the gallows !: 65.56
<S> therefore , when i cough , stretch out your arm . good ! the two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed , porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window .: 53.87
<S> yes . i am sure you are ; it is not very difficult to discover that . and the young girl smiled on her grandfather , as if he had been a child .: 15.87
<S> it is kept by a friend of ours . at last we have something definite , said athos ; let us go to the peacock . yes , answered aramis , but if we are to get there we must rest our horses , for they are almost broken winded . aramis was right ; they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine ; they gave them three hours rest and then set off again .: 56.21
<S> i once thought , continued faria , of removing these iron bars , and letting myself down from the window , which , as you see , is somewhat wider than yours , although i should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight ; however , i discovered that i should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court , and i therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger .: 77.62
<S> and whatever might be considering the violent character of milady the danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress , she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her .: 57.99
<S> if he troubles me too much i will crush him , the insect !: 85.23
<S> will there be any mass ? asked one of the attendants .: 37.42
<S> i charge him also with my blessing for my children and with the sentiments of my soul for yourself , my dearest sweetheart . the letter bore the signature , not of charles , king , but of charles still king . and let him be no longer king , cried the queen .: 88.07
<S> although weakened , the young man s brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners liberty !: 166.81
<S> franz took the letter , and read : tuesday evening , at seven o clock , descend from your carriage opposite the via dei pontefici , and follow the roman peasant who snatches your torch from you .: 49.66
<S> but now we must part .: 45.96
<S> how will the crown , which is scarce firmly set on the head of louis xiv. , support a double weight ? the weight was not so heavy when i was in peril , interrupted the queen , with a sad smile , and i ask no more for my husband than has been done for me ; you see that we are very humble monarchs , sir . oh , you , madame , the cardinal hastened to say , in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming , with regard to you , that is another thing .: 50.67
<S> what is it ? said the musketeers .: 9.08
<S> we started a stag of ten branches .: 107.87
<S> at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long ; now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them .: 85.91
<S> silence , said felton , i hear footsteps . we are discovered ! there was a silence of several seconds .: 51.57
<S> hold ; see !: 167.54
<S> how do you take it ? inquired the unknown ; in the french or turkish style , strong or weak , sugar or none , cool or boiling ?: 85.77
<S> have two riding horses ready .: 184.50
<S> dante s remained a prisoner , and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviii . s throne , or the still more tragic destruction of the empire .: 58.27
<S> ah , madame , he said , why did you not make that request of me ? with you , sir , replied the baroness , one can wish for nothing , one is so sure to obtain it .: 23.38
<S> thus all my opinions i will not say public , but private are confined to these three sentiments , i love my father , i respect m. morrel , and i adore merce de s .: 60.71
<S> i have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in london , and i say to you , live , sire , it is the will of heaven . the king raised himself , buckled on his belt , and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead , said : well , what is to be done ? sire , have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely ? winter , said the king , do you believe in the fidelity of yours ? sire , they are but men , and men are become both weak and wicked .: 39.55
<S> between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic , tomatoes , and eschalots ; while , lone and solitary , like a forgotten sentinel , a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot , and displayed its flexible stem and fan shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub tropical sun .: 111.65
<S> horses , nowadays , are not what they were formerly , observed porthos ; everything degenerates . i have sent grimaud to dammartin , said aramis .: 62.96
<S> now , if i had taken the veil , all this fortune would have descended to my father , and , in reversion , to his son . ah , how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious . it is not for herself that she is so , but for her son , and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love . but could you not compromise matters , and give up a portion of your fortune to her son ? how could i make such a proposition , especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested ? valentine , i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred ; consequently , i have covered it with the veil of respect , and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul .: 57.51
<S> if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments , a word , thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort , was the share athos furnished to the conversation .: 62.62
<S> porthos fancied they were mystifying him , and began to curl his mustache and knit his eyebrows ; but the knee of mme .: 57.04
<S> no other of the bandits would , perhaps , have done the same ; but they all understood what carlini had done .: 48.36
<S> but here is m. dandre himself ; and m. dandre , announced by the chamberlain in waiting , entered .: 72.17
<S> your excellency , he said , the master of the ho tel de londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the viscount of morcerf . a letter from the viscount ! exclaimed franz .: 19.71
<S> at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor , and , with many bows and courteous smiles , the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter .: 47.91
<S> it was for this i had annulled the lease it was for this i had come it was for this i was waiting .: 72.76
<S> i alone can save you , and i will . valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands , for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage , and began to pray , and while uttering little more than incoherent words , she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair , and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress .: 52.41
<S> as to his voice , prayers , sobs , and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness , and at others rough and almost hoarse .: 115.49
<S> if one s lot is cast among fools , it is necessary to study folly .: 91.77
<S> take care , for i warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my sword and my sword is long i rip him up . the chieftain of the party drew near .: 53.92
<S> a cloud passed over his brow as he said : no , monsieur , i do not know the writing , and yet it is tolerably plain .: 20.34
<S> i call to witness the god who hears us , that on the contrary i am a fervent catholic ! then , madame , said the abbess , smiling , be reassured ; the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison , and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity .: 43.47
<S> goodnight . and before dante s could open his mouth before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was , the jailer disappeared , taking with him the lamp and closing the door , leaving stamped upon the prisoner s mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon .: 70.98
<S> what is there more astonishing in all that i have said to you than in what you have told me ? no ; what i think astonishing is that you should expect my coming . and yet that is the most simple thing in the world , my dear sister .: 28.85
<S> i am hardly nineteen ; i know nothing ; i have no part to play .: 32.15
<S> paris is a horrible place in summer .: 58.41
<S> in the centre of this court , in the form of a horseshoe , were the buildings occupied by mazarin , and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building , where d artagnan was confined , and that , level with the orangery , where athos was to be .: 56.86
<S> if it were nothing but a sword thrust , why then i have counted upon you on this occasion , monsieur . yes ? seeing you constantly surrounded by musketeers of a very superb appearance , and knowing that these musketeers belong to monsieur de tre ville , and were consequently enemies of the cardinal , i thought that you and your friends , while rendering justice to your poor queen , would be pleased to play his eminence an ill turn . without doubt . and then i have thought that considering three months lodging , about which i have said nothing yes , yes ; you have already given me that reason , and i find it excellent . reckoning still further , that as long as you do me the honor to remain in my house i shall never speak to you about rent very kind ! and adding to this , if there be need of it , meaning to offer you fifty pistoles , if , against all probability , you should be short at the present moment . admirable !: 67.52
<S> our magnificence makes you smile , count , said maximilian , who had followed him with his eyes .: 23.93
<S> they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound .: 58.88
<S> his friend !: 39.47
<S> impossible ! cried milady .: 14.37
<S> it was purely and simply his removal , in terms clear and precise .: 194.22
<S> in which the plot thickens his visit to m. de tre ville being paid , the pensive d artagnan took the longest way homeward .: 63.76
<S> the cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance , yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said : you are monsieur d artagnan ? i am that individual , replied the officer .: 43.83
<S> the horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning ; only , by the count s orders , in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads , had been fastened a large diamond .: 54.26
<S> my dear athos , you view things on the dark side , methinks . my dear fellow , i mistrust women .: 66.43
<S> i have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful . what a cold wind ! resumed athos ; a wintry blast .: 93.81
<S> it might be a vengeance of milady ; that was most probable .: 42.11
<S> come , he said , stretching out his hand to d artagnan , come , don t be sullen , my dear son , for i have said all this to you , if not in the tone , at least with the feelings of a father .: 20.97
<S> both got into albert s coupe ; and , as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going , he called aloud , to the opera . in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance .: 54.48
<S> the bearer of this letter will tell you , madame , what i dare not trust to pen and paper and the risks of transit .: 74.75
<S> but as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the event that is to say , till two o clock in the afternoon two vessels had already left the port , the one bearing , as we know , milady , who , already anticipating the event , was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral s ship .: 57.67
<S> i will continue , then , resumed aramis .: 12.58
<S> all eyes were fixed on the door , which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity .: 23.11
<S> we need not say she stopped at the first floor .: 21.95
<S> because you are not feverish or delirious tonight , but thoroughly awake ; midnight is striking , which is the hour murderers choose . oh , heavens , exclaimed valentine , wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead .: 79.31
<S> upon my word you would make caesar afraid . the matter is , replied d artagnan , that i can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman . and you complain of that ! said porthos .: 57.45
<S> albert extended his hand .: 12.33
<S> what ?: 20.58
<S> parry , said the king , rising too , my horse ; i desire to go to thirsk . egad ! said d artagnan to athos , your king has thoroughly taken me , and i am quite at his service . if what you say is sincere , replied athos , he will never reach london . how so ? because before then we shall have carried him off . well , this time , athos , said d artagnan , upon my word , you are mad . have you some plan in your head then ? asked aramis .: 29.03
<S> he came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street .: 44.93
<S> i hate him !: 22.66
<S> i , pardieu ! and you would arrest him ? why not ? you would arrest the duc de beaufort , armed , in the field ? if your eminence should order me to arrest the devil , i would seize him by the horns and would bring him in . so would i , said porthos .: 42.26
<S> robert macaire is the hero of two favorite melodramas chien de montargis and chien d aubry and the name is applied to bold criminals as a term of derision .: 156.01
<S> if my brow be severe , it is because many misfortunes have clouded it ; if my heart be petrified , it is that it might sustain the blows it has received .: 73.08
<S> i am lost ! was his second thought ; and , indeed , for a man in andrea s situation , an arrest meant the assizes , trial , and death , death without mercy or delay .: 68.38
<S> here guitant spoke to one of the subalterns , asking how matters were progressing .: 107.36
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> the conversation between milady and the cavalier was so animated that d artagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty soubrette perceiving his presence .: 44.55
<S> the duke uttered a cry , but grimaud did not give a single moan .: 21.16
<S> in the court which we have attempted to describe , and from which a damp vapor was rising , a young man with his hands in his pockets , who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the den , might be seen walking .: 55.50
<S> porthos opened his mouth , thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn ; d artagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye .: 31.94
<S> there was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger ; and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of milady , which , however , immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose .: 42.75
<S> my friends , that s exactly like me !: 52.59
<S> in his projects of intrigue for the future , and determined as he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune , d artagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them .: 59.86
<S> mazarin started , turned toward the comte de la fere , and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance , took the pen .: 27.78
<S> merce de s read with terror the following lines : the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dante s , second in command on board the pharaon , this day arrived from smyrna , after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo , is the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper , and of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris .: 37.67
<S> what have you to do with politeness , i should like to know ?: 30.41
<S> do i , for instance , fare better ?: 63.09
<S> d artagnan searched his pockets , and took from one of them the order for the passage .: 34.30
<S> these are our arms , that is , those of my father , but they are , as you see , joined to another shield , which has gules , a silver tower , which are my mother s .: 51.19
<S> no , my friend , replied athos , in his gentle but decided voice , we came here to defend king charles ; we have but ill defended him it remains for us to save him ! to save the king ? said d artagnan , looking at aramis as he had looked at athos .: 42.47
<S> and a large sum ! said mazarin .: 28.57
<S> the soldier on guard at her door stopped , as if he had been changed into stone .: 40.83
<S> athos , who had not lost a word of the conversation , took his two companions by the hand , and led them to the other end of the room .: 14.09
<S> well , he of whom i speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand , of this atom ; he has purchased the title of count somewhere in tuscany . he is rich , then ? i believe so . but that ought to be visible . that is what deceives you , debray . i do not understand you . have you read the arabian nights ? what a question ! well , do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor , if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds ?: 56.91
<S> one of the two men , whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed , was an entire stranger to him , but not so the other ; and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features , from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow , the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them , hear them when or where he might .: 53.97
<S> the boat followed in the wake of the ship , a speck near the enormous mass .: 50.74
<S> the cavalcade trotted on more sharply .: 212.26
<S> and you , too , said he , come , if you like , monsieur ; you have a claim , being almost one of the family , and i will give as many rendezvous of that kind as i can find persons willing to accept them . cavalcanti looked at danglars with a stupefied air , and the latter , making an effort , arose and stepped between the two young men .: 32.24
<S> he returned to mousqueton , but the steward had sold the last wisp .: 57.75
<S> meanwhile , carried away as we are by our narrative , we must leave our three friends to themselves , and follow the duke of buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the louvre .: 50.06
<S> this awakening you have given me ; allow me , then , to enjoy it at my ease , and taking her hand , she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside .: 35.45
<S> madame de saint me ran had three successive attacks , at intervals of some minutes , each one more serious than the former .: 36.70
<S> i can not cry ; at my age they say that we have no more tears , still i think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping .: 52.44
<S> so they have picked up the word and the insurrectionists are called frondeurs , and yesterday every article sold was a la fronde ; bread a la fronde , hats a la fronde , to say nothing of gloves , pocket handkerchiefs , and fans ; but listen at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing : a tempest from the fronde did blow to day : i think twill blow sieur mazarin away . insolent wretch ! cried guitant .: 153.10
<S> read ? he said .: 25.57
<S> the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy ; in fact , he did not notice the offered hand .: 37.84
<S> there remained athos and d artagnan .: 17.15
<S> noirtier fixed his eyes on her .: 17.47
<S> mademoiselle danglars was still the same cold , beautiful , and satirical .: 42.91
<S> this , then , continued aramis , was my first opinion ; but as i am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which i profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment , but to ask the opinion of others , i have inquired eh ! my friend aramis paused .: 56.14
<S> their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the king s room , so as to form a kind of trap door .: 64.23
<S> he took the arm of madame danglars , and conducted her into the garden , where they found danglars taking coffee between the cavalcanti .: 35.41
<S> for a man who , like franz , viewed his position in its true light , it was a grave one .: 60.36
<S> when he had run over all these names in his memory , again read and studied them , commenting meanwhile upon his lists , he shook his head .: 66.20
<S> perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart .: 93.61
<S> he gave a ball every year , at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour only , that is to say , five and forty minutes less than the king is visible at his balls .: 49.18
<S> onward ! cried d artagnan , in a loud voice .: 8.53
<S> when he reached the wicket of the louvre , he turned to the left , galloped across the carrousel , passed through the rue saint roch , and , issuing from the rue de la michodie re , he arrived at m. danglars door just at the same time that villefort s landau , after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg saint honore , stopped to leave the baroness at her own house .: 30.74
<S> who went out this morning ? athos asked , uneasily .: 43.22
<S> i tell you what , m. franz , cried albert , you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now . and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert . well , then , hearken to me . i listen . you agree , do you not , that obtaining a carriage is out of the question ? i do . neither can we procure horses ? true ; we have offered any sum , but have failed . well , now , what do you say to a cart ?: 43.66
<S> and now , said athos , what is to be done ?: 9.05
<S> the name of one of the four friends is caderousse . the innkeeper shivered .: 41.43
<S> but it is a glorious day for me , continued the young girl , raising her ardent gaze to heaven , that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father ! the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time .: 29.04
<S> danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty .: 26.08
<S> your age ? said the president ; will you answer that question ? i will answer that question , as well as the rest , mr. president , but in its turn . your age ? repeated the president .: 29.73
<S> the prince awaited him there .: 40.46
<S> as to what may lie before us , it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought .: 76.31
<S> and why were you so affected at that story , or rather fable , which the count related ? because i have been in such shocking spirits all the evening , my friend , said the baroness .: 44.34
<S> bonacieux the one he had just picked up .: 53.44
<S> the count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon , and offered it to morrel , fixing a long steadfast glance upon him .: 40.24
<S> the marchioness raised her head at this word , and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply regretted child , who still lived for her in valentine , she felt touched at the name of mother , and bursting into tears , she fell on her knees before an armchair , where she buried her venerable head .: 51.55
<S> if he demands my daughter let him fix the day declare his conditions ; in short , let us either understand each other , or quarrel .: 90.57
<S> the baron entered slowly , sending a scrutinizing glance from milady to the young officer .: 33.66
<S> monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened ; his face was like marble , and his heart was like bronze .: 33.21
<S> i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf , so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little , we might meet in the same drawing rooms . come , your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light . that is all very fine , benedetto mio , but i know what i am saying .: 52.18
<S> then , raising him up as tobit raised the fish by the gills , you must pull him into the room , taking care to squeeze him so tight that he can t cry out . oh ! said porthos .: 57.94
<S> athos as a diplomatist .: 34.18
<S> he attacked this wall , cemented by the hand of time , with his pickaxe .: 38.31
<S> the tower of st. jacques de la boucherie .: 12.08
<S> guiche summoned one of his grooms , and delivering the prisoner into his charge , with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape , he leaped from his horse and approached raoul .: 61.77
<S> as i had expected , i found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand marshal ; but i sent the ring i had received from the captain to him , and was instantly admitted .: 46.68
<S> planchet called his master s attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey , and only preceded them by about fifty paces .: 39.32
<S> there s only the price we are not agreed about . how not agreed about ? said caderousse .: 74.30
<S> how kind you are , exclaimed the young man , pressing his guardian s hand ; and i can set out immediately ? when you like , raoul . sir , said raoul , as he turned to leave the room , i have thought of one thing , and that is about the duchess of chevreuse , who was so kind to me and to whom i owe my introduction to the prince . and you ought to thank her , raoul .: 29.24
<S> but if he annoys you , this young fool to be sure he does .: 50.07
<S> confiteor ! said caderousse , putting the diamond on his little finger ; i was mistaken ; but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller s shop it is another branch of industry paralyzed . have you finished ? said andrea , do you want anything more ? will you have my waistcoat or my hat ?: 75.47
<S> the dying man had signed a deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin .: 104.91
<S> in fact , m. bonacieux , having left his house at seven o clock in the evening to go to the louvre , never appeared again in the rue des fossoyeurs ; the opinion of those who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle , at the expense of his generous eminence .: 31.28
<S> it may be worn at via reggio ; but that costume , however elegant in itself , has long been out of fashion in paris . that s unfortunate . oh , if you really are attached to your old mode of dress ; you can easily resume it when you leave paris . but what shall i wear ? what you find in your trunks . in my trunks ?: 67.59
<S> the doctor left him in this paroxysm , knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it , and , going up to noirtier , said abruptly : how do you find yourself ? well ? yes . have you any weight on the chest ; or does your stomach feel light and comfortable eh ? yes . then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which i am accustomed to give you every sunday ? yes . did barrois make your lemonade ? yes . was it you who asked him to drink some of it ? no . was it m. de villefort ? no . madame ? no . it was your granddaughter , then , was it not ? yes . a groan from barrois , accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very jawbones , attracted the attention of m. d avrigny ; he left m. noirtier , and returned to the sick man .: 51.97
<S> the queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies .: 32.72
<S> what a misfortune it is you did not follow your first vocation ; what a delicious abbe you would have made ! oh , it s only a temporary postponement , replied aramis ; i shall be one someday .: 54.99
<S> it is i mousqueton , said a mournful voice , whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the road .: 42.95
<S> in fact , of the twenty rose trees which formed the parterre , not one bore the mark of the slug , nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil .: 112.06
<S> everyone spoke , harangued , and vociferated , swearing , cursing , and consigning the cardinal and his guards to all the devils .: 82.29
<S> he turned around and mordaunt stood before him .: 23.67
<S> signor pastrini informed them that business had called him to civita vecchia .: 94.20
<S> he had entered the service of porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged , though in a handsome manner ; but he claimed two hours a day to himself , consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other wants .: 76.28
<S> the abbe did not know the island of monte cristo ; but dante s knew it , and had often passed it , situated twenty five miles from pianosa , between corsica and the island of elba , and had once touched there .: 33.68
<S> planchet and bazin came last .: 65.85
<S> then it appeared to him that monte cristo smiled , not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart , but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child .: 33.32
<S> albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required , and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day .: 63.62
<S> i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france .: 56.57
<S> fortunately , as we have said , edmond was only wounded , and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons , and sold to the smugglers by the old sardinian women , the wound soon closed .: 58.72
<S> do you not , father ? yes , resolutely replied noirtier .: 28.34
<S> wretch ! exclaimed aramis , raising his pistol as he passed by him ; but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off .: 37.04
<S> i can not see .: 16.55
<S> well ! said d artagnan .: 4.96
<S> oh , growl as much as you please , cried lord de winter , but don t try to bite , for i warn you that it would be to your disadvantage .: 21.92
<S> already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de morcerf , it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly listened to , and fully credited , all the additional circumstances detailed by debray .: 120.69
<S> let them come in , cried the young princess , bounding to the door .: 17.86
<S> mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to m. de saint me ran ; and m. de saint me ran is dead .: 25.78
<S> ugh !: 87.23
<S> yes , it is i , my uncle i , the son of milady i , the monk i , the secretary and friend of cromwell i know you now , both you and your companions . in that boat sat three men , unquestionably brave , whose courage no man would have dared dispute ; nevertheless , at that voice , that accent and those gestures , they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins .: 82.76
<S> are you indisposed , or have you forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of mme .: 55.81
<S> the third , then , fell from the clouds , i suppose ? no , the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery , who would not tell me in whose service he was , and who said he had received orders from his master . or his mistress , interrupted d artagnan .: 43.82
<S> the frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us , promising at the same time to obtain the queen s consent to it . i can answer only for myself , said mazarin .: 43.35
<S> yes ; yours your own property . sir , my right hand correspondent is signalling . let him signal . sir , you have distracted me ; i shall be fined . that will cost you a hundred francs ; you see it is your interest to take my bank notes . sir , my right hand correspondent redoubles his signals ; he is impatient . never mind take these ; and the count placed the packet in the man s hands .: 55.59
<S> oh , yes , said she , smiling , but we won t tell him ! in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper .: 24.70
<S> d artagnan had not been deceived ; these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him , hoping that the young man s death would be placed to the account of the enemy .: 24.60
<S> madame de villefort has nothing of her own , and hates me for being so richly endowed .: 46.30
<S> it was in the rue des france bourgeois , close to la force .: 44.27
<S> oh , m. d avrigny , i beseech you , do something for her ! where is she ? in her room with the notary . and m. noirtier ? just as he was , his mind perfectly clear , but the same incapability of moving or speaking . and the same love for you eh , my dear child ? yes , said valentine , he was very fond of me . who does not love you ? valentine smiled sadly .: 38.64
<S> he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king ; and as the wound is very serious , seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest , it is to be feared at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head , but frightfully pale , appeared under the fringe .: 63.47
<S> do not fancy that i do you a favor ; i use either hand easily .: 153.00
<S> think what a solemn engagement you are making ; one has offered a wealthy shopkeeper , the other a count ; you are going , then , to offer a prince , are you ? i offer you a beggar , my lord . ah !: 49.69
<S> i will aid you in many ways , but without attaching you to my person .: 48.68
<S> his mother , the councillor s old servant , opened it .: 39.84
<S> we were speaking of a suitable habitation for the count of monte cristo .: 22.17
<S> the first who advances is a dead man ! cried raoul , for it was in fact he , who , feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen , pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling back .: 79.38
<S> the president rose , appointed three members to accompany him , and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes .: 56.85
<S> what is it ? said monte cristo .: 4.99
<S> all this is very strange ; and i am curious to know how it will end . badly , monsieur , badly ! replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet ; for , soliloquizing aloud , as very preoccupied people do , he had entered the alley , at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber .: 39.24
<S> tell me , i beseech you , what ails you ? cried dante s , letting his chisel fall to the floor .: 18.93
<S> perhaps so .: 109.69
<S> the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes ; undid the order of the saint esprit which he wore , to honor the two frenchmen who were with him , and passed it around winter s neck , who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereign s confidence and friendship .: 54.24
<S> the priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master , or rather , the mistress , replied : thank you , monsieur le cure , i accept . sup , then , and make as little noise as possible , said the priest , for i , too , have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep to night . madame de chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment , and from astonishment to stupefaction .: 55.56
<S> thus armed , the count held the lives of five men in his hands .: 45.41
<S> she appeared much dejected ; and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes .: 79.14
<S> as we have seen , therefore , he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition , but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity .: 103.52
<S> you have spared me , yet of all those who have fallen under your vengeance i was the most guilty .: 43.66
<S> well ; i shall rent a room in some respectable house , wear a decent coat , shave every day , and go and read the papers in a cafe .: 101.80
<S> a lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest .: 44.82
<S> then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts ; these were the counterscarps and bastions of athos , which the besieged himself demolished .: 75.00
<S> oh , said julie , pressing the purse to her heart , no , no , i beseech you do not take it , for some unhappy day you will leave us , will you not ? you have guessed rightly , madame , replied monte cristo , smiling ; in a week i shall have left this country , where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily , while my father perished of hunger and grief . while announcing his departure , the count fixed his eyes on morrel , and remarked that the words , i shall have left this country , had failed to rouse him from his lethargy .: 29.30
<S> i was mistaken , said the host , he s not quite dumb .: 21.94
<S> he heard me patiently , and when i had finished , burst out laughing .: 43.44
<S> my father ! cried the young girl , out of breath , and half dead with joy saved , you are saved ! and she threw herself into his arms , holding in her extended hand a red , netted silk purse .: 39.40
<S> why should i ? but still there are some signals only addressed to you . certainly . and do you understand them ? they are always the same . and they mean nothing new ; you have an hour ; or tomorrow . this is simple enough , said the count ; but look , is not your correspondent putting itself in motion ? ah , yes ; thank you , sir . and what is it saying anything you understand ? yes ; it asks if i am ready . and you reply ? by the same sign , which , at the same time , tells my right hand correspondent that i am ready , while it gives notice to my left hand correspondent to prepare in his turn . it is very ingenious , said the count .: 37.30
<S> porthos , as we have seen , had a character exactly opposite to that of athos .: 39.57
<S> the englishman is overflowing with pistoles .: 54.56
<S> approach him , said she , and when the next waiter passes , insist upon his taking something . but why , mother ? just to please me , albert , said merce de s .: 56.02
<S> having gained his room he raised his hand to his face , and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch s blood , fell down insensible .: 40.15
<S> cha teau renaud and morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder .: 70.53
<S> your turn , my lord , said athos .: 12.19
<S> now through this ventilating hole i throw my lasso , and as i now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine , that s my point for sport .: 73.85
<S> the whole of the property , consisting of an immense workshop , two pavilions at the bottom of the garden , and the garden itself , had been purchased by emmanuel , who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation .: 31.64
<S> yes ; i received the news this evening by a courier .: 48.07
<S> if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase project gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work , you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.e.1 through 1.e.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the project gutenberg trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.e.8 or 1.e.9 .: 14.92
<S> athos lend me grimaud , who in the society of his friend parry has perhaps picked up a little english , and can act as my interpreter . go , grimaud , said athos .: 64.60
<S> the devil take this gout ! cried monsieur de bouillon , evidently ill at ease .: 28.92
<S> what shall we do ? yes . why , the same we had intended doing three days since set off . what ? although you are not now going to be married , you intend still listen , louise .: 58.97
<S> we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance .: 84.24
<S> he fancied himself a burden to the society , forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for a month ; and he set his mind actively to work .: 103.44
<S> oh , then , you were glad to hear that m. morrel i didn t dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor ? he signified assent ; only think of the poor old man s being so pleased to think that you , who were a perfect stranger to him , had been made an officer of the legion of honor !: 38.65
<S> conde himself , whilst fighting for him , lost no opportunity of ridiculing , of humbling him .: 131.90
<S> one alone is left to me , but he is one of those known , i believe , to the cavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to speak . very good , said the queen ; you and your friend are worth an army . what am i to do , madame ? return at five o clock and i will tell you ; but do not breathe to a living soul , sir , the rendezvous which i give you . no , madame . swear it upon the cross . madame , i have never been false to my word ; when i say i will not do a thing , i mean it . the queen , although astonished at this language , to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers , argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which d artagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her project .: 41.67
<S> and have those who have lost their lives lost nothing ? m .: 57.67
<S> you have an order signed by the cardinal ? said the governor .: 19.50
<S> all at once he started .: 21.67
<S> her face is very pale , and i have listened in vain ; i do not hear her breathe . you are right , said felton , after having looked at milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her .: 29.43
<S> i am so unhappy . i have known a man much more unfortunate than you , morrel . impossible ! alas , said monte cristo , it is the infirmity of our nature always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides ! what can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and desired in the world ? listen , morrel , and pay attention to what i am about to tell you .: 49.69
<S> at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle .: 40.05
<S> a florentine adventurer , sire , and that was all ; while the august spouse of your majesty is anne of austria , queen of france that is to say , one of the greatest princesses in the world . she is not the less guilty , monsieur duke !: 32.51
<S> i am saved ! murmured he .: 18.18
<S> my friend , my father , said morrel with excitement , have a care , i again repeat , for the power you wield over me alarms me .: 51.37
<S> dante s closely and eagerly examined it ; he found it firm , solid , and compact enough to bear any weight .: 63.33
<S> men are so made ; and we are not always twenty years old .: 42.32
<S> with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative .: 186.64
<S> at last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused , as if he had partially appeased his hunger .: 33.54
<S> why , if you ever make use of the details i am about to give you , that you will never let anyone know that it was i who supplied them ; for the persons of whom i am about to talk are rich and powerful , and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me , i should break to pieces like glass . make yourself easy , my friend , replied the abbe .: 29.09
<S> you see it is a serious annoyance , said morcerf , when beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph .: 27.94
<S> pardieu ! if we may believe the signs grimaud is making , we are about to have to do with a very different number of people .: 49.12
<S> the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn .: 30.16
<S> who is this creature ? grimaud did not answer , but bowed a second time .: 25.32
<S> in the commandments of god , or of the church , i don t know which .: 34.21
<S> vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of madame de villefort , with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment , of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure .: 61.82
<S> when the lady of the red cushion came close to porthos , porthos drew his dripping hand from the font .: 51.30
<S> the procurator s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine horse .: 45.90
<S> groslow is on guard there this evening , and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him company . all four of us ? asked athos .: 44.06
<S> he has been beaten .: 24.75
<S> did you ever hear of such an idea ? monte cristo closed his eyes , and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas , yet moist with the cold dews of death , had touched his face .: 33.77
<S> bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things , gilded , perfumed , appetizing , that d artagnan was quite overcome .: 73.66
<S> d artagnan seized the hand held out to him , and kissed it ardently .: 25.69
<S> i heard you cry out , without understanding what you said .: 31.31
<S> as soon as this organization was established , they set about driving the english from the isle .: 51.27
<S> danglars did not even look at her , though she did her best to faint .: 41.83
<S> i was chosen .: 38.56
<S> grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth , pronounced this one word , pointed . true , said la ramee .: 62.77
<S> your address at paris ? ho tel of the guards , company of dessessart . enough , replied the questioner .: 64.45
<S> follow me , then , said the abbe , as he re entered the subterranean passage , in which he soon disappeared , followed by dante s .: 19.52
<S> you , the comte de la fere , on the side of broussel , blancmesnil and viole !: 20.80
<S> sign , my lord ; sign the liberation of milady de winter , said felton , holding out a paper to the duke .: 36.14
<S> he raised him , almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture , at the risk of flaying him in the passage .: 34.79
<S> he was a man of small stature , with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age .: 85.47
<S> at the expiration of a minute or two , it appeared to d artagnan that m. dessessart made him a sign to approach .: 20.24
<S> first , my lord ? inquired grimaud .: 23.46
<S> danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his word .: 59.97
<S> well , my dear viscount , said monte cristo , i have an infallible remedy to propose to you . what is that ? asked the young man .: 7.73
<S> this can t last , and he drew another twenty from his pocket .: 50.04
<S> go to him with this letter , and make him your model in order that you may do as he has done . upon which m. d artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son , kissed him tenderly on both cheeks , and gave him his benediction .: 48.54
<S> her mouth was small and rosy ; and although her underlip , like that of all princes of the house of austria , protruded slightly beyond the other , it was eminently lovely in its smile , but as profoundly disdainful in its contempt .: 80.41
<S> but in that same banker s study , where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs i give you monthly for pocket money , you must know , my dear young lady , that many things may be learned , useful even to a girl who will not marry .: 69.57
<S> draw nearer , penelon , said the young man , and tell us all about it . an old seaman , bronzed by the tropical sun , advanced , twirling the remains of a hat between his hands .: 39.52
<S> truly , said monte cristo , with your post horses going at the rate of two leagues an hour , and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another without permission , so that an invalid or ill tempered traveller may detain those who are well and active , it is impossible to move ; i escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and horses ; do i not , ali ? the count put his head out of the window and whistled , and the horses appeared to fly .: 79.84
<S> we dispense with your saying grace . grimaud silently swallowed the glass of bordeaux wine ; but his eyes , raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation , spoke a language which , though mute , was not the less expressive .: 107.36
<S> the contract chapter 97 .: 27.70
<S> it seemed like the fe te of jack o lanterns .: 100.90
<S> the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice , every blow seeming to dante s as if struck on his heart .: 57.26
<S> could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants with assaf tida , and the chinese eat swallows nests ?: 166.24
<S> and is the reason known ? no . how extraordinary !: 39.74
<S> luigi threw his cloak on the ground , placed his carbine on his shoulder , and freed from his heavy covering , preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer , which a horse can scarcely keep up with .: 57.96
<S> their horses were fed , but not unsaddled ; the grooms supped , for it was already late , and their two masters , impatient to return , appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any one .: 68.49
<S> come , continued athos , executioner , do your duty . willingly , monseigneur , said the executioner ; for as i am a good catholic , i firmly believe i am acting justly in performing my functions on this woman . that s well . athos made a step toward milady .: 43.28
<S> franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper ; and he saw the little yacht , now like a sea gull on the wave , continuing her flight towards corsica .: 45.54
<S> well , dante s , you do not thank me ? this treasure belongs to you , my dear friend , replied dante s , and to you only .: 19.98
<S> in that case , replied the major , it would be necessary to write to the cure for duplicates , and it would be some time before they could be obtained . it would be a difficult matter to arrange , said monte cristo .: 22.63
<S> the executioner walked behind them , and lord de winter , d artagnan , porthos , and aramis walked behind the executioner .: 19.67
<S> bonacieux and the duke entered the louvre without difficulty .: 44.49
<S> the englishman , with the coolness of his nation , addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles .: 61.92
<S> but the words you have just spoken , the hope you have almost given me , will have richly paid all were it my life . oh , but i , said anne , i also , duke , have had presentiments ; i also have had dreams .: 60.22
<S> this man was the executioner .: 21.07
<S> does this man know your majesty personally ? inquired aramis .: 43.29
<S> he then thought , with a touch of vexation , that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him .: 29.84
<S> the moment she lost sight of him , milady tumbled fainting into her chamber .: 39.29
<S> do not be intimidated .: 53.70
<S> also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation , and wishes to provide for the future .: 93.21
<S> he did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch ; only he represented his action as one of simple vengeance .: 62.55
<S> we who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the place royale . yes , yes , but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it .: 78.12
<S> aramis ! he cried .: 10.13
<S> besides , had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his father s name before hayde e ?: 45.74
<S> i can take you on my shoulders , and swim for both of us . my son , said the abbe , you , who are a sailor and a swimmer , must know as well as i do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes .: 53.94
<S> we can not say how long the night seemed to milady , but d artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds , and invaded the chamber with its paleness .: 52.79
<S> well , continued the cardinal , in an indifferent tone , the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman , handsome , young , and clever , who has cause of quarrel with the duke .: 41.15
<S> has the gascon been indiscreet ? she murmured to herself , then said aloud : d artagnan !: 42.42
<S> but there is the cardinal always at hand , who does not leave me a moment s repose ; who talks to me about spain , who talks to me about austria , who talks to me about england !: 63.73
<S> come , sir . wait , said monte cristo , i wish to take one final glance around this room . this is fortunate , said the guide ; i have forgotten the other key . go and fetch it . i will leave you the torch , sir . no , take it away ; i can see in the dark . why , you are like no .: 29.28
<S> whose is that letter of your mistress ?: 114.10
<S> now , the portmanteau let us make haste the portmanteau ! stop ! said louise , going to listen at madame danglars door .: 60.85
<S> what do you mean ? other men may have entered before them and waited for them . we can find out , said grimaud .: 29.46
<S> the door opened , and the man in the mantle reappeared .: 12.24
<S> two hours passed thus , during which i imagined i heard moans repeatedly .: 60.98
<S> that is rather difficult , but the merit in all things consists in the difficulty .: 72.99
<S> but , tell me , said andrea , am i to remain bareheaded ? pooh , said caderousse ; it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off . come , come ; enough of this , said cavalcanti .: 36.90
<S> villefort continued : he knows me , and i have pledged my word to him .: 24.83
<S> here is night coming on ; by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat , and nobody can guess where we are .: 58.35
<S> very droll , he muttered , very droll indeed , and he again began to carve the fowl , when peppino stopped the baron s right hand with his left , and held out his other hand .: 52.29
<S> the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened .: 74.78
<S> i don t like people to quiz me ! sir , said the young man , do you not come from paris , if you please ? d artagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital .: 28.59
<S> in the name of heaven , explain yourself . that i may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables ; that i may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my persecutor ?: 50.89
<S> when shall we land in england ? he asked ; but de winter seemed not to hear his words and made no reply .: 34.62
<S> although m. de villefort flattered himself that , to all outward view , he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind , he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow , so much so that the count , whose smile was radiant , immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air .: 48.54
<S> excellency , cried the cicerone , seeing franz approach the window , shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace ? accustomed as franz was to the italian phraseology , his first impulse was to look round him , but these words were addressed to him .: 53.15
<S> now , then , said cucumetto , advancing towards the other bandits , are you coming ? i follow you . 20111m cucumetto departed , without losing sight of carlini , for , doubtless , he feared lest he should strike him unawares ; but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carlini s part .: 46.76
<S> and yet , he said , i must admit that i sent for you to appoint you to quiet service ; i have certain apprehensions well , what is the meaning of that ? in fact , a great noise was heard in the ante chamber ; at the same time the door of the study was burst open and a man , covered with dust , rushed into it , exclaiming : my lord the cardinal !: 27.90
<S> what can you expect , athos ?: 15.78
<S> and your business is that of a confectioner , in the rue des lombards . explain to me how it happens that , following so peaceful a business , you had such warlike inclinations . why does my lord , belonging to the church , now receive me in the dress of an officer , with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots ? not badly answered , i faith , said gondy , laughing ; but i have , you must know , always had , in spite of my bands , warlike inclinations . well , my lord , before i became a confectioner i myself was three years sergeant in the piedmontese regiment , and before i became sergeant i was for eighteen months the servant of monsieur d artagnan . the lieutenant of musketeers ? asked gondy .: 63.12
<S> they fire like grooms , said porthos .: 63.89
<S> yes , continued the cardinal .: 7.41
<S> yes , madame ; and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds . as he ceased speaking , the count felt the hand of merce de s tremble .: 29.63
<S> let us sail before the wind , and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to calais or boulogne .: 54.18
<S> so much the better ; but that it may prove laughter worthy even to the end , let us not lose time . and he jumped off the wall .: 45.65
<S> a gendarme was crossing the court .: 50.70
<S> now , continued aramis , as the ladies did not see the singer come back , and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body , it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus ; and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time .: 53.89
<S> do you agree with aramis ? not at all , said d artagnan ; i am precisely of the contrary opinion . what !: 30.55
<S> they waited upwards of ten minutes .: 72.48
<S> valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction .: 48.77
<S> nothing was yet to be seen , only they heard the galloping draw nearer .: 61.31
<S> oh , my god , my god !: 4.70
<S> it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden , consisting of a small plot of ground , on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests .: 83.83
<S> and i must take care of it for him , since i only lend him my name . and raoul what shall you do with him ? i leave him with you , my friend .: 25.92
<S> as i rode by the count s house i perceived a light in one of the windows , and fancied i saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain .: 40.08
<S> who art thou ? cried he , clasping his hands .: 16.39
<S> besides do you see that door , athos ? yes ; what then ? well , you can go out by that door whenever you please ; for from this moment you are free as the air . i recognize you there , my brave d artagnan , replied athos ; but you are no longer our masters .: 36.80
<S> the same evening the grocer or grocers , druggist or druggists , come and say , it was i who sold the arsenic to the gentleman ; and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser , they will recognize twenty .: 116.61
<S> have you not heard that some one is coming here ? yes . well , that some one will open the doors . but , my dear fellow , if that some one recognizes us , if that some one cries out , we are lost ; for you don t propose , i imagine , that i shall kill that man of the church .: 39.01
<S> athos never received any letters ; athos never had concerns which all his friends did not know .: 126.11
<S> hayde e saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors ; she continued : when my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier .: 75.76
<S> d artagnan , in order that there might be no time lost , had saddled his horse himself .: 32.10
<S> had his , and these two powerful rivals vied with each other in procuring , not only from all the provinces of france , but even from all foreign states , the most celebrated swordsmen .: 73.78
<S> while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina , which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces , franz s attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace , for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant .: 56.89
<S> then tell the men to be in readiness don t tell them why now .: 85.63
<S> at this movement mordaunt turned around , recognized them , and uttered an exclamation of savage delight .: 40.61
<S> tony carries our muskets . then we set sail to night ? asked aramis , glancing toward the west , where the sun had left a single golden cloud , which , dipping into the ocean , appeared by degrees to be extinguished .: 60.46
<S> nay , do not press my hand , edmond ; you are thinking , i am sure , of some kind speech to console me , but do not utter it to me , reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness .: 50.25
<S> on leaving paris , athos and aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger ; but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger .: 77.78
<S> we must understand each other , said the duke .: 13.10
<S> well , and what then ? said fernand , lifting up his head , and looking at caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger ; merce de s is not accountable to any person , is she ?: 48.37
<S> wait a moment , sir , said he ; i have an order for each of you also . he turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up , and took out two ribbons of the order of the garter .: 30.78
<S> it was a quarter past midday .: 14.92
<S> a spent ball ? not even that . what is it , then ? we have said that athos loved d artagnan like a child , and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man .: 46.64
<S> shoulder muskets !: 1317.29
<S> but such as is my hermitage , it is at your disposal ; such as is my supper , it is yours to share , if you will .: 50.95
<S> excellent ! said aramis .: 20.61
<S> at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away .: 16.84
<S> the couple , then , although they had not seen each other for eight days , and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned , accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation .: 36.17
<S> the result was that to prevent mm .: 54.98
<S> then , said the coadjutor , this evening , at ten o clock , and if i am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your disposal . the eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity , but he quickly suppressed his emotion .: 28.05
<S> yes , of course , mouston ; nothing else .: 33.01
<S> well , what is the matter ? the matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible , said rochefort , shaking his head with an air of disappointment .: 14.57
<S> monsieur de mazarin held us in prison , monsieur du vallon and myself , because we could not believe that he had sent us to england to quietly look on while they cut off the head of charles i. , brother in law of the late king , your husband , the consort of madame henrietta , your sister and your guest , and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal martyr .: 47.26
<S> the duke tore open the note , passed his hands over his eyes , for he was dazzled and confused , and read : my dear duke , you may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note ; he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at vincennes with you , in order to prepare and assist your escape , which we are contriving .: 49.93
<S> but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aramis .: 73.50
<S> you may retire ; we consent to that .: 58.23
<S> is that she , mamma ? asked euge nie ; almost opposite to us , with that profusion of beautiful light hair ? yes , said madame danglars , that is she .: 39.98
<S> and yet , as she could scarcely breathe , she rose and went towards a looking glass .: 28.63
<S> the shortest follies are best , my dear caderousse .: 75.33
<S> it is my cousin ! cried the procurator s wife .: 9.43
<S> his horse bounded to one side , losing its footing , and fell , entangling raoul s leg under its body .: 101.78
<S> raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes , who by a strange fancy , although she bore no resemblance , reminded him of his poor little louise , whom he had left in the chateau de la valliere and whom , in the midst of all the party , he had never for one moment quite forgotten .: 44.44
<S> we may well pity the poor fellows ! said the abbe .: 50.22
<S> he borrowed this from don quixote , the only book he had ever read , but which he still slightly remembered .: 83.63
<S> near her was mademoiselle louise d armilly , who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for italy , which she intended immediately to make use of .: 58.98
<S> i should want a porter . well , leave them with your porter ; he is to be trusted .: 52.65
<S> what does he want with me ?: 11.63
<S> here you are , home again , raoul , said the comte .: 34.14
<S> the harlequin had reassumed her peasant s costume , and as she passed she raised her mask .: 85.48
<S> but do not let us lose time ; you are the subject on which i wish to speak . true , we must be quick , for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together . ma foi ! said maximilian , in consternation .: 31.89
<S> tis an unfortunate year for kings , said the mother .: 52.87
<S> i beg your excellency s pardon for keeping you waiting , said the man , in the roman dialect , but i don t think i m many minutes after my time , ten o clock has just struck by the clock of saint john lateran . say not a word about being late , replied the stranger in purest tuscan ; tis i who am too soon .: 45.89
<S> athos , who had till that time said nothing for fear that d artagnan , interrupted in his turn , should not have the time necessary , from this moment declared that his name was athos , and not d artagnan .: 39.62
<S> grimaud , wishing to relieve him , advanced his hand toward the hilt of the dagger .: 31.38
<S> two varieties of demons chapter lxiii .: 58.30
<S> i shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me .: 66.77
<S> which route must i take ? demanded d artagnan , in his turn .: 36.13
<S> he had nothing more to do now , but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one .: 44.52
<S> glad ! he cried ; i should be more than glad !: 41.98
<S> then your father ought to have met with you on the road , for it is exactly the same route which he himself took , and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this place . but , said andrea , if my father had met me , i doubt if he would have recognized me ; i must be somewhat altered since he last saw me . oh , the voice of nature , said monte cristo .: 33.64
<S> you may be easy , then you ll get there . d artagnan then saw a musket barrel leveled at him ; he had no time to draw from his holsters .: 45.01
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> ah , your pardon , said albert , turning round ; will you allow me , captain ? and he lighted his cigar at vampa s torch .: 28.11
<S> oliver cromwell . very well , monsieur mordaunt , said mazarin , give me this second letter and sit down . the young man drew from his pocket a second letter , presented it to the cardinal , and took his seat .: 15.44
<S> so much the better , said d artagnan .: 4.56
<S> no , no , do not be deceived ; this was murder in every sense of the word . and who thus designated it ? the king himself . the king !: 40.26
<S> he s heavy , though , for an old and thin man , said one , as he raised the head .: 56.20
<S> the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for .: 38.85
<S> and in what have i been so unfortunate as to displease your majesty ? asked m. de tre ville , feigning the most profound astonishment .: 22.66
<S> by degrees the enchantress had clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw aside at will ; that is to say , beauty , meekness , and tears and above all , the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness , the most devouring of all voluptuousness .: 117.20
<S> come , come , calm yourself , madame puritan , or i ll remove you to a dungeon .: 45.56
<S> oh , yes ; she said , i saw , but i can not believe ! would you rather die , then , and cause maximilian s death ? oh , repeated the young girl , almost bewildered , can i not leave the house ? can i not escape ? valentine , the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere ; your servants will be seduced with gold , and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape .: 45.17
<S> by aramis is meant simara , which is the name of a demon .: 64.63
<S> come , come , said the young man , a glass of wine , father , will revive you .: 16.79
<S> upon this promise d artagnan withdrew , and the next day he began service .: 47.78
<S> athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an englishman .: 28.83
<S> all three then cried : all s over . hush ! said d artagnan .: 41.32
<S> his face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat .: 26.44
<S> the name of d artagnan was not altogether new to mazarin , who , although he did not arrive in france before the year 1634 or 1635 , that is to say , about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative , fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage , address and loyalty .: 49.66
<S> oh , decidedly , sir .: 22.09
<S> monseigneur , replied porthos , he has gone as a scout , on account of some words of our host , which made him believe the road was not safe . and you , what have you done , monsieur porthos ? i have won five pistoles of aramis . well ; now will you return with me ? we are at your eminence s orders . to horse , then , gentlemen ; for it is getting late . the attendant was at the door , holding the cardinal s horse by the bridle .: 32.10
<S> noble and unhappy king ! are you wounded ? cried aramis .: 39.45
<S> when he had finished with the orange tree , he began at the cactus ; but this , not being so easily plucked as the orange tree , pricked him dreadfully .: 59.27
<S> to this question the smugglers replied that , although successful in landing their cargo in safety , they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard ship had just quitted the port of toulon and was crowding all sail towards them .: 117.02
<S> she has always believed me , sire , to be her enemy ; although your majesty can bear witness that i have always taken her part warmly , even against you .: 80.55
<S> presently , presently , cried the latter , when you haven t your cloak on . at one o clock , then , behind the luxembourg . very well , at one o clock , then , replied d artagnan , turning the angle of the street .: 24.73
<S> now the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending parties .: 43.37
<S> d artagnan did not know where he was , and wished himself a hundred feet underground .: 23.35
<S> a prisoner , repeated porthos , quite dejected .: 38.62
<S> danglars accompanied him to the door , where he again assured albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of morcerf .: 40.19
<S> with him they will be gentle and docile as lambs . ali had , indeed , given proof of this ; for , approaching the animals , who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty , he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar , and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths .: 95.35
<S> allow me , then , if you please , to answer in different order , or i will not do so at all . the astonished president looked at the jury , who in turn looked at villefort .: 35.19
<S> yes , i know what you mean , he said ; you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world , that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months , and from which valentine has only escaped by a miracle , have not happened by natural means . i was not thinking of that , replied madame danglars quickly .: 45.45
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber ; but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night .: 28.29
<S> here , said he to him , are the diamond studs that you came to bring ; and be my witness that i have done all that human power could do . be satisfied , my lord , i will tell all that i have seen .: 26.72
<S> the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy , was now like a feather in his grasp ; he seized it , and attacked the wall .: 45.68
<S> the fog increased the darkness , and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become rainy .: 106.81
<S> show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal , unless , indeed unless ? said mordaunt , whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke : this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects . oh , my lord , my lord ! that title , said cromwell , laughing , is all very well here , but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public . but your honor will soon be called so generally . i hope so , at least , said cromwell , rising and putting on his cloak .: 58.95
<S> no , replied mousqueton , parry kept it .: 46.48
<S> i have no fear of ghosts , and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day .: 38.75
<S> major cavalcanti chapter 56 .: 38.46
<S> he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie .: 44.13
<S> well , said he , filling the glasses , let us drink to captain edmond dante s , husband of the beautiful catalane ! caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand , and swallowed the contents at a gulp .: 45.79
<S> as to you , good sir , you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong on that head .: 64.57
<S> this was a useless clause in the bargain , for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of africa , he runs down below , and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe . franz remained a moment silent and pensive , hardly knowing what to think of the half kindness , half cruelty , with which his host related the brief narrative .: 108.31
<S> i have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds ; i have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood ; on every occasion i have exposed my life to save those who were in danger , and i have preserved lives in exchange for that i took away .: 57.19
<S> unfortunately for him , the line of carriages moved on again , and while he descended the piazza del popolo , the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia .: 41.65
<S> well , then , to my health !: 11.20
<S> i am the friend of the great cardinal ! of the great cardinal ! perhaps you would contest his right to that title , madame ? i would contest nothing ; but i tell you that the favor of a minister is ephemeral , and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a minister .: 43.73
<S> what do you say ? inquired charles , rising .: 12.73
<S> coquenard .: 51.74
<S> they seek for him in the mountains , and he is on the waters ; they follow him on the waters , and he is on the open sea ; then they pursue him , and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands , at giglio , giannutri , or monte cristo ; and when they hunt for him there , he reappears suddenly at albano , tivoli , or la riccia . and how does he behave towards travellers ? alas !: 58.07
<S> if you loved me , oh , if you loved me , that would be too great happiness , and i should run mad .: 30.12
<S> luckily for the rascal , for i should have left him dead on the spot , i assure you . and what has became of him ? oh , i don t know ; he had enough , and set off without waiting for the rest .: 27.55
<S> it is right , said athos ; he has served your majesty longer than we have . the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes .: 37.68
<S> i defy you to find him who executed it . silence ! said a hollow voice .: 33.46
<S> you procure your mistresses from the opera , the vaudeville , or the varie te s ; i purchased mine at constantinople ; it cost me more , but i have nothing to fear . but you forget , replied debray , laughing , that we are franks by name and franks by nature , as king charles said , and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free . who will tell her ? the first person who sees her . she only speaks romaic . that is different . but at least we shall see her , said beauchamp , or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes ? oh , no , replied monte cristo ; i do not carry brutalism so far .: 60.09
<S> it appears that he had met with disagreeableness , likewise , on his journey .: 27.67
<S> after charles i. , cromwell ; after cromwell , charles ii. , and then james ii. , and then some son in law or relation , some prince of orange , a stadtholder who becomes a king .: 146.85
<S> as soon as possible , m. danglars ; today all preliminaries will be arranged at my father s , and tomorrow , or next day at latest , the wedding festival here at la re serve .: 45.94
<S> and what will that signify to me ?: 14.93
<S> the other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of edmond dante s .: 35.45
<S> however insignificant i am , i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death . be easy , said d artagnan , he will know all before night . the little troop recommenced their march , and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead .: 47.02
<S> has this woman been relating her crimes to you ?: 77.54
<S> the explosion soon followed ; the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder ; the lower one flew into pieces ; thousands of insects escaped from the aperture dante s had previously formed , and a huge snake , like the guardian demon of the treasure , rolled himself along in darkening coils , and disappeared .: 112.79
<S> the balance would come to about that sum ; but keep it , and we shall be quits . count , said danglars , are you speaking seriously ? i never joke with bankers , said monte cristo in a freezing manner , which repelled impertinence ; and he turned to the door , just as the valet de chambre announced : m .: 50.37
<S> on the eve of departure i carry my egotism so far as to say , do not forget me , my kind friends , for probably you will never see me again . never see you again ? exclaimed emmanuel , while two large tears rolled down julie s cheeks , never behold you again ?: 53.11
<S> he was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling , declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before , near the palace .: 58.98
<S> one would think it had been placed here on purpose . get on it ; that s it , friend . and d artagnan coughed .: 56.26
<S> hung by order of his highness the duc de beaufort ! cried the prisoner , laughing violently , and by master jacques chrysostom la ramee , the king s commissioner . la ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet , which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window .: 37.24
<S> a deputation was therefore sent to the queen to entreat her to return to paris ; but she not only declined to receive the deputies , but sent an intimation by chancellor seguier , implying that if the parliament did not humble itself before her majesty by negativing all the questions that had been the cause of the quarrel , paris would be besieged the very next day .: 64.67
<S> the guard obeyed .: 32.55
<S> she had one hope , which was that felton would appear at the breakfast hour ; but felton did not come .: 42.74
<S> fortunately , a mendicant passed , who , coming up to athos to ask charity , athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was going .: 66.21
<S> i can hold out no longer , for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment when i shall be forced to undergo the struggle , and confess my faith .: 42.47
<S> the orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience , and , very prudently , have no hell that is the point . 30075m really , madame , this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours , but which would easily yield before sound reasoning .: 79.26
<S> not in the least ; but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted . everything depends on you . explain yourself , pray . monsieur , said morrel , recovering his assurance as he proceeded , do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor , i came to intercede for a young man , the mate of my ship , who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba ?: 39.43
<S> everything considered , i am not sorry to retain grimaud ; he is accustomed to my ways , and i am particular .: 54.75
<S> by my faith , it is very fortunate that the letter was not in it . they ll kill poor porthos when he comes up , said aramis .: 41.03
<S> i would not choose to see the man against whom i pleaded smile , as though in mockery of my words .: 39.58
<S> but peppino , instead of answering , threw himself on his knees , seized the count s hand , and covered it with kisses .: 11.97
<S> speak , or no absolution ! the dying man collected all his forces .: 76.26
<S> in the night he slept , but in the morning , refreshed and calm , he was inspired with his clearest views of everything .: 57.30
<S> albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered him .: 67.56
<S> i know what i am saying , continued the marchioness ; i must hurry you , so that , as she has no mother , she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage .: 54.53
<S> i will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump , said he . well done ! said the englishman .: 35.25
<S> gentlemen , he said , our presence here is the best proof of former friendship ; not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous ; not one has , therefore , to reproach himself . hear me , count , replied d artagnan ; instead of making compliments to each other , let us explain our conduct to each other , like men of right and honest hearts . i wish for nothing more ; have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur d herblay ?: 42.02
<S> the palais de justice communicated with the prison , a sombre edifice , that from its grated windows looks on the clock tower of the accoules .: 87.73
<S> mousqueton , duly instructed , was put at the head of this sudden and new business .: 87.78
<S> we must play the farce to the end .: 43.73
<S> and what cares he for that , replied gaetano with a laugh , or any authorities ?: 84.06
<S> i have it with me . the sharp gaze of caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest s garments , as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure .: 50.14
<S> the lamp went out for want of oil , but she paid no heed to the darkness , and dawn came , but she knew not that it was day .: 46.48
<S> rochefort , said the cardinal , you see monsieur d artagnan .: 14.56
<S> when the operation was concluded , and edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth , and his hair reduced to its usual length , he asked for a looking glass .: 42.73
<S> they have commissioned me to write to the major to demand papers , and here they are .: 46.22
<S> his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek .: 96.23
<S> athos , then , went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time , continued tre ville , to a young be arnais , a cadet in his majesty s guards , the company of monsieur dessessart , but scarcely had he arrived at his friend s and taken up a book , while waiting his return , when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house , broke open several doors the cardinal made the king a sign , which signified , that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you . we all know that , interrupted the king ; for all that was done for our service . then , said tre ville , it was also for your majesty s service that one of my musketeers , who was innocent , has been seized , that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor , and that this gallant man , who has ten times shed his blood in your majesty s service and is ready to shed it again , has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace ? bah ! said the king , who began to be shaken , was it so managed ? monsieur de tre ville , said the cardinal , with the greatest phlegm , does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer , this gallant man , had only an hour before attacked , sword in hand , four commissaries of inquiry , who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance . i defy your eminence to prove it , cried tre ville , with his gascon freedom and military frankness ; for one hour before , monsieur athos , who , i will confide it to your majesty , is really a man of the highest quality , did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my ho tel , with the duc de la tre mouille and the comte de cha lus , who happened to be there . the king looked at the cardinal .: 45.11
<S> athos , replied the musketeer .: 15.84
<S> yes , sir , she replied , every confidence ; speak . will the queen deign to follow my advice ? speak . let your majesty dismiss m. de comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables . comminges glanced at d artagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up .: 65.41
<S> dante s went and cut the strongest olive tree he could find , stripped off its branches , inserted it in the hole , and used it as a lever .: 55.53
<S> he felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him .: 44.27
<S> shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows , and hid from the garden and court these two apartments , the only rooms into which , as they were on the ground floor , the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate .: 59.79
<S> aramis muttered to himself , we shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things . porthos sucked his mustache , muttering , a good deal of ceremony to night about crushing an adder . athos shrunk into his corner , pale and motionless as a bas relief .: 85.73
<S> i can not be mistaken ; there are your horses !: 24.03
<S> something like a smile was perceptible on madame de villefort s countenance .: 31.57
<S> no one has come out , he replied .: 15.72
<S> who is there ? answered the voice of her he sought .: 35.44
<S> where is the count ? where is hayde e ? look ! said jacopo .: 27.71
<S> but you , d artagnan , what is the matter with you , and what has happened to you personally ?: 13.24
<S> my lord , said d artagnan , will lend his , which is of no use to him , to the comte de la fere . willingly , said the cardinal ; i will even ask the count to keep it for my sake . i promise you , my lord , never to part with it , replied athos .: 20.06
<S> there is neither happiness nor misery in the world ; there is only the comparison of one state with another , nothing more .: 69.33
<S> i am willing to help rebuild your fortune , but i will not be an accomplice in the ruin of others . but since i tell you , cried danglars , that with these three million do you expect to recover your position , sir , without touching those three million ? i hope so , if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit . shall you be able to pay m. cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry ? he shall receive them on returning from the mayor s20 . very well ! what next ?: 43.64
<S> the cause was not in dante s , but in providence , who , while limiting the power of man , has filled him with boundless desires .: 66.60
<S> have i , sir , comprehended your instructions ? athos smiled .: 42.59
<S> so you are not a mazarinist ?: 24.51
<S> yes , the priest . oh , i inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise ; but he was beforehand with me , he had quit the curacy the night before . was it ever known who this miserable fellow was ? he was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady .: 64.07
<S> groslow jumped up , ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine , cards , and dice .: 69.38
<S> oh , yes , with all my soul . well , then , listen , valentine , said the count ; i have a favor to ask of you . of me ?: 16.53
<S> a short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage stopped , peppino opened the door , and the count and franz alighted .: 40.55
<S> it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondy s coachman .: 27.59
<S> no , no ; i shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret , as you say .: 36.01
<S> the countess , said morcerf , was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive .: 31.19
<S> 28 gaspard puget , the sculptor architect , was born at marseilles in 1615 .: 115.16
<S> no ; explain yourself , i beg . as he mistrusted me , he determined to guard you himself , and sent me in his place to get buckingham to sign the order for your transportation . but if he mistrusted you , how could he confide such an order to you ? how could i know what i was the bearer of ? that s true !: 47.12
<S> let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken .: 50.75
<S> pardieu ! replied d artagnan , for my part , i am eating veal garnished with shrimps and vegetables . and i some lamb chops , said porthos .: 55.11
<S> at ten o clock , the king s collation , consisting of preserves and other delicacies , was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of st. jean , in front of the silver buffet of the city , which was guarded by four archers .: 25.28
<S> at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince .: 20.20
<S> faith !: 32.97
<S> in the court are orange trees in pots , turf , and clumps of flowers . and no steel traps ? no . the stables ? are on either side of the gate , which you see there . and andrea continued his plan .: 57.45
<S> beauchamp , one of the kings of the press , and therefore claiming the right of a throne everywhere , was eying everybody through his monocle .: 64.59
<S> he had not chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that a woman had come there alone about eleven o clock the night before , had engaged a chamber , had sent for the master of the ho tel , and told him she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood .: 44.24
<S> yes , for time presses . how many men have you about the palais royal ? six hundred . place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for me . madame , cried mazarin , what are you about ? go ! said the queen .: 53.10
<S> now , monsieur de chavigny is not amiable , i allow , but monsieur du tremblay is considerably worse . indeed ! exclaimed the duke , who from time to time looked at the clock , the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness .: 33.40
<S> caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes , then handed them to his wife , who counted and counted them again in her turn .: 62.92
<S> now , the scripture says positively , make a sacrifice unto the lord . that is true , said his antagonists .: 63.35
<S> he looked from one to the other and after mordaunt he recognized groslow .: 76.53
<S> besides , to do all this , time is necessary months , years ; and she has ten or twelve days , as lord de winter , her fraternal and terrible jailer , has told her .: 73.22
<S> can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties .: 28.27
<S> one arm was hanging out of the bed ; from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of germain pillon s graces , 23 but the fore arm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion , and the hand , so delicately formed , was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed .: 107.02
<S> it was , that another partook of his punishment that another partook of his anguish that another was to die before him !: 69.61
<S> but you , madame , you appear to be free , continued the novice ; and if you were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do so . whither would you have me go , without friends , without money , in a part of france with which i am unacquainted , and where i have never been before ? oh , cried the novice , as to friends , you would have them wherever you want , you appear so good and are so beautiful ! that does not prevent , replied milady , softening her smile so as to give it an angelic expression , my being alone or being persecuted . hear me , said the novice ; we must trust in heaven .: 51.33
<S> i detest him !: 24.76
<S> vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion ; while , on the contrary , teresa , shuddering in every limb , dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees , and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover .: 45.63
<S> why , what ails you ? asked he of edmond .: 16.40
<S> adieu , then , and be of good courage , said athos .: 23.48
<S> they conducted me to the chatelet , where i slept soundly , being very sure that on the next day i should go forth free .: 50.78
<S> danglars meditated an escape ; but the walls were solid rock , a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell , and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually passed .: 165.24
<S> countess , returned franz , totally unheeding her raillery , i asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian lady opposite ; i must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her husband ? nay , answered the countess , i know no more of him than yourself . perhaps you never before noticed him ? what a question so truly french !: 76.01
<S> this time it was the hour , and from this moment milady waited with impatience .: 23.67
<S> come , one may easily see , vicomte , that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen him .: 56.76
<S> you do not know what he is about in the cellar .: 12.44
<S> in the meantime please to sit down , monsieur , and i will fetch you some refreshment . the jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince .: 46.22
<S> d artagnan was worn out with fatigue .: 21.94
<S> i didn t understand it all , he said , but i understand now ; how droll it is ! you think so ?: 33.10
<S> then , turning to his desk , he said , striking the letter with the back of his right hand : come , i had a forgery , three robberies , and two cases of arson , i only wanted a murder , and here it is .: 35.39
<S> mazarin took the letter and read it thus : mr .: 57.22
<S> thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke , as aramis had called him , often took part with the king s musketeers in these quarrels .: 89.38
<S> that health , which excellent , my dear friend ; better than ever .: 109.84
<S> the three gentlemen took the road to picardy , a road so well known to them and which recalled to athos and aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their youth .: 44.39
<S> monsieur , said morrel , whose uneasiness was increased by this examination , you wish to speak to me ? yes , monsieur ; you are aware from whom i come ? the house of thomson french ; at least , so my cashier tells me . he has told you rightly .: 30.06
<S> upon reaching their stalls , they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the russian ambassador .: 89.47
<S> it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice , and she was about to utter an exclamation .: 22.23
<S> she thinks of me , then , after five years of separation !: 35.69
<S> you are my friend today ; tomorrow you will be no more to me than a shadow , or rather , even , you will no longer exist .: 30.37
<S> when the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men .: 191.68
<S> the blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for monsieur de tre ville .: 65.30
<S> in august we lost 300,000 francs at the beginning of the month , but on the 13th we made up for it , and we now find that our accounts , reckoning from the first day of partnership up to yesterday , when i closed them , showed a capital of 2,400,000 francs , that is , 1,200,000 for each of us .: 82.41
<S> what do you think of that exploit , my lord ? it is magnificent ! said mazarin , thoughtfully .: 16.21
<S> dante s had spoken of merce de s , and villefort instantly recognized her .: 19.05
<S> the other , who was safe and sound , continued his way toward the camp .: 34.10
<S> that s my room , replied groslow .: 22.17
<S> she looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake ; but d artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her .: 28.90
<S> half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear ; but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water , i contended longer , and instead of falling entirely asleep , i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me , while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly .: 57.59
<S> she raised the hand extended towards her to her lips , and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect .: 21.94
<S> how did this happen ? said morrel .: 16.43
<S> porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians ; d artagnan ate in silence , revolving in his mind the most audacious plans .: 103.25
<S> monsieur de richelieu would have said , five hundred crowns for the councillor . well , let s say no more about it .: 50.64
<S> three quarters of an hour after , barrois returned , bringing the notary with him .: 24.22
<S> the duke de guise killed monsieur de coligny in the place royale and nothing was said of it . ah , things go on gaily , then , said porthos .: 46.04
<S> that , it seems , is where he meditates on state affairs . in that case , said d artagnan , i begin to believe that monsieur de la fere will receive the visit of his eminence ; he will , of course , have an escort . yes two soldiers . and will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers ? the soldiers are swiss , who understand only german .: 46.89
<S> ah ! cried the cardinal , i thought you were a gascon , my friend ? i am a gascon , said i , only when i succeed . the answer pleased him and he laughed .: 30.17
<S> in a few minutes , laporte was at the lodge ; in two words d artagnan informed him where mme .: 31.86
<S> listen , then , to the supplication of a despairing woman .: 24.55
<S> i wish to kill you , be at rest as to that , but to kill you quietly in a snug , remote place , where you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody . i agree , monsieur ; but do not be too confident .: 45.04
<S> the catalan watched him until caderousse , almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses , rested , or rather dropped , his glass upon the table .: 90.79
<S> he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter , signed baronne danglars , ne e hermine de servieux . albert was accompanied by lucien debray , who , joining in his friend s conversation , added some passing compliments , the source of which the count s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess .: 68.23
<S> to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy ?: 105.43
<S> the french ladies , madame .: 51.48
<S> luigi vampa . if by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands , by seven o clock the count albert will have ceased to live . this second signature explained everything to franz , who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment ; the street was safer for him .: 56.06
<S> in a moment they were at the canebie re .: 18.29
<S> one by one the several groups broke up .: 107.99
<S> the count of monte cristo ! said danglars , more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and misery .: 41.66
<S> stuff and nonsense ; we have seen plenty of dead men in our time . hearing these words , the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms .: 57.19
<S> well , my dear mouston , he said , rest satisfied .: 24.20
<S> i do this , oh , my god , said he , with his eyes raised to heaven , as much for thy honor as for mine .: 34.20
<S> the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat , leaving two gaping wounds from which , as well as the mouth , the blood was pouring in floods .: 75.53
<S> and you what are you doing here ? replied d artagnan .: 9.98
<S> die ?: 118.35
<S> i paused , but i had already drunk half a glass .: 37.31
<S> the usurper converted ! decidedly , my dear duke . in what way converted ? to good principles .: 105.58
<S> d artagnan , continued athos , you , who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to monseigneur , here it is ; avail yourself of it . these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger , and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth .: 80.62
<S> athos recognized grimaud .: 38.18
<S> brunhilda and fredegund were the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its infancy , when man was learning to control mind , were it even by an emissary from the realms of darkness .: 89.77
<S> coquenard drew the dish toward her , skillfully detached the two great black feet , which she placed upon her husband s plate , cut off the neck , which with the head she put on one side for herself , raised the wing for porthos , and then returned the bird otherwise intact to the servant who had brought it in , who disappeared with it before the musketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment produces upon faces , according to the characters and temperaments of those who experience it .: 83.12
<S> there was not on the pavement , in the carriages , at the windows , a single tongue that was silent , a single arm that did not move .: 39.66
<S> i have been myself to the best engraver of the palais royal , who did the plate in my presence .: 36.85
<S> at the noise i raised myself up on one hand .: 24.83
<S> franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream .: 17.12
<S> as a soldier the man ranks well ; he did his whole duty and even more , at the siege of rochelle as at suze and perpignan . but you know , guitant , we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besides courage ; we want men of talent .: 163.04
<S> i fancied myself despised , betrayed .: 54.87
<S> see what good fortune i brought you ! said morrel , when he was alone with the count .: 39.58
<S> acknowledge , that if albert is brave , he can not be a coward ; he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning , and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise . doubtless , doubtless , said morrel ; but i shall say , like the spaniard , he has not been so brave today as he was yesterday . you will breakfast with me , will you not , morrel ? said the count , to turn the conversation .: 34.63
<S> it is not courage that is needed ; it is prudence . and yet , cried porthos , we will not leave you will leave d artagnan to act as he thinks proper , said athos .: 34.77
<S> one was perfectly charming , delicate , pensive , shaded by beautiful dark hair , and eyes soft as velvet , like those lovely flowers , the heartsease , in which shine out the golden petals .: 68.72
<S> god will respect his profession , and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest . a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest .: 97.62
<S> shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all . then the steps retreated , and the voices died away in the distance ; the noise of the door , with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased , and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued , the silence of death , which was all pervasive , and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dante s .: 61.58
<S> you had your secret and we had ours ; we didn t exchange them .: 106.59
<S> the queen entered and d artagnan remained at the door .: 12.09
<S> aramis , suffering at once in body and mind , had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts upon religion , and he had considered as a warning from heaven the double accident which had happened to him ; that is to say , the sudden disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder .: 51.83
<S> the latter , on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him , endeavored to raise himself up in his bed ; but he was too weak , and exhausted by the effort , he fell back again almost senseless .: 35.61
<S> the mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of saint eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other .: 60.39
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> my friends , said parry , mounting the scaffold and standing beside them , would you work a little more quietly ?: 110.55
<S> you must accomplish loyally the commission with which i deign to charge you , and on that condition i pardon everything , i forget everything ; and what is more , and she held out her hand to him , i restore my love . bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious , but he loved his wife .: 51.77
<S> who are you , sir , asked she , who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account ? you may perceive , madame , by my uniform , that i am an officer in the english navy , replied the young man .: 26.72
<S> and pray what was this quarrel about ? these fellows were drunk , said athos , and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening , they wanted to force her door . force her door ! said the cardinal , and for what purpose ? to do her violence , without doubt , said athos .: 52.71
<S> speak , said the queen .: 8.71
<S> it is understood , of course , that when we say the queen , mazarin is meant .: 37.72
<S> mordaunt , therefore , raised the canvas , and saw cromwell seated before a table , his head buried in his hands , his back being turned .: 44.06
<S> of three guardsmen of the company of m. dessessart who were passing , two came to the assistance of the four companions , while the other ran toward the ho tel of m. de tre ville , crying , to the rescue , musketeers !: 28.57
<S> porthos was delighted ; and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied .: 41.29
<S> i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser , said monte cristo , did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends , and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too ; therefore , in departing from this rule , i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line , and should , therefore , run the risk of being hissed , which would be an act of folly . however , your excellency , said andrea , in consideration of lord wilmore , by whom i was recommended to you yes , certainly , interrupted monte cristo ; but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me , my dear m. andrea , that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one .: 57.29
<S> call for help ! useless ! said athos , useless !: 51.37
<S> i shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit .: 61.30
<S> he loi se , he loi se ! he said , what is the matter ?: 11.88
<S> the duc de chatillon commanded the centre .: 42.21
<S> you have saved my life , and i thank you , continued dante s .: 13.65
<S> a young and beautiful girl , with hair as black as jet , her eyes as velvety as the gazelle s , was leaning with her back against the wainscot , rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms , the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor ; her arms , bare to the elbow , brown , and modelled after those of the arlesian venus , moved with a kind of restless impatience , and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot , so as to display the pure and full shape of her well turned leg , in its red cotton , gray and blue clocked , stocking .: 65.90
<S> it would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this . doubtless , doubtless , athos .: 41.42
<S> eh !: 18.68
<S> this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos , frightened him .: 80.81
<S> do you absolutely think that the palais royal is the abode of gayety ?: 35.17
<S> his countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite principles a wicked nature , subdued by determination , perhaps by repentance .: 167.46
<S> said monte cristo you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses . provided i understand your perfidy , sir , and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged , i shall be reasonable enough , said albert furiously .: 42.60
<S> the young man appeared on the threshold of the minister s closet , in one hand holding his hat , in the other the letter .: 27.34
<S> give me your hand and let us go to the minister ; and yet , she added , suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle ? his majesty will then take refuge in holland , where i hear his highness the prince of wales now is . and can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight ? alas !: 57.35
<S> you no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door ? certainly , your excellency .: 50.12
<S> i am , temporarily , commander of the pharaon , with the certainty of being permanently so , if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue .: 65.95
<S> but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit , and applauded himself for having put it in action , an inhabitant of la rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines god knows how , such was the watchfulness of bassompierre , schomberg , and the duc d angoule me , themselves watched over by the cardinal an inhabitant of la rochelle , we say , entered the city , coming from portsmouth , and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days .: 75.56
<S> one ! said the grave diggers , two !: 82.05
<S> the two musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes .: 21.66
<S> gentlemen , said he , in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances , gentlemen , m. noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m. franz de quesnel , baron d e pinay . he , as well as the notary , that there might be no mistake in the person , gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect .: 48.55
<S> no , we were mistaken ; he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond .: 32.83
<S> we are compelled to admit to our readers that d artagnan thought nothing about him in any way ; or that if he did think of him , it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was , wherever it might be .: 25.58
<S> attend to monsieur le cardinal , gentlemen , said d artagnan ; for myself , i will reconnoitre . the gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard .: 40.19
<S> at this moment a strange noise , like the unloading of a cart , and followed by a cry of pain , was heard beneath the window .: 20.28
<S> he is going to turn his house into a badhaus , as the germans term it .: 49.93
<S> olivain , take care of our horses and give me my sword . the two gentlemen then went into the church .: 25.62
<S> for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at tre port , it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom , while i return , more contented , more peaceful shall i say more poetic ! than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion . 30279m that is an overwhelming demonstration , and you would make everyone vow to live a single life . such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars .: 123.38
<S> ah , monsieur hypocrite , i understand how you study theology . the three blows were scarcely struck , when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter .: 53.49
<S> monsieur bertuccio chapter 43 .: 47.98
<S> i did announce myself , in truth , as coming on the part of the marechal de grammont ; but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the count de guiche acted as his secretary . there has been fighting , then ? asked the queen , motioning to raoul to rise .: 44.21
<S> he approached her and said in a low voice : has your majesty still confidence in me ? this voice startled her .: 40.35
<S> the officers perceived that they had not to deal with a gentleman , and they treated him like a very peasant .: 34.82
<S> the man took his way toward the city .: 20.71
<S> you wore a close ruff , a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe , and in that cap a heron s feather .: 68.36
<S> he alone could have transmitted to lord de winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered , one after another , by a train of fatalities .: 62.98
<S> the lions den one division of la force , in which the most dangerous and desperate prisoners are confined , is called the court of saint bernard .: 59.58
<S> we performed the usual burial service , and he is at his rest , sewn up in his hammock with a thirty six pound shot at his head and his heels , off el giglio island .: 136.88
<S> yes , that you sent me . we sent you wine ? you know very well the wine from the hills of anjou . yes , i know what brand you are talking about . the wine you prefer . well , in the absence of champagne and chambertin , you must content yourselves with that . and so , connoisseurs in wine as we are , we have sent you some anjou wine ? said porthos .: 53.09
<S> the decanters broken in pieces , and the fruits crushed , strewed the floor .: 115.14
<S> could you have been so cruel as not to bring her ? calm yourself .: 56.82
<S> there were four musketeers on the bottom steps , amusing themselves with the following exercise , while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to take their turn in the sport .: 61.90
<S> mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket , but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole .: 37.96
<S> i hear my brother .: 25.32
<S> but , never mind , he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time , so he s welcome . as edmond paused , the black and bearded head of caderousse appeared at the door .: 54.84
<S> recollect the ancient romans of the circus , and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred men .: 56.01
<S> d artagnan , who had loved him so tenderly , loved him still , although a mazarinist .: 42.31
<S> conspiracy danglars followed edmond and merce de s with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of fort saint nicolas ; then , turning round , he perceived fernand , who had fallen , pale and trembling , into his chair , while caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking song .: 55.10
<S> when the three persons he expected had entered , he looked at the door , which his valet immediately closed .: 39.93
<S> truly , a byronic hero !: 87.10
<S> there was no longer a doubt that felton was convinced ; felton was hers .: 36.10
<S> sir , said beauchamp , who had not yet spoken , you appear to accuse the count , who is absent from paris at this moment , and can not justify himself . i accuse no one , sir , said danglars ; i relate , and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you . does the count know what answer you received ? yes ; i showed it to him . did he know my father s christian name was fernand , and his family name mondego ? yes , i had told him that long since , and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances , and perhaps less .: 37.66
<S> your eminence might knock against something , or fall into a hole . monsieur d artagnan ! muttered mazarin , unable to recover from his astonishment .: 34.86
<S> 15 a turkish pasha in command of the troops of a province . ed .: 88.34
<S> god keep me from it , my dear monsieur mordaunt !: 33.42
<S> oh , my god !: 5.20
<S> just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn , a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn .: 34.55
<S> and besides , he considered it most expedient , without exhibiting too much ill will , to follow to the end his role as confessor .: 99.15
<S> aramis assumed that perilous charge .: 132.68
<S> constancy and discretion . well , asked he , when franz had finished , what do you think of that ? i think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance . i think so , also , replied albert ; and i very much fear you will go alone to the duke of bracciano s ball . franz and albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated roman banker .: 42.14
<S> we are cousins , it appears , monsieur porthos ? said the procurator , rising , yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair .: 39.39
<S> aramis was astonished .: 38.18
<S> you , morcerf ? replied the secretary , resting on the stairs .: 45.45
<S> the leave of absence monsieur has asked for , replied the lackey .: 70.88
<S> buckingham in paris ! cried he , and why does he come ? to conspire , no doubt , with your enemies , the huguenots and the spaniards . no , pardieu , no !: 36.34
<S> but dante s was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man .: 41.17
<S> you say , excuse me , and you believe that is sufficient ?: 29.94
<S> caderousse , then , was , as usual , at his place of observation before the door , his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grass on which some fowls were industriously , though fruitlessly , endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate to the deserted road , which led away to the north and south , when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife , and grumbling to himself as he went , he mounted to her chamber , first taking care , however , to set the entrance door wide open , as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing .: 96.83
<S> i am cold , sir , said mousqueton .: 12.20
<S> would not one say he was speaking of a religious community ?: 127.99
<S> cha teau renaud rented a stall beside his own , while beauchamp , as a journalist , had unlimited range all over the theatre .: 67.80
<S> you think of everything , said d artagnan ; and i thank you for planchet , my dear athos . raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed .: 29.62
<S> oh , mon dieu ! he said , raising his fine eyes to d artagnan , moist with tears , the count has left paris without seeing me ? he left four days ago , said d artagnan .: 18.72
<S> no object affects me ; and i even feel here , at the bottom of my heart , something which speaks for you .: 53.05
<S> our group would then be quite complete , more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a madonna . well , said franz , this time , m. albert , i am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea . and quite a national one , too , replied albert with gratified pride .: 61.53
<S> let us go , said athos and aramis .: 8.50
<S> i will tell you , mr. president .: 17.44
<S> everywhere were swords , pistols , cuirasses , and arquebuses , and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better monsieur de bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel .: 66.11
<S> i call those first rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one s hand , such as mines , lands , and funded property , in such states as france , austria , and england , provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions ; i call those second rate fortunes , that are gained by manufacturing enterprises , joint stock companies , viceroyalties , and principalities , not drawing more than 1,500,000 francs , the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions ; finally , i call those third rate fortunes , which are composed of a fluctuating capital , dependent upon the will of others , or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes , such as banks , speculations of the day in fact , all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances , the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions .: 102.14
<S> the young man and young woman perceived they were watched , and redoubled their speed .: 44.75
<S> whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident , monsieur bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed .: 60.92
<S> what must be done then ? asked the general . i have my carriage here , said the president .: 27.96
<S> the morning dawned dull and gloomy , and villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red ink .: 79.27
<S> the officer alone went on board , where he was received with all the deference inspired by the uniform .: 36.52
<S> i beg you , therefore , to excuse if you find anything in me too turkish , too italian , or too arabian .: 64.49
<S> monsieur the principal of amiens , monsieur the curate of montdidier , and i are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested ; i shall be delighted to have your opinion . the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight , replied d artagnan , who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking , and you had better be satisfied , believe me , with the knowledge of these gentlemen . the two men in black bowed in their turn .: 35.85
<S> well , the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor , the spaniards did not shoot the traitor , ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished ; but i , betrayed , sacrificed , buried , have risen from my tomb , by the grace of god , to punish that man .: 68.13
<S> planchet had no need to learn more .: 35.85
<S> he had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the bottom of the silver casket , and to let the knife fall into it , making a sign to laporte that he was no longer able to speak ; then , in a last convulsion , which this time he had not the power to combat , he slipped from the sofa to the floor .: 31.26
<S> here , said caderousse , draw me all that on the paper , my boy . andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began .: 32.66
<S> if i obtain the situation i desire , i shall owe it to m. morrel .: 30.81
<S> i am for you not only a protector , but a friend ; not only a benefactor , but a father .: 35.45
<S> many a long year has passed since any one has wanted to employ me ; so you see in what a situation i am . make your complaints known ; that s my advice . listen , rochefort ; let us make a compact .: 72.86
<S> alas , i have them no longer ! how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity ? it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends , monsieur ; because i have acted like queen marie de medicis , who , returning from her first exile , treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and , being proscribed a second time , died at cologne abandoned by every one , even by her own son . well , let us see , said mazarin ; isn t there still time to repair the evil ?: 76.89
<S> tomorrow this order will be sent to the duke of buckingham .: 24.33
<S> yield ! he cried , or you are a dead man ! the musket fell from the soldier s hands , who yielded on the instant .: 38.60
<S> take care , madame , said the young man , coolly , you will kill yourself in jumping . milady reseated herself , foaming .: 26.22
<S> the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states .: 25.52
<S> she undertook his seduction , and succeeded ; she would have seduced a saint .: 103.29
<S> she prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinking , for since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever , after which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil , and lighted his chibouque , which he sometimes smoked for hours together , quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere .: 104.04
<S> on going home , the two friends found a letter from athos , who desired them to meet him at the grand charlemagne on the following day .: 23.30
<S> they waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear aramis was not coming to join them .: 54.25
<S> he then formed a resolution .: 42.09
<S> i will give them to you on condition that you let me go . why do you offer me 4,000,000 for what is worth 5,000,000 ?: 38.86
<S> at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall , leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter .: 28.83
<S> why , it is after one o clock . your home is a paradise , porthos ; one takes no note of time .: 45.96
<S> how d artagnan and porthos earned by selling straw .: 41.45
<S> un vent de fronde s est leve ce matin . it doesn t surprise me , said d artagnan , in a low tone to porthos , that mazarin would have been much better satisfied had i crushed the life out of his councillor . you understand , then , monsieur , resumed planchet , that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against monsieur broussel that you should ask me to take my carbine no , don t be alarmed ; but where did you get all these details ? from a good source , sir ; i heard it from friquet . from friquet ?: 50.01
<S> the king was lying on his bed , resting on his elbow .: 15.74
<S> the young man read valentine s letter twenty times in the course of the day .: 29.59
<S> madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity .: 31.15
<S> then from the bottom of this passage , the depth of which it was impossible to measure , he saw appear , first the head , then the shoulders , and lastly the body of a man , who sprang lightly into his cell .: 37.31
<S> if mousqueton were here !: 90.03
<S> my god ! at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock , rather than opened ; several men rushed into the chamber .: 30.07
<S> i shall return very safely to the louvre all alone . as you please , madame bonacieux , said the ex mercer .: 41.13
<S> we will escape , and if we can not escape we will talk ; you of those whom you love , and i of those whom i love .: 37.17
<S> all the day , all the next night passed away without my seeing him again .: 50.90
<S> monsieur d artagnan , said the valet de chambre .: 7.00
<S> to save yourselves , to scamper away , to flee that is good for the king s musketeers ! porthos and aramis trembled with rage .: 47.75
<S> the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor , but they had seen him , upon quitting the hut , merely give some orders to a sailor , and then springing lightly on horseback , leave marseilles by the porte d aix .: 85.83
<S> athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been practicing in a fencing school .: 54.90
<S> from whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence ? from general oliver cromwell , said the new comer .: 62.12
<S> i wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty eighth strip about a week ago .: 53.43
<S> besides , you are right in another respect , which is in thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a better time than the present . how can you know that ?: 35.11
<S> villefort walked to and fro behind them .: 27.95
<S> you know that the famous waistcoat was found in his house , containing the letter which stopped the signature of the marriage contract .: 50.18
<S> the chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman ; and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish , but on casting her eyes about the apartment , she would have found that wish accomplished .: 61.84
<S> go but to portsmouth or southampton , and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the english as can afford the expense , and have the same liking for this amusement .: 73.00
<S> porthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the shoulder .: 70.92
<S> monte cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him .: 20.43
<S> consequently , valentine came up to noirtier , on leaving madame de saint me ran , who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep .: 33.89
<S> fortunately lord de winter is rich . lord de winter is ruined for the moment ; oliver cromwell has annexed his income resources . now is the time when baron porthos would be useful . now it is that i regret d artagnan . let us entice them away . this secret , aramis , does not belong to us ; take my advice , then , and let no one into our confidence .: 49.81
<S> is he handsome ? she asked .: 20.56
<S> blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor .: 134.94
<S> well , then , will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome ? with pleasure . there was a cry of shut up ! from the audience .: 55.32
<S> at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats , i had with a child s caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined ; but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mother s voice when she enjoined me to silence , that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given .: 78.25
<S> for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions .: 178.38
<S> sit down , madame , and let us talk , as the cardinal said . milady , under the influence of inexpressible terror , sat down without uttering a word .: 26.32
<S> five days after your departure , he came back , and in a very bad condition , too .: 27.33
<S> ah , but you are joking , my worthy man ! said d artagnan .: 13.02
<S> i want recommendations and some information relative to africa .: 153.40
<S> no one had taken up the remark about the general , and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of yanina the noble count in the house of peers .: 44.27
<S> as to bazin , he went and lay down on a truss of straw ; and as he had more imagination than the swiss , he dreamed that aramis , having become pope , adorned his head with a cardinal s hat .: 41.85
<S> one man alone remained in his place , gun in hand .: 43.49
<S> i have seen him ; that is he !: 17.29
<S> the assizes , also , were about to begin , and villefort , shut up in his room , exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of caderousse .: 58.83
<S> kill , said she , but spare the honor of the widow of ali . it is not to me to whom you must address yourself , said kourchid .: 41.71
<S> the same order was followed in returning , nor did grimaud s searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance , save a dark shadow , as it were , in ambuscade , at the corner of the rue guenegaud and of the quai .: 60.79
<S> well ? said athos .: 8.70
<S> forgive me ! cried edmond , blushing deeply .: 35.54
<S> that name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought .: 123.32
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> come , tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you . god forgive me , said the young man , for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others , but , heaven knows , i did not seek this good fortune ; it has happened , and i really can not pretend to lament it .: 43.31
<S> i was not so in my youth , i was not so on the night of the betrothal , when we were all seated around a table in the rue du cours at marseilles .: 39.27
<S> it can not be ; surely , valentine , you are mistaken ? no , indeed , i am not ; for i assure you , his power over our household is almost unlimited .: 41.53
<S> ah , is that you , d artagnan , and you , athos ? said the young man .: 10.29
<S> my political opinions ! replied dante s .: 53.64
<S> no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu , and d artagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever .: 41.45
<S> you are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation ; i have become simple in my tastes , and am without passion , i hope .: 43.91
<S> redistribution is subject to the trademark license , especially commercial redistribution .: 22.74
<S> has anyone brought a letter for me ? asked d artagnan , eagerly .: 19.77
<S> these names are too numerous for me to remember them all , and i will content myself with the first , said the queen , graciously .: 28.26
<S> nevertheless , when the name of the king was now and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests , a sort of gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering mouths .: 97.23
<S> he approached the hole he had dug , and now , with the aid of the torch , saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood .: 56.98
<S> you see , your friends are wakeful .: 45.25
<S> buckingham tried to smile a last time ; but death checked his thought , which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love .: 73.01
<S> ah , maximilian , i experienced , at that moment , such remorse for my intention , that , throwing myself at his feet , i exclaimed , forgive me , pray forgive me , my dear grandfather ; they may do what they will with me , i will never leave you . when i had ceased speaking , he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven , but without uttering a word .: 32.38
<S> these were pistols of an especial pattern , which monte cristo had had made for target practice in his own room .: 68.01
<S> the englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation ; and morrel , overwhelming him with grateful blessings , conducted him to the staircase .: 61.75
<S> this child , for whom my poor sister would go to the town , five or six leagues off , to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats , preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves , the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor s orchard , or the dried apples in his loft , when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden .: 102.99
<S> in the midst of the disasters that befell the house , cocles was the only one unmoved .: 43.34
<S> i mean spinach , replied aramis ; but on your account i will add some eggs , and that is a serious infraction of the rule for eggs are meat , since they engender chickens . this feast is not very succulent ; but never mind , i will put up with it for the sake of remaining with you . i am grateful to you for the sacrifice , said aramis ; but if your body be not greatly benefited by it , be assured your soul will . and so , aramis , you are decidedly going into the church ?: 45.16
<S> cambalet , his niece ; while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke all things which appeared to d artagnan monstrous impossibilities .: 170.23
<S> the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon , than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands .: 48.36
<S> we , at least , must keep close to monseigneur ; the rest of the start will rejoin us later .: 57.31
<S> the story has been told by the corsican to some priest , who in his turn has repeated it .: 52.49
<S> now , madame , nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage , said chatillon , who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of athos .: 52.78
<S> yes , indeed , that s the right thing .: 16.52
<S> cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice , said he , and mademoiselle euge nie a splendid soprano , and then she plays the piano like thalberg .: 66.99
<S> oh , very shortly , madame , said he ; but i do not precisely recollect the date of the day .: 21.09
<S> the horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step ; their nostrils reddened like glowing furnaces .: 79.12
<S> at this moment hope makes me despise their riches , which seem to me contemptible .: 63.71
<S> she has near her a certain laporte . who , i believe , is the mainspring of all this , i confess , said the cardinal .: 37.51
<S> has monsieur de beaufort escaped from vincennes ? i do not think so , my lord , said bernouin ; but you will hear about him , for la ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence . tell him to come in , said mazarin , arranging his pillows , so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed .: 31.04
<S> as we said before , by ten o clock almost all the guests had dispersed ; those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve o clock to one at cours la reine .: 61.89
<S> the first sight that attracted the eyes of spada was that of his nephew , in full costume , and c sar borgia paying him most marked attentions .: 84.97
<S> give me the letter . how can you read ? asked athos , it is as dark as a cold oven . wait , said bazin , striking a flint , and setting afire a twisted wax light , with which he started the church candles .: 58.16
<S> then , disguised in the clothes of the marquis d o , he had left the hotel , stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door .: 45.68
<S> he perceived then , at a glance , that this woman was young and beautiful ; and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which d artagnan had hitherto resided .: 59.06
<S> moreover , other ideas , much more enthralling , occupied his mind .: 106.64
<S> why , you must have lost your senses . whether i am in my senses or not , answered franz , that is the way i feel . listen to me , franz , said albert ; i am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you , for i have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count , while he , on the other hand , has always been courtesy itself to us .: 40.18
<S> well , then , madame , not a day passes in which i do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants , all of them automata who do not perceive that i wind up the spring that makes them move , nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured , irritated man , who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days .: 102.72
<S> the governor of the bastile was monsieur du tremblay , the brother of the famous capuchin , joseph , that fearful favorite of richelieu s , who went by the name of the gray cardinal .: 49.04
<S> your treasure ? stammered dante s .: 38.74
<S> yes , my lord . how much were they worth ? why , said porthos , that was very good of him , it seems to me . a thousand pistoles , i said . a thousand pistoles ! porthos exclaimed .: 20.81
<S> where is athos ? in the cellar , monsieur . what , you scoundrel !: 35.67
<S> the poor girl originally possessed much more than that ; she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the thousand and one nights would seem but poverty . she must be a princess then . you are right ; and she is one of the greatest in her country too . i thought so .: 67.32
<S> what is that line ? cried athos , whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demi tints of daybreak .: 72.89
<S> you are right , said the latter ; m .: 10.65
<S> mademoiselle euge nie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress , and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament , unaccompanied by a single jewel .: 64.26
<S> why , it was he who carried me off ! that may be , madame ! and you receive silver from that man ? have you not said that that abduction was entirely political ? yes ; but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress , to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor , and perhaps the life , of my august mistress . madame , replied bonacieux , your august mistress is a perfidious spaniard , and what the cardinal does is well done . monsieur , said the young woman , i know you to be cowardly , avaricious , and foolish , but i never till now believed you infamous ! madame , said bonacieux , who had never seen his wife in a passion , and who recoiled before this conjugal anger , madame , what do you say ? i say you are a miserable creature ! continued mme .: 45.83
<S> for this purpose i applied all the strength i possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which i lay to the adjoining room .: 69.94
<S> i think only that i have known you not a whole year .: 40.91
<S> because that young man , so handsome , so elegant , so polished is a child i have adopted and who does not even know who was his father . very well ; you are always the same , athos , great and generous .: 48.80
<S> i did not even touch your hand , and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repentant . yes , but calumny seized upon all those follies in which i took no part , as you well know , my lord .: 49.40
<S> if once discovered , he knew he would be lost , for the roof afforded no chance of escape ; he therefore resolved to descend , not through the same chimney by which he had come up , but by a similar one conducting to another room .: 71.19
<S> it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room , without either reading or praying .: 127.90
<S> yes , said he , yes , that would flatter me very much ; but i should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction .: 26.65
<S> remember , we are waiting for our turns . speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities , interrupted aramis .: 65.64
<S> peppino pretended not to hear him , and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly .: 54.47
<S> if it is god s justice , instead of his anger , which is walking through that house , maximilian , turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose . morrel shuddered .: 74.72
<S> i shall meet with a victim .: 29.48
<S> her reputation would be lost , it is true ; but of what value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a mercer ?: 45.59
<S> we have made a wager a wager which could not have been foreseen , and of which i defy anyone to divine the true cause .: 55.93
<S> on the contrary , said athos , it must be preserved carefully .: 22.23
<S> eh , eh ! said he , reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy morality of that gallant period , there is one who will be equipped in good time ! porthos , yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator s wife , as a bark yields to the rudder , arrived at the cloister st. magloire a little frequented passage , enclosed with a turnstile at each end .: 55.37
<S> it was never without a nervous shudder , since the dinner at auteuil , and the events which followed it , that madame danglars heard monte cristo s name announced .: 58.58
<S> a council was called on the same evening , but nothing transpired of what had been decided on .: 52.75
<S> whatever command she had over herself , milady could not help starting ; and as in pronouncing the last words lord de winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister , this start did not escape him .: 52.07
<S> listen , my dear , my adored valentine , said he in his melodious and grave tone ; those who , like us , have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world , such may read each other s hearts .: 59.58
<S> what is the matter , sir ? asked monte cristo , advancing to meet the commissioner .: 9.47
<S> he is gone to noisy . how dost thou know ? ah , faith !: 41.08
<S> then the lamp was lighted , and i sat down to table .: 14.42
<S> milady continued : one day our doors will ope , with god come our desire ; and if betrays that hope , to death we can aspire . this verse , into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul , completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer .: 107.78
<S> monte cristo , on stepping into the house , heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob ; he looked in the direction whence it came , and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine,29 with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers , he saw merce de s seated , with her head bowed , and weeping bitterly .: 55.36
<S> i ?: 34.71
<S> the promise it was indeed maximilian morrel , who had passed a wretched existence since the previous day .: 63.05
<S> it was his cornelius nepos that master edward was repeating when he referred to king mithridates , continued the count , and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected him , for your son is really advanced for his years . the fact is , count , answered the mother , agreeably flattered , he has great aptitude , and learns all that is set before him .: 92.28
<S> thanks , my god , said he , at least thou strikest but me alone . a tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic englishman .: 59.02
<S> he stepped forward .: 26.01
<S> d artagnan , my friend , you are brave , you are prudent , you have excellent qualities ; but the women will ruin you ! he came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber .: 39.12
<S> how long you are before you tell me what i most wish to know ? because , in truth , albert you hesitate ? yes , i fear . you fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you ?: 44.18
<S> instead of running after adventures i shall accept an invitation from porthos ; i shall go and shoot on his estate .: 98.16
<S> very good , said the prince , understanding the reason of that ignorance ; the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery ; he might have purchased his life by speaking ; he doesn t wish to speak .: 36.81
<S> it was evening ; i had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which i in my pride pronounced .: 123.74
<S> hallo , dante s !: 47.85
<S> he stood badly with the liberal papers , but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the journalists .: 72.27
<S> i recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch .: 63.70
<S> the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement ; he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him , and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered ; as for franz , he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit .: 59.55
<S> lord de winter thought athos was mad .: 24.49
<S> as to that , said athos , i beg you to believe that i care very little about it .: 20.32
<S> at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night , and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required , and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed .: 68.67
<S> in the first place , let us agree that the word poison does not exist , because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons , which become , according as they are employed , most salutary remedies . what , then , is it ? a skilful preparation of my friend s the worthy abbe adelmonte , who taught me the use of it . oh , observed madame de villefort , it must be an admirable anti spasmodic . perfect , madame , as you have seen , replied the count ; and i frequently make use of it with all possible prudence though , be it observed , he added with a smile of intelligence .: 58.28
<S> help ! no voice replied to hers ; the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity ; the officer seemed a statue .: 94.48
<S> besides , you owe me some thanks .: 37.37
<S> just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door , we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone .: 41.26
<S> have you , by any chance , been in the bastile ? no , madame , i have not ; but very likely i am on the road to it . ah !: 22.59
<S> on , then !: 41.28
<S> no , my friend , i was wrong to caution you ; do not fear , i will bury my grief so deep in my heart , i will disguise it so , that you shall not even care to sympathize with me .: 32.88
<S> it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from buckingham .: 35.18
<S> she arose , came to the table , ate but little , and drank only water .: 51.77
<S> we have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination , who are on their way to her majesty .: 51.07
<S> your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the english army . and if there is a truce the english army has broken it by quitting the town , contrary to the agreement which kept it there .: 55.50
<S> he was received in triumph , as if he came from conquering an enemy and not frenchmen .: 54.61
<S> the old man , who had preserved all his usual coolness , made a sign to him to do so .: 14.05
<S> may i be permitted to inform my wife ? said he .: 26.09
<S> go into my cell as quickly as you can ; draw out one of the feet that support the bed ; you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half filled with a red looking fluid .: 75.85
<S> the coadjutor looked at the queen , who replied by a sign in the affirmative .: 16.35
<S> as i am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed , i went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from it .: 41.21
<S> the jailer stared .: 58.46
<S> what is this ? said aramis , on seeing them arrive .: 18.02
<S> mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him .: 22.12
<S> really , my dear ge rard , you are but a child ; you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you , three days after the landing , the usurper has landed at cannes with several men .: 51.77
<S> instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers , who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor , dante s carefully preserved it , that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live , for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune . then , i suppose , asked caderousse , with eager , glowing looks , that it was a stone of immense value ? why , everything is relative , answered the abbe .: 45.31
<S> the men he beheld saw him undoubtedly , for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind .: 63.42
<S> whilst this terrible scene was passing at lord de winter s , athos , seated near his window , his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand , was listening intently to raoul s account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle .: 34.77
<S> then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum , between the count and vampa , in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino , an engagement which , as our readers are aware , he most faithfully fulfilled .: 48.29
<S> aramis stopped .: 27.23
<S> remember your oath .: 105.85
<S> the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine ; then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels , which enabled him to see into the adjoining room .: 34.84
<S> then not a word , but set to work ! they went on through the darkness , silent as phantoms ; they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees .: 58.45
<S> what would be the use of carrying so much more weight ? was the reply , i can do that when we get there . yes , you re right , replied the companion .: 41.50
<S> madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you . noirtier s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble , while , on the contrary , villefort s eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man s heart .: 30.37
<S> one day , when he arrived with his head in the air , and as light at heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold , he found the soubrette under the gateway of the ho tel ; but this time the pretty kitty was not contented with touching him as he passed , she took him gently by the hand .: 36.11
<S> i know them by their romantic imagination .: 51.76
<S> i hastened to the innkeeper .: 25.15
<S> hold yourself as bolt upright as on the day of the bastion of st. gervais , and do not bow too low to this italian ; that might give him a poor idea of you . good ! answered porthos .: 49.45
<S> supposing , for instance , and do not be angry at what i am going to say well . supposing the assertion to be really true ? a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father s honor . ma foi ! we live in times when there is much to which we must submit . that is precisely the fault of the age . and do you undertake to reform it ? yes , as far as i am personally concerned . well , you are indeed exacting , my dear fellow ! yes , i own it . are you quite impervious to good advice ? not when it comes from a friend . and do you account me that title ? certainly i do . well , then , before going to beauchamp with your witnesses , seek further information on the subject . from whom ? from hayde e. why , what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair ? what can she do in it ? she can declare to you , for example , that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier ; or if by chance he had , indeed , the misfortune to i have told you , my dear count , that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition . you reject this means of information , then ? i do most decidedly . then let me offer one more word of advice . do so , then , but let it be the last . you do not wish to hear it , perhaps ? on the contrary , i request it . do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchamp visit him alone . that would be contrary to all custom . your case is not an ordinary one . and what is your reason for advising me to go alone ? because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp . explain yourself . i will do so .: 52.92
<S> valentine ?: 135.61
<S> read . this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe .: 43.38
<S> he came languidly , placing himself in a good situation to see all the details .: 34.21
<S> merce de s looked pleased and gratified , while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch .: 46.00
<S> i come now to the last of the family , whose secretary i was the count of spada .: 36.57
<S> he began as you begin .: 79.37
<S> wait , said athos .: 11.96
<S> he knows how to crunch fowls , to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night , that s all .: 76.24
<S> well , asked franz , what think you of the count of monte cristo ? what do i think ? said albert , evidently surprised at such a question from his companion ; i think he is a delightful fellow , who does the honors of his table admirably ; who has travelled much , read much , is , like brutus , of the stoic school , and moreover , added he , sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling , that he has excellent cigars . such was albert s opinion of the count , and as franz well knew that albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection , he made no attempt to change it .: 59.86
<S> the count sat down .: 11.21
<S> that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in paris .: 42.42
<S> de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us , doubtless intending to frighten us to death . yes , said villefort , really , count , you frighten the ladies . what is the matter ? asked debray , in a whisper , of madame danglars .: 36.88
<S> let her believe that we are in search of some conspiracy or other .: 34.93
<S> never mind ; let s sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the night . what are we to do , then , to night ? to travel perhaps . but sit down , dear friend , to table .: 42.44
<S> but what are you doing ?: 9.05
<S> all this showed d artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something ; but he could not yet see under this veil .: 39.68
<S> he thought of his wife .: 16.04
<S> i had a bad opinion of him the moment i saw his wound , and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion , too , that death would follow . at the mention of the monk , grimaud became pale .: 38.27
<S> the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room .: 23.18
<S> it will do , replied the man , in a tremulous voice , if you separate them across the neck . the king parted his hair with his hands , and looking at the block he said : this block is very low , is there no other to be had ? it is the usual block , answered the man in the mask .: 33.85
<S> when i am rich i will order a statue of chance from klagmann or marochetti . yes , said morrel , smiling , it was the 5th of september , the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved ; therefore , as far as it lies in my power , i endeavor to celebrate it by some 20237m heroic action , interrupted cha teau renaud .: 46.60
<S> that bonacieux . i have done with him all that could be done .: 52.64
<S> perceiving m. de tre ville at a distance come here , monsieur captain , said he , come here , that i may growl at you .: 34.14
<S> a magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall , ripened by the same artificial heat .: 63.33
<S> you have spurs . yes , but i got down to defend monsieur de comminges and my horse was taken away .: 45.91
<S> this apparition was so strange and so solemn , that everyone rose , with the exception of carlini , who remained seated , and ate and drank calmly .: 47.24
<S> if you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again .: 147.21
<S> at least , d artagnan said to himself , as he took the road to villars cotterets , at least i shall not be alone in my undertaking .: 21.78
<S> listen .: 40.91
<S> la ramee followed all these objects with his eyes , his alarm every moment increasing .: 100.85
<S> but since you abuse my confidence , since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all , then , count of monte cristo my pretended benefactor then , count of monte cristo , the universal guardian , be satisfied , you shall witness the death of your friend ; and morrel , with a maniacal laugh , again rushed towards the pistols .: 70.11
<S> explain yourself more clearly , i beg , sir . oh , make yourself easy ! i am not speaking riddles , and you will soon know what i mean .: 41.18
<S> milady s son , replied athos .: 19.43
<S> you know there are different sorts . that tall , harsh looking man is very learned , he discovered , in the neighborhood of rome , a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have , and he immediately laid his discovery before the institute .: 105.98
<S> why do we hate ?: 41.86
<S> adieu ; or rather , au revoir . the mendicant continued to rip his garments ; and drew from amid his rags a hundred and fifty spanish double pistoles , which he laid down on the table ; then he opened the door , bowed , and went out before the young man , stupefied by his letter , had ventured to address a word to him .: 31.96
<S> i have not time for anybody s affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests ; but i make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers , and he brings them to me as he would the playbills , that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution , he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc . upon my word , that is a most delicate attention on your part , signor pastrini , cried franz .: 56.90
<S> d artagnan started on seeing these tears .: 31.69
<S> what ?: 20.58
<S> now , madame , continued debray , first opening the closet , then the chest ; now , madame , here are 800 notes of 1,000 francs each , resembling , as you see , a large book bound in iron ; to this i add a certificate in the funds of 25,000 francs ; then , for the odd cash , making i think about 110,000 francs , here is a check upon my banker , who , not being m. danglars , will pay you the amount , you may rest assured . madame danglars mechanically took the check , the bond , and the heap of bank notes .: 63.66
<S> he must be retained , or rather he must be left quite alone ; and milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result .: 86.23
<S> and if ever i am reconciled with the court i shall prove to you , i hope , that i remain your friend , as well as that of what the devil are their names d artagnan and porthos ? d artagnan and porthos . ah , yes .: 31.36
<S> the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words .: 93.14
<S> well ? eagerly demanded all his three friends .: 67.87
<S> the cardinal s guards and m. de la tre mouille s people retreated into the ho tel , the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them .: 31.59
<S> some sang ballads about mme .: 141.23
<S> tea , play , and the conversation , which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs , lasted till one o clock in the morning .: 44.06
<S> come , my friend , he said , thrusting his hand through the opening , where are we going ? dentro la testa ! answered a solemn and imperious voice , accompanied by a menacing gesture .: 22.62
<S> well , why should not we , too , belong to a party ?: 42.31
<S> comminges saw that he was undecided .: 37.27
<S> rage supplanted religious fervor .: 515.78
<S> when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped .: 17.06
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> oh , my mother , it was you who said , you were free , you had a beloved father , you were destined to be almost a queen .: 30.07
<S> come , come , said maximilian , i will serve as your guide ; such a man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant .: 27.98
<S> when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of self satisfaction .: 26.86
<S> it was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud anne of austria , and in making himself loved by dazzling her .: 60.39
<S> in ten minutes the masters slept ; not so the servants hungry , and more thirsty than hungry .: 108.00
<S> you must set out for boulogne .: 23.41
<S> to morrow the army of paris will be summoned , the day after it will be here !: 34.13
<S> pray , d artagnan , said athos , after a minute , either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside ; it recalls such cruel recollections that i shall have no head to converse with you .: 48.85
<S> one plan occurred to me , continued albert ; franz likes all that is eccentric ; i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars ; but in spite of four letters , written in the most alluring style , he invariably answered : my eccentricity may be great , but it will not make me break my promise . that is what i call devoted friendship , to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself . albert smiled .: 60.34
<S> let us take our precautions , athos . but suppose they come unarmed ?: 49.69
<S> tis well , and may this money profit you !: 83.93
<S> ah , you philosophize , replied villefort , after a moment s silence , during which , like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent , he took breath ; well , sir , really , if , like you , i had nothing else to do , i should seek a more amusing occupation . why , in truth , sir , was monte cristo s reply , man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope ; but you said , i think , that i had nothing else to do .: 42.11
<S> he then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air , glancing from time to time at the jeweller , who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes , and merely changing his place on the warm hearth , to enable the whole of his garments to be dried .: 55.11
<S> perhaps he will be young , strong , and enduring , like yourself , and will aid you in your escape , while i have been but a hindrance .: 42.57
<S> charming ! said mazarin .: 22.00
<S> this evening , or tomorrow , the cardinal will send someone to take you away . who told you that , my dear ? asked milady .: 27.28
<S> d artagnan went instantly in search of the inn , and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it .: 53.43
<S> in a moment , thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather , she understood that he asked for a key .: 35.55
<S> i feel myself quite in a humor for it ; and i would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of wine . upon my word , the drum draws near , said d artagnan .: 42.20
<S> marie michon and what dream does she mean ? asked the dragoon , who had approached during the reading .: 48.13
<S> if we had been in their place ! yes , they are wrong , said d artagnan .: 17.95
<S> planchet , said d artagnan , i am going out for all day , perhaps .: 20.37
<S> it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoner s feverish imagination .: 29.68
<S> there s something promising , said d artagnan .: 13.02
<S> they were making nearly ten knots an hour .: 50.24
<S> cloud .: 100.96
<S> cucumetto was a cunning fiend , and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent , and this look from teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of eve , and he returned to the forest , pausing several times on his way , under the pretext of saluting his protectors .: 50.78
<S> oh , i would fight for such a cause ; but in return for a slow , profound , eternal torture , i would give back the same , were it possible ; an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , as the orientalists say , our masters in everything , those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities . but , said franz to the count , with this theory , which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause , it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law .: 73.49
<S> at the word notary , noirtier made a sign to her to stop .: 20.98
<S> yes , answered maximilian , but i feel sure he has an excellent heart , and that he likes us . his voice went to my heart , observed julie ; and two or three times i fancied that i had heard it before . chapter 51 .: 33.41
<S> he stretched forth his hand , and touched stone ; he rose to his seat , and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather , very soft and odoriferous .: 40.59
<S> i answer for all that , the prince said .: 29.61
<S> the facchino follows the prince , the transteverin the citizen , everyone blowing , extinguishing , relighting .: 125.73
<S> it was evident that there was clamor and sedition .: 25.17
<S> it is you who , sent by him to constantinople , to treat with the emperor for the life or death of your benefactor , brought back a false mandate granting full pardon !: 103.01
<S> have i the honor of addressing the abbe busoni ? asked the visitor .: 12.76
<S> there can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel ; but for god s sake , do not forget , as you yourself said , athos , that we only write to him concerning a family affair ; that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he will put it out of her power to injure us .: 46.78
<S> here is one , he said .: 14.05
<S> when the hour of breakfast came , therefore , i did not hesitate to eat and drink .: 38.23
<S> very well .: 23.52
<S> they went towards the forest , and soon entered it .: 22.91
<S> the noble and distinguished air of athos , those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself , that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world , that forced and cynical gaiety , that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness such qualities attracted more than the esteem , more than the friendship of d artagnan ; they attracted his admiration .: 102.57
<S> for a half league they proceeded thus , the cannon shot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the balls .: 91.83
<S> he must be apprehended . do not attempt it ; he has revenged himself and has done well .: 44.76
<S> a double line of carbineers , placed on each side of the door of the church , reached to the scaffold , and formed a circle around it , leaving a path about ten feet wide , and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet .: 38.36
<S> i ventured to tell her that mazarin was the lover of anne of austria .: 19.66
<S> can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties .: 28.27
<S> dawn was shedding its pallid , placid glimmer on the purple ocean , when at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass , above which gleamed a triangular sail ; then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save .: 107.86
<S> madame danglars looked at her husband with an expression which , at any other time , would have indicated a storm , but for the second time she controlled herself .: 24.66
<S> one of the bandits rose , and offered him a glass filled with orvietto , saying , to the health of the brave cucumetto and the fair rita . at this moment carlini heard a woman s cry ; he divined the truth , seized the glass , broke it across the face of him who presented it , and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came .: 38.49
<S> there is a struggle in nature against this divine substance , in nature which is not made for joy and clings to pain .: 73.21
<S> the count first reached an open space and franz followed him closely .: 84.80
<S> i had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of morrel son ; these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter , who was to be married in a fortnight , and these two hundred thousand francs were payable , half on the 15th of this month , and the other half on the 15th of next month .: 20.11
<S> i think nothing ; i quote a fact , that is all .: 32.25
<S> monte cristo , thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with morrel and his family , departed , murmuring as he went these lines of pindar , youth is a flower of which love is the fruit ; happy is he who , after having watched its silent growth , is permitted to gather and call it his own . the carriage was prepared according to orders , and stepping lightly into it , the count drove off at his usual rapid pace .: 70.22
<S> have no more concern about me ; i exist no longer for you , any more than if you had never seen me . must aramis do as much as i , madame ? said d artagnan , deeply piqued .: 45.97
<S> these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy . but at any rate , you know where he is , monsieur d artagnan ? asked raoul , somewhat comforted .: 27.25
<S> one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa , without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed , but the young girl had disappeared .: 46.04
<S> shadows ran , as if bewildered , to and fro on the vessel , and mournful cries accompanied these delirious walkers .: 123.79
<S> albert turned away his head with a sigh , and went to his own apartments .: 16.69
<S> but felton did not give him time to draw it .: 23.94
<S> they passed through the gate like apparitions , without the guards thinking of detaining them , and reached the open country .: 73.39
<S> at the first cross street andrea stopped his horse , and caderousse leaped out .: 52.22
<S> he rushed headlong to the street , and like the greek from marathon who fell in the square at athens , with his laurel in his hand , friquet reached councillor broussel s threshold , and then fell exhausted , scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag .: 92.83
<S> the faint glimpses of the pale moon , hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky , whitened the gravel walks that led to the house , but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies , in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery .: 62.40
<S> there were then great griefs , tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithful all of course on the part of the hostess .: 118.32
<S> yes , a base coward , murmured d artagnan ; but she she was very beautiful . what she ? demanded the host .: 29.63
<S> the door is opened to all who knock .: 52.26
<S> in that case , gentlemen , have the kindness to retire into the corners , so as to give us ample room .: 34.30
<S> oh , ours is a theological quarrel , replied aramis , making a sign to d artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel .: 34.65
<S> really ! i might even say that we have some reason to praise him . impossible ! yes , really ; it is owing to him that we are free . owing to him ? yes , he had us conducted into the orangery by monsieur bernouin , his valet de chambre , and from there we followed him to visit the comte de la fere .: 35.27
<S> it would indeed be strange if she checked herself .: 62.63
<S> they locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the night , and left him to himself during the day .: 36.13
<S> and i also , said aramis .: 14.74
<S> then , as in leaving the cabaret they took different directions , my brother went and hid himself on the road of the catholic , and i on that of the huguenot .: 51.09
<S> felton approached her , and said , lord de winter , who is a catholic , like yourself , madame , thinking that the deprivation of the rites and ceremonies of your church might be painful to you , has consented that you should read every day the ordinary of your mass ; and here is a book which contains the ritual . at the manner in which felton laid the book upon the little table near which milady was sitting , at the tone in which he pronounced the two words , your mass , at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied them , milady raised her head , and looked more attentively at the officer .: 54.74
<S> you , madame , have only sought to increase your own , and i am convinced that you have succeeded .: 20.98
<S> yes , the rolling of a carriage . it is the one my brother sends for us . oh , my god ! come , come !: 28.36
<S> assuredly , said d avrigny .: 22.48
<S> this is a woman of twenty six or twenty eight years . fair , said athos , is she not ? very . blue and clear eyes , of a strange brilliancy , with black eyelids and eyebrows ? yes . tall , well made ?: 49.28
<S> we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of grimaud ; if , as we hope , our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work , they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual , who is wholly unchanged , except that he is twenty years older , an advance in life that has made him only more silent ; although , since the change that had been working in himself , athos had given grimaud permission to speak .: 57.85
<S> i supported myself by a chair , feeling that i was about to fall , but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms .: 54.04
<S> take the hundred pistoles , my friend ; take the hundred pistoles ! d artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied .: 26.99
<S> there exist no imprecations she did not pour out against you .: 168.41
<S> a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world , even to a man void of uneasiness ; but for one who has a timid conscience , and with good cause too , the yellow , blue , and white uniform is really very alarming .: 72.25
<S> besides , are you not as anxious to learn news of grimaud , mousqueton , and bazin as i am to know what has become of athos , porthos , and aramis ? yes , monsieur , said planchet , and i will go as soon as you please .: 20.59
<S> what he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond , worth five or six thousand livres , which he wore on his finger ; and even this diamond supposing that d artagnan , in his projects of ambition , wished to keep it , to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the queen had not in the meanwhile , since he could not part with it , more value than the gravel he trod under his feet .: 45.19
<S> the gascon is the devil ! cried athos ; nothing escapes him . the fact is , said porthos , aramis is of the same height , and something of the shape of the duke ; but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a musketeer i wore an enormous cloak , said aramis .: 42.53
<S> a fine and white stocking , a silken robe , a lace kerchief , a pretty slipper on the foot , a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty , but they make a pretty woman beautiful , without reckoning the hands , which gain by all this ; the hands , among women particularly , to be beautiful must be idle .: 112.67
<S> well , be it so ; let me blush for the faults you know , and perhaps perhaps for even more than those !: 63.44
<S> bonacieux , and was , as we have said , close to her , he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief , which he picked up , as was his habit , and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each other s throat .: 33.46
<S> the striking points of his face were effaced ; he had still a nose , but his cheeks , fattened out , each took a portion of it unto themselves ; his chin had joined his throat ; his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks ; his hair , cut straight in holy guise , covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows .: 68.71
<S> do as i bid you : show the chevalier out ; and this evening at eleven o clock you have heard what i said . it appears that these appointments are all made for eleven o clock , thought d artagnan ; that s a settled custom . milady held out her hand to him , which he kissed tenderly .: 51.44
<S> i will say , likewise , he had apprised the count , by a note , of your intention , and , the count being absent , i read the note and sat up to await you . and he will be guillotined , will he not ? said caderousse .: 44.11
<S> the first door , barricaded with furniture , had aroused in him certain suspicions , but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that confusion .: 77.93
<S> much money to be gained ? said bonacieux , protruding his lip .: 88.67
<S> the queen is too virtuous ; and besides , loves your majesty too well . woman is weak , monsieur cardinal , said the king ; and as to loving me much , i have my own opinion as to that love . i not the less maintain , said the cardinal , that the duke of buckingham came to paris for a project wholly political . and i am sure that he came for quite another purpose , monsieur cardinal ; but if the queen be guilty , let her tremble ! indeed , said the cardinal , whatever repugnance i may have to directing my mind to such a treason , your majesty compels me to think of it .: 43.57
<S> provisions began to fail , and whenever one of the prince de conti s generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult , which he put down again , and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues .: 77.42
<S> indeed , sir , i thank you ; you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth . will you permit me , then , to recall another to you ? relating to him ? yes and no . faith ! said madame de chevreuse , say on .: 32.50
<S> he had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when d artagnan returned .: 24.80
<S> really i like him extremely ; is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him ? yes , he is to marry mademoiselle de villefort . indeed ? 30115m and you know i am to marry mademoiselle danglars , said albert , laughing .: 42.00
<S> oh , work , work , my passion , my joy , my delight , it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows ! and he convulsively grasped the hand of d avrigny .: 42.67
<S> she was in tears , and , strange as it was , in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears , he looked also at madame de villefort , and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips , like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky .: 41.52
<S> good god ! asked the poor woman , have i said anything that has wounded you ? no ; but the name struck me , because i also have known that gentleman , and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know him well . oh , yes , very well ; not only him , but some of his friends , messieurs porthos and aramis ! indeed !: 48.63
<S> d artagnan looked , and was seized with pleasure .: 27.01
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> tell me , i entreat you , my dear doctor , that you may be deceived . doubtless i may , but but ? 30345m but i do not think so . have pity on me doctor !: 37.88
<S> no .: 17.05
<S> when my father , with a pistol in his hand , was once on the point of committing suicide , had anyone then said , this man deserves his misery , would not that person have been deceived ? yes ; but your father was not allowed to fall .: 50.53
<S> why should i risk an imprudent step ?: 67.39
<S> on his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him ; he started with delight when , on demanding the name of this young man , he learned that it was louvieres .: 26.80
<S> the foundation s business office is located at 809 north 1500 west , salt lake city , ut 84116 , 801 596 1887 .: 193.45
<S> an inveterate bonapartist ; took an active part in the return from the island of elba .: 69.11
<S> for one second , d artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword ; but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and d artagnan recognized the coadjutor .: 38.52
<S> look ! he said .: 9.67
<S> it was then that d artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeers for without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it .: 53.41
<S> the last count of spada , moreover , made me his heir , bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary , he bequeathed to me all it contained ; no , no , make your mind satisfied on that point .: 63.19
<S> here is m. franz d e pinay , said he ; you requested to see him .: 16.46
<S> it will be even more difficult to descend . d artagnan was about to assure aramis that he could descend easily , when an idea came into his head which silenced him .: 47.74
<S> she will , however , be in the salon in ten minutes . it is a great honor to me , returned monte cristo , to be thus , on the first day of my arrival in paris , brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation , and to whom fortune has for once been equitable , but has she not still on the plains of mitidja , or in the mountains of atlas , a marshal s staff to offer you ? oh , replied morcerf , reddening slightly , i have left the service , monsieur .: 46.55
<S> and do you never use your eyes , which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty , to divine , at a glance , the kind of man by whom you are confronted ?: 66.25
<S> he reflected that this coalition of four young , brave , enterprising , and active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks , fencing lessons , and practical jokes , more or less witty .: 68.82
<S> or he will forget us , added d artagnan .: 18.39
<S> i send them , but like pilate washing my hands . and what does mademoiselle d armilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil ? oh , well , i don t know ; but i understand that she is going to italy .: 44.15
<S> in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search .: 46.92
<S> but one word more , count . what is it ? advice . be careful ; advice is worse than a service . oh , you can give me this without compromising yourself . tell me what it is . is my wife s fortune five hundred thousand livres ? that is the sum m. danglars himself announced . must i receive it , or leave it in the hands of the notary ? this is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly : your two solicitors appoint a meeting , when the contract is signed , for the next or the following day ; then they exchange the two portions , for which they each give a receipt ; then , when the marriage is celebrated , they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance . because , said andrea , with a certain ill concealed uneasiness , i thought i heard my father in law say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now . well , replied monte cristo , it will be the way , everybody says , of trebling your fortune in twelve months .: 63.83
<S> i hope , he whispered to him , that you will follow his majesty s example and not get killed for your folly in this den . set your mind at rest , replied athos .: 56.60
<S> for a time these wings supported him , but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him .: 96.48
<S> porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around .: 72.23
<S> bonacieux had sunk into an armchair , without the power of moving .: 43.80
<S> oh , death , death ! said she , lowering her voice and her eyelids , oh , death , rather than shame !: 28.20
<S> upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes , he found the abbe seated upon a wooden stool , leaning his elbow on a table , while margotin , whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments , had crept up to him , and had established himself very comfortably between his knees , his long , skinny neck resting on his lap , while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller s face .: 81.38
<S> now , whither do you conduct me ? into my room first , replied comminges ; the queen will ultimately decide your place of domicile . athos followed comminges without saying a single word .: 67.76
<S> as to porthos oh , as to porthos , faith , that s a droll affair ! and in spite of himself , the young man began to laugh aloud , looking round carefully , however , to see that his solitary laugh , without a cause in the eyes of passers by , offended no one .: 55.54
<S> you at marseilles ? yes , says he .: 33.37
<S> relate your story , madame , said he , wishing , no doubt , to profit by the absence of the husband , so that the latter could not influence the wife s story , to see if the two recitals tallied .: 42.60
<S> don t waste a charge !: 53.30
<S> a mattress was laid upon the deck for him .: 39.02
<S> the king went straight to him .: 11.11
<S> fortunately , you won t be laid up more than a fortnight .: 46.51
<S> the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended .: 65.61
<S> though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh , bicarat wished to hold out ; but jussac , who had risen upon his elbow , cried out to him to yield .: 87.33
<S> a hundred thousand francs for a fowl ! ah , excellency , you can not imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves ! come , come , this is very droll very amusing i allow ; but , as i am very hungry , pray allow me to eat .: 44.87
<S> i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror ; and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horse s tail , and thus they took me to ni mes .: 57.33
<S> at times there passed before me clouds which pressed my brow , which veiled my eyes ; this was delirium .: 137.03
<S> honor to man , this masterpiece of nature , this king of the creation ! and the count burst into a laugh ; a terrible laugh , that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh .: 71.21
<S> he decided , therefore , not only to fetch the order , but the two thousand pistoles , at which he estimated the prisoners .: 33.91
<S> what do you think of this ? he asked in a low voice .: 6.12
<S> the count , in his survey of the pit , encountered a pale face and threatening eyes , which evidently sought to gain his attention .: 39.72
<S> i stepped into the shed , and it was fortunate i did so , for at that moment caderousse entered with a stranger .: 38.03
<S> in fact , at the end of a few minutes the belfry of st .: 13.47
<S> mazarin especially yes , do you know , i am very glad to hear you give that testimony ; the cardinal has some good in him , and if he were not a foreigner well , he would be more justly estimated .: 49.82
<S> ay , but , said aramis , that young fellow is decidedly a spy . which is the young man ? asked de winter , turning around .: 29.62
<S> and now , demanded the count , are all the forms complied with ? all , sir . have you the keys ? they are in the hands of the concierge , who takes care of the house , but here is the order i have given him to install the count in his new possessions . very well ; and monte cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary , which said , i have no further need of you ; you may go . but , observed the honest notary , the count is , i think , mistaken ; it is only fifty thousand francs , everything included . and your fee ? is included in this sum . but have you not come from auteuil here ? yes , certainly . well , then , it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble , said the count ; and he made a gesture of polite dismissal .: 33.30
<S> then , turning towards ali , he said , let all the horses in my stables be led before the windows of your young lady , that she may select those she prefers for her carriage .: 66.89
<S> caligula or nero , those treasure seekers , those desirers of the impossible , would have accorded to the poor wretch , in exchange for his wealth , the liberty he so earnestly prayed for .: 129.83
<S> porthos !: 41.73
<S> then your grace knows her real name ? asked felton , in a sharp tone .: 38.02
<S> immediately the aldermen , clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants , each holding a flambeau in his hand , went to attend upon the king , whom they met on the steps , where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of welcome a compliment to which his majesty replied with an apology for coming so late , laying the blame upon the cardinal , who had detained him till eleven o clock , talking of affairs of state .: 55.33
<S> i see you are a thoroughly good fellow , and will detain you no longer .: 30.06
<S> opinions held in common are a ready bond of union . read again , said the old man .: 137.32
<S> well ! repeated porthos .: 15.09
<S> exactly , my daughter ; that is precisely what i mean , said danglars , almost digging his nails into his breast , while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man ; ruined yes , that is it . ah ! said euge nie .: 53.02
<S> do not charge a fee for access to , viewing , displaying , performing , copying or distributing any project gutenberg works unless you comply with paragraph 1.e.8 or 1.e.9 .: 7.78
<S> are you not mademoiselle julie morrel ? inquired the man , with a strong italian accent .: 19.54
<S> the only thing that astonished d artagnan was that his friends had never thought of this .: 24.39
<S> command !: 87.55
<S> gentlemen , here is the letter conveyed to me by lord de winter .: 18.76
<S> athos , when he reached his appointed room , observed through the gratings of his window , walls and roofs ; and was told , on inquiry , by comminges , that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where d artagnan was confined .: 45.30
<S> impossible !: 26.49
<S> for master broussel , who is arrested because he has defended the people !: 78.52
<S> the door opened , and monte cristo , turning round , saw albert , pale and trembling , followed by beauchamp and cha teau renaud .: 11.75
<S> the warm pressure made d artagnan tremble , as if by the touch that fever which consumed milady attacked himself .: 98.79
<S> the result of these reflections was that d artagnan , without asking information of any kind , alighted , commended the horses to the care of his lackey , entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone , and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight .: 67.81
<S> do you know about that institution ? i have heard of it . it is a magnificent charity . having said this , the abbe bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies .: 40.26
<S> i am weeping with joy . he was truly crying , but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the pont du gard .: 52.90
<S> we are going , then , we two with our swords , you with daggers .: 53.80
<S> a bell resounded .: 121.66
<S> that did not come from a man without a heart .: 32.80
<S> the king thanked m. de tre ville , and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days , on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place , under penalty of the bastille .: 51.94
<S> yes , said the queen ; but his son ? his son , madame , must be , since the husband of the son s mother is . and your friend has nothing more to ask for madame de longueville ? no , madame , for i presume that the king , standing godfather to him , could do no less than present him with five hundred thousand francs , giving his father , also , the government of normandy . as to the government of normandy , replied the queen , i think i can promise ; but with regard to the present , the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal coffers . we shall search for some , madame , and i think we can find a little , and if your majesty approves , we will seek for some together . what next ? what next , madame ? yes . that is all . haven t you , then , a fourth companion ? yes , madame , the comte de la fere . what does he ask ? nothing . there is in the world , then , one man who , having the power to ask , asks nothing ! there is the comte de la fere , madame .: 34.59
<S> groslow , whom d artagnan s praises had greatly pleased , welcomed him with a gracious smile .: 56.19
<S> in one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money .: 47.75
<S> my faith ! replied d artagnan , you are well named , gentlemen ; and my adventure , if it should make any noise , will prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts . in the meantime , porthos had come up , waved his hand to athos , and then turning toward d artagnan , stood quite astonished .: 44.42
<S> the stranger waved his hand , and continued to descend .: 14.52
<S> heaven grant that this light prove not a devouring fire ! d artagnan , who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with impatience , was beginning to attack the quick .: 91.12
<S> the great man has called me his friend ! yes , my friend , yes , said the cardinal , with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume , but which deceived none who knew him ; and as you have been unjustly suspected , well , you must be indemnified .: 41.76
<S> the heart of d artagnan swam in delirium ; he marched between athos and porthos , pressing them tenderly .: 63.74
<S> the rumor of edmond s arrest as a bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city .: 68.60
<S> come in , gentlemen . d artagnan obeyed ; for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the lord himself .: 49.34
<S> then i must go to the rue st. honore in order to purchase some rouge for madame de chevreuse .: 24.79
<S> i will say do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself ? said bertuccio , in so calm a tone , and with so steadfast a look , that andrea was moved to the very soul .: 32.57
<S> grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys , and the stable boys had beaten him .: 39.91
<S> a loud cry could be heard by her .: 24.62
<S> he did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble , and displayed it with affectation before the queen .: 45.69
<S> have you admired the rapidity of my fall ?: 46.38
<S> what has happened to you today , to raise all these melancholy ideas ? this wound , my dear d artagnan , has been a warning to me from heaven . this wound ?: 45.19
<S> come , said athos , here s another good servant .: 26.10
<S> monsieur de beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison .: 22.19
<S> m. d avrigny carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent , for he was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the mind .: 71.07
<S> i disturb you , perhaps , my dear aramis , continued d artagnan , for by what i see , i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen . aramis colored imperceptibly .: 29.46
<S> in five minutes they gained the land .: 37.34
<S> we are then reconciled , dear monsieur porthos ? said she , simpering .: 49.20
<S> pa te s made by the successor of father marteau are described .: 83.82
<S> who knows what may happen , or how long the attack may last ? in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes , dante s did not lose his presence of mind , but descended into the passage , dragging his unfortunate companion with him ; then , half carrying , half supporting him , he managed to reach the abbe s chamber , when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed .: 52.44
<S> i am not an abbe , i am not mad ; perhaps i shall be , but at present , unfortunately , i am not .: 20.12
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> silence ! but you promised me whispered the poor mercer .: 45.10
<S> yes , monseigneur , said porthos , it is he . monsieur athos , said richelieu , receive my thanks for the good guard you have kept .: 32.55
<S> and you will tell him i will publish the report of bois robert and the marquis de beautru , upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of madame the constable with the queen on the evening madame the constable gave a masquerade .: 51.78
<S> who is he ? the comte de rochefort . the comte de rochefort ! unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i don t know where he is . i know , guitant , said mazarin .: 17.33
<S> some of your people have committed the strangest mistake they have just arrested edmond dante s , mate of my vessel . i know it , monsieur , replied villefort , and i am now going to examine him . oh , said morrel , carried away by his friendship , you do not know him , and i do .: 28.12
<S> do you suppose i carry 100,000 francs in my pocket ? your excellency has 5,050,000 francs in your pocket ; that will be fifty fowls at 100,000 francs apiece , and half a fowl for the 50,000. danglars shuddered .: 55.62
<S> let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other , so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father .: 89.54
<S> she remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise .: 78.86
<S> once beyond saint denis we shall have nothing to fear . grimaud , in fact , brought back five horses .: 75.96
<S> you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both fernand and danglars , in order that i may execute edmond s last wishes . the agitation of caderousse became extreme , and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow .: 36.64
<S> so much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep , that when at seven in the morning bernouin came to arouse him , his first words were : well , what s the matter ?: 67.69
<S> faria , the beneficent and cheerful companion , with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately , no longer breathed .: 61.02
<S> oh , yes , scoundrel !: 16.13
<S> his eye took in at a glance the plump , cheerful countenance of the mistress of the place , and he at once perceived there was no occasion for dissembling with her , or of fearing anything from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy .: 74.57
<S> i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you , who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti poetic impressions and sensations .: 121.15
<S> did you see the president at the minister s last night ? yes . what did he say ? something which will surprise you . oh , make haste and tell me , then ; it is a long time since that has happened . well , he told me that benedetto , who is considered a serpent of subtlety and a giant of cunning , is really but a very commonplace , silly rascal , and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs after his death . bah , said beauchamp , he played the prince very well . yes , for you who detest those unhappy princes , beauchamp , and are always delighted to find fault with them ; but not for me , who discover a gentleman by instinct , and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry . then you never believed in the principality ? yes . in the principality , but not in the prince . not so bad , said beauchamp ; still , i assure you , he passed very well with many people ; i saw him at the ministers houses . ah , yes , said cha teau renaud .: 51.21
<S> reassure yourself , then , and say to yourself : at this moment , a friend , a father , who lives for my happiness and that of maximilian , watches over me ! alas , alas , what a fearful extremity ! valentine , would you rather denounce your stepmother ? i would rather die a hundred times oh , yes , die ! no , you will not die ; but will you promise me , whatever happens , that you will not complain , but hope ? i will think of maximilian ! you are my own darling child , valentine !: 44.10
<S> aramis ! the two musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance , and who answered to the last of these three names , immediately quitted the group of which they had formed a part , and advanced toward the cabinet , the door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered .: 34.68
<S> i let him place the box in the hole he had made , then , while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation , i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast , exclaiming : i am giovanni bertuccio ; thy death for my brother s ; thy treasure for his widow ; thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped . i know not if he heard these words ; i think he did not , for he fell without a cry .: 62.18
<S> marie michon , who made the most charming cavalier in the world , pushed open the door , put her head in and asked for hospitality .: 36.40
<S> poor child ! 40278m chapter 94 .: 48.85
<S> night ! why , for heaven s sake , are your eyes like cats , that you can see to work in the dark ? indeed they are not ; but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions .: 76.26
<S> any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg license as specified in paragraph 1.e.1 .: 12.40
<S> what next ?: 29.33
<S> write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at tours . aramis resumed his pen , reflected a little , and wrote the following lines , which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends .: 57.65
<S> he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed , and wrapped it round him .: 30.52
<S> then he put out his hand , and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore .: 53.79
<S> apply to the steward on the first day of every month , and you will receive the same sum . there now , again you degrade me . how so ? by making me apply to the servants , when i want to transact business with you alone . well , be it so , then .: 52.28
<S> the peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name .: 71.01
<S> you cry very loud , you end by doing nothing ; you talk of flying mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queen s hand led her to the window .: 59.84
<S> oh , what a dreadful event ! cried maximilian .: 17.99
<S> gentlemen , said he , you have heard the comte de morcerf s defence .: 12.39
<S> on entering his ho tel , m. de tre ville thought it best to be first in making the complaint .: 29.49
<S> the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same .: 31.08
<S> you will do me the favor to bring us some spanish wine and then to withdraw .: 36.99
<S> why did you deceive me ?: 18.83
<S> athos , who heard milady s voice , came sharply up .: 65.52
<S> now , let me tell you some news ; euge nie is to be married in a week , and in three days there is to be a grand feast , a betrothal festival .: 31.40
<S> the guests were still at table , and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south , where unhappily , for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling .: 176.79
<S> project gutenberg ebooks may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically anything in the united states with ebooks not protected by u.s. copyright law .: 14.26
<S> what , m. morrel ! said he in a low voice , you send us away ; you are then angry with us ! no , no , said m. morrel , i am not angry , quite the contrary , and i do not send you away ; but i have no more ships , and therefore i do not want any sailors . no more ships ! returned penelon ; well , then , you ll build some ; we ll wait for you . i have no money to build ships with , penelon , said the poor owner mournfully , so i can not accept your kind offer . no more money ?: 42.01
<S> what shall we do ? said athos .: 8.56
<S> two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a corridor in which were three sentinels , opened a door and pushed him unceremoniously into a low room , where the only furniture was a table , a chair , and a commissary .: 62.38
<S> what is going on ? asked franz of the count ; for , as all the talk was in the roman dialect , he had not perfectly understood it .: 26.30
<S> do you see it ? and the man held the torch to the wall .: 18.03
<S> he had not seen morrel .: 18.56
<S> thus d artagnan entered paris on foot , carrying his little packet under his arm , and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means .: 99.19
<S> why did we not destroy the child with the mother ? what need you fear ? said athos , recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced , by the aid of reason ; are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves ?: 66.99
<S> five , answered groslow , one every two hours . d artagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthos s nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive .: 69.55
<S> answer !: 34.30
<S> he entered the chamber and closed the door behind him .: 10.85
<S> the lackeys were ordered to act as sentinels .: 52.38
<S> the people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them .: 71.76
<S> you are in constant communication with the baron danglars ? the count inquired of albert de morcerf .: 41.23
<S> it was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five o clock . was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that i would mention the appointment to no one ? muttered d artagnan .: 47.79
<S> andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances .: 68.99
<S> voices , unheard except on days of revolution , were distinguished ; faces were seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed .: 165.61
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> i must first tell you that monsieur de rochefort is planchet hesitated .: 38.87
<S> bread and salt chapter 72 .: 50.12
<S> in gold , silver , or notes ? half in gold , and the other half in bank notes , if you please , said the count , rising from his seat .: 29.66
<S> felton entered milady s apartment .: 37.22
<S> the scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened ; the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle array .: 67.61
<S> eh ?: 58.00
<S> a knife , which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it , replied felton .: 47.87
<S> they stopped him at the door .: 13.47
<S> should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed , my literary reputation is forever secured . i see , answered dante s .: 86.05
<S> if we release the prisoner thus , we shall never know the truth . athos may always be found , replied tre ville , ready to answer , when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him .: 52.14
<S> they came nobody knew whence ; but when seeing her so lovely and her brother so pious , nobody thought of asking whence they came .: 168.95
<S> on that day , in fact , the four friends arrived punctually at the hour , each from his own abode or occupation .: 37.06
<S> the air he inhaled was no longer pure , but thick and mephitic , he was in prison .: 50.71
<S> i sent them to carry aid to king charles and they performed prodigies to save him ; had it not been for an adverse destiny , that beloved monarch would this day have been among us . but since they served your eminence so well , why are they , my lord cardinal , in prison ? in prison ? said mazarin , and when has rueil been a prison ? ever since there were prisoners in it , answered comminges .: 93.36
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> the two friends , after a cordial pressure of the hands , separated .: 46.80
<S> the door was closed , but i looked through the keyhole , and saw him so pale and haggard , that believing him very ill , i went and told m. morrel and then ran on to merce de s .: 46.60
<S> we are , and have been these ten years , connected with the house of morrel son , of marseilles .: 46.37
<S> madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room .: 22.22
<S> but she has not died of old age , but of grief ; it appears that since the death of the marquis , which affected her very deeply , she has not completely recovered her reason . but of what disease , then , did she die ? asked debray .: 39.54
<S> oh , said aramis , i always try to be prepared ; and then i knew you were seeking me . from whom ? from master bazin , to be sure ; he took you for the devil , my dear fellow , and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers . oh , monsieur ! said bazin , clasping his hands supplicatingly .: 37.97
<S> yes , horse .: 64.39
<S> however , monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali , who , understanding that danger was approaching from the other side , drew nearer to his master .: 37.26
<S> he turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of silence .: 23.77
<S> i bought my experience dearly particularly fair women .: 288.81
<S> the palace rose from the bosom of the water , and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied one s self not in paris , but in venice .: 63.76
<S> then , turning towards albert , it is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern greek , both of which hayde e speaks so fluently ; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian , which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation . the count made a sign to hayde e to address his visitor .: 43.54
<S> in ten minutes d artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate , the points and crossed bars of which were gilt .: 70.87
<S> the young man now knew her secret , her terrible secret the secret she concealed even from her maid with such care , the secret of which all the world was ignorant , except himself .: 67.12
<S> la ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward satisfaction .: 53.58
<S> to nobody in the world . not even to athos or porthos ? i have not breathed a syllable to them . good enough ! tranquil on this important point , aramis continued his way with d artagnan , and both soon arrived at athos s dwelling .: 63.34
<S> for a hundred pistoles i have discovered a secret for which richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns ; without reckoning the value of that diamond he cast a complacent look at the ring , which he had kept , instead of restoring to d artagnan which is worth , at least , ten thousand francs . he returned to his room , and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort , for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones , he called to bernouin to undress him , regardless of the noises of gun fire that , though it was now near midnight , continued to resound through paris .: 57.63
<S> ten minutes afterward mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at rueil ; as he alighted , comminges approached him .: 61.58
<S> monsieur de beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot .: 50.73
<S> the prisoners then approached and formed a circle .: 45.83
<S> the abbe made him smell the contents of the phial , and he again opened his eyes .: 21.24
<S> no , all is over ! said porthos .: 14.46
<S> but today i find you are drawing on mine , and that your apprenticeship may cost me 700,000 francs per month .: 43.18
<S> gaspard , gaspard ! murmured the woman , from her seat on the stairs , mind what you are saying ! caderousse made no reply to these words , though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption , but , addressing the abbe , said , can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself ?: 75.35
<S> d artagnan went up to him ; with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance .: 28.73
<S> there we may learn that as credit sinks , the body becomes a corpse , and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his daughter . but euge nie , instead of stooping , drew herself up under the blow .: 78.48
<S> oh , traitors that ye are ! sire , said athos , this is not a moment for recrimination , but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman .: 38.16
<S> cocles , pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows , said morrel .: 31.05
<S> an explanation at the opera ? said the count , with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good .: 47.91
<S> hate , reproach , the man that has spared my son s life !: 59.09
<S> oh , i wish it you with all my heart ! added caderousse with his hoarse laugh .: 31.12
<S> then when the officer was gone he sat down in the arm chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand .: 41.85
<S> dante s was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend .: 26.76
<S> d artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal .: 50.11
<S> then caderousse sat astride the coping , and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall ; then he began to descend , or rather to slide down by the two stanchions , which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise .: 72.15
<S> don t you see they are trying to catch your eye ? albert turned round , just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness ; as for mademoiselle euge nie , she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage .: 55.77
<S> it appears there is something fresh aboard . aramis , said athos , you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the parpaillot , i believe ? yes . how did you fare ? for my part , i ate but little .: 31.87
<S> morcerf , who ran towards him with open arms , was chilled as he drew near , in spite of the friendly smile , and simply held out his hand .: 27.52
<S> beauchamp the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout paris for the next fortnight .: 130.94
<S> he drank to their good health , and the travelers returned his politeness .: 95.71
<S> no , i feel that i have reached the goal , and i will go no farther .: 16.38
<S> and then our gascon , with that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed , compared himself with de wardes , and asked himself why , after all , he should not be beloved for himself ?: 68.57
<S> emmanuel followed her , and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight half naked sailors .: 84.35
<S> in fact , the blood was rushing to the young girl s head already , her cheeks were becoming red .: 33.79
<S> whom do you bring ? asked the young girl in romaic , of monte cristo ; is it a friend , a brother , a simple acquaintance , or an enemy . a friend , said monte cristo in the same language .: 21.54
<S> two hours passed thus .: 20.67
<S> grimaud came , rubbing his half open eyes , to answer this noisy summons , and d artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to overturn the astonished lackey .: 93.24
<S> certainly , i excuse you , said monte cristo graciously , and pocket them . and he placed the bonds in his pocket book .: 32.54
<S> besides , had not the deputy , who had been so kind to him , told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier , he had nothing to apprehend ?: 47.11
<S> adieu , my friend , adieu ! on the contrary , said the count , after this time you must live with me you must not leave me , and in a week we shall have left france behind us . and you still bid me hope ? i tell you to hope , because i have a method of curing you . count , you render me sadder than before , if it be possible .: 27.47
<S> the story first , sir , said caderousse , you must make me a promise . what is that ? inquired the abbe .: 17.32
<S> the first , that we have not finished breakfast ; the second , that we still have some very important things to say ; and the third , that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the hour . well , then , said aramis , we must form a plan of battle . that s very simple , replied athos .: 33.91
<S> it was many years since d artagnan had opened his heart to any one ; it happened , however , that these two men , on meeting again , assimilated perfectly .: 53.04
<S> well , one can never say what may happen ; at present we and these gentlemen are excellent friends . yes , certainly , added athos and the other two .: 44.30
<S> oh , continued she , placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes , never !: 28.89
<S> a learned italian seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired , dante s almost carried him towards the window , in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating .: 74.90
<S> precautions .: 105.72
<S> yes , replied madame de villefort ; and , would you believe it , count believe what ? you think this house pretty , do you not ? i think it charming . well , my husband would never live in it . indeed ? returned monte cristo , that is a prejudice on your part , m. de villefort , for which i am quite at a loss to account . i do not like auteuil , sir , said the procureur , making an evident effort to appear calm .: 31.94
<S> louise slid through the half open gate like a snake , and bounded lightly forward .: 108.53
<S> but rochefort , who had passed five years in prison , had become old in the lapse of a few years ; the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct cardinal richelieu were now white ; the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility .: 66.33
<S> what , then , are you ? i am about to tell you , wretched man . oh , mon dieu ! i am john francis de winter . i do not know you , said the executioner .: 12.31
<S> i want to be enlightened on a subject ; then , when i shall have learned what i desire to know , i will withdraw . be enlightened ! said athos , phlegmatically .: 35.96
<S> each man had stabbed him separately , and , intoxicated by their crime , though still pale with fear , they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire , after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold .: 82.05
<S> come , we have not any time to lose , it is half past twelve let us set off . all three descended ; the coachman received his master s orders , and drove down the via del babuino .: 33.18
<S> albert , who was a great smoker , and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the cafe de paris , approached the table , and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros .: 48.41
<S> you positively recognize m. de morcerf as the officer , fernand mondego ? indeed i do ! cried hayde e .: 64.95
<S> the apparent reason , at least , said madame de villefort .: 18.13
<S> why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother ?: 59.40
<S> you are madame bonacieux ! the young woman drew back , filled with surprise and terror .: 29.02
<S> porthos maintained a majestic silence .: 95.01
<S> on the evening before , they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at the apartment of the swiss guard , germain , whither d artagnan had sent for her .: 30.41
<S> now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work . look ! said faria , showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long , and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting brush , to the end of which was tied , by a piece of thread , one of those cartilages of which the abbe had before spoken to dante s ; it was pointed , and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen .: 58.42
<S> i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp , who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp ; he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other , he will bring his witnesses , or will insult me in some public place , and i am expected to kill him for all that . you admit that you would fight , then ?: 77.44
<S> they might have been supposed to be following tracks , so observant were they wherever they went .: 73.17
<S> i neither hate nor blame the cardinal , and your opinions will be held ever sacred by me .: 90.75
<S> anne of austria took two steps forward .: 21.36
<S> and now , monsieur du verger , he said , shut yourself up with this man until monsieur bernouin returns to open the door .: 31.34
<S> in the morning at nine o clock , in the day at one o clock , and in the evening at eight .: 14.62
<S> is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words ? oh , my god , no ! said lord de winter , with apparent good nature .: 32.90
<S> i want friends ; i want faithful servants .: 71.04
<S> bonacieux recovered her senses .: 50.01
<S> monsieur grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being , said the servitor , who , little used as he was to such inquiries , began to examine planchet from head to foot .: 94.86
<S> felton , my lad , did you not perceive that you were taken for a novice , and that the first act was being performed of a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following out all the developments ? i thought so , my lord , said felton ; but as the prisoner is a woman , after all , i wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle birth owes to a woman , if not on her account , at least on my own . milady shuddered through her whole system .: 48.02
<S> the donjon of vincennes was considered very unhealthy and madame de rambouillet had said that the room in which the marechal ornano and the grand prior de vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenic a bon mot which had great success .: 101.32
<S> this , however , did not prevent his asking , with the greatest coolness , after his majesty s health .: 25.62
<S> my mistress above all , repeated he , mechanically ; and why her rather than another ? because a mistress is one of the cardinal s favorite means ; he has not one that is more expeditious .: 76.75
<S> noirtier wishes to see you tonight , he said , in an undertone .: 25.21
<S> hence , it resulted when d artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest , he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length , which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard .: 74.03
<S> what for ?: 76.45
<S> who are you , then ? cried all the witnesses of this scene .: 15.18
<S> porthos did the same .: 27.18
<S> parry parted from his friends regretfully ; they had proposed his going with them to france , but he had straightway declined .: 144.13
<S> since that time many things have happened to you .: 21.77
<S> it was aramis who broke the silence .: 33.37
<S> i , as a philosopher , should like a little country house , a cottage down there under the trees , without so many free stones over my poor body .: 92.59
<S> good !: 24.94
<S> i fancy i perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army ; is not that the duc de chatillon himself coming toward us with his brigadiers ? good day , sirs , said the duke , advancing ; you are puzzled by what you see here , but one word will explain everything .: 69.08
<S> oh , god ! prayed the kneeling suppliant , protect my husband , guard my son , and take my wretched life instead ! oh , god ! murmured the girl , leave me my mother ! your mother can be of no use to you in this world , henrietta , said the lady , turning around .: 49.40
<S> your honor ! cried mousqueton , the man you upset is getting up . why didn t thou do as thou didst to the first man ? said porthos .: 40.10
<S> the celebrated cucumetto , pursued in the abruzzo , driven out of the kingdom of naples , where he had carried on a regular war , had crossed the garigliano , like manfred , and had taken refuge on the banks of the amasine between sonnino and juperno .: 53.50
<S> the coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the rue de la monnaie ; there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray , according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie .: 64.60
<S> yes , there is something in what you say ; nevertheless , do not believe that it is madame de longueville with whom i am in love . a plague on t !: 24.40
<S> two words from the hand of your majesty and your private seal . but these two words would bring about my condemnation , divorce , exile ! yes , if they fell into infamous hands .: 87.21
<S> it is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to m. franz d e pinay , not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract , but your own will ? again you drive me to despair , maximilian , said valentine , again you plunge the dagger into the wound !: 63.87
<S> i will tell him of the count , and we shall soon know who he is . take care , returned albert ; no one has been able to accomplish that . oh , we have three millions for our police ; it is true they are almost always spent beforehand , but , no matter , we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this purpose . and when you know , will you tell me ? i promise you .: 29.44
<S> with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud , who followed the little troop , understand everything , and they passed on like a whirlwind , d artagnan still directing them from behind with his voice .: 58.80
<S> if an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the united states and you are located in the united states , we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying , distributing , performing , displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed .: 15.41
<S> fortunately , as we have said , they were within a hundred paces of the city ; they left their two nags upon the high road , and ran toward the quay .: 19.35
<S> bonacieux , who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband .: 38.82
<S> the assassin , finding that he no longer cried out , lifted his head up by the hair ; his eyes were closed , and the mouth was distorted .: 33.20
<S> a vision at four o clock the four friends were all assembled with athos .: 26.73
<S> raoul mounted his horse , and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne .: 30.19
<S> from whom comes this letter ? from her majesty , as i think . from her majesty ! said buckingham , becoming so pale that d artagnan feared he would faint as he broke the seal .: 48.91
<S> pray , try and obtain a small government pension for her . every revolution has its catastrophes , returned m. de villefort ; your brother has been the victim of this .: 56.11
<S> the tutor cried halt ; the young men obeyed , pulling up their steeds , and at the same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gallop .: 35.08
<S> tell him all about it , baron . why , this is the way of it , said the minister , with the gravest air in the world : napoleon lately had a review , and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to france , he gave them their dismissal , and exhorted them to serve the good king . these were his own words , of that i am certain . well , blacas , what think you of this ? inquired the king triumphantly , and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him .: 45.34
<S> yes , count , returned the notary .: 11.36
<S> on arriving at the rue des prouvaires , the curate pointed toward the square before the church .: 33.30
<S> one by one he undid the buttons of his doublet , took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat .: 28.88
<S> sir , said albert , at first with a tremulous voice , but which gradually became firmer , i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m. de morcerf in epirus , for guilty as i knew he was , i thought you had no right to punish him ; but i have since learned that you had that right .: 46.57
<S> after living forty years with the marquis it is not grief , my dear villefort , said the doctor ; grief may kill , although it rarely does , and never in a day , never in an hour , never in ten minutes . villefort answered nothing , he simply raised his head , which had been cast down before , and looked at the doctor with amazement .: 62.27
<S> at this sight the young man stopped short , not in admiration of raphael s picture , but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object .: 44.46
<S> penelon had , it would seem , made good use of his money , for he was newly clad .: 77.10
<S> to be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward .: 90.64
<S> athos looked at them both and took their hands in his .: 41.33
<S> upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act , and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given .: 146.48
<S> ah , yes , it is indeed strange ! and the wretched family departed , leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening .: 43.00
<S> i am saved . yes , said felton ; but silence , silence !: 28.10
<S> on the contrary , replied the count , did you not hear her declare that we were friends ? they re entered the drawing room , which valentine and madame de villefort had just quitted .: 18.94
<S> marie michon , continued athos .: 24.37
<S> no , count , i hope i assure you i shall do my best , stammered villefort .: 23.07
<S> you were not of the party , m. de morcerf ? what prince ? asked albert .: 21.37
<S> but there now take him he is your own for as long as you like .: 62.17
<S> i did my best to make them drunk .: 32.69
<S> when he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning ; and the members of the group , whether rebels or not , as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal , at once gave place to the patrol .: 44.42
<S> monsieur laporte , said d artagnan , go and announce to the people through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king , but they shall see him in bed ; add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence , so as not to awaken him . but not every one ; a deputation of two or four people . every one , madame . but reflect , they will keep us here till daybreak . it shall take but a quarter of an hour , i answer for everything , madame ; believe me , i know the people ; they are like a great child , who only wants humoring .: 53.68
<S> we have already observed with what rapidity d artagnan seized the expression of a countenance .: 28.72
<S> he did not dare to write for fear of not being able to such experienced eyes as those of milady to disguise his writing sufficiently .: 74.48
<S> the council of the musketeers chapter xlviii .: 22.11
<S> everyone had just seen it pass ; it was only five hundred , two hundred , one hundred steps in advance ; at length they reached it , but it was not the friend .: 28.06
<S> that was a noble example to follow , monsieur . why , replied danglars , not entirely so ; with the servants , you understand . i see ; to your domestics you are my lord , the journalists style you monsieur , while your constituents call you citizen . these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government .: 127.10
<S> sire , buckingham has been in paris five days , and only left this morning . chapter xvi .: 43.45
<S> all is ready , sire , said he .: 15.55
<S> then when she had no longer any doubt , she cried , in a state of stupor , what , my brother , is it you ? yes , fair lady ! replied lord de winter , making a bow , half courteous , half ironical ; it is i , myself . but this castle , then ? is mine . this chamber ? is yours . i am , then , your prisoner ? nearly so . but this is a frightful abuse of power ! no high sounding words !: 49.32
<S> i wish them to be promulgated immediately . but , my lord , if the lord chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure , what shall i reply ? that such is my pleasure , and that i answer for my will to no man . will that be the answer , replied the secretary , smiling , which he must transmit to his majesty if , by chance , his majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of great britain ? you are right , mr. jackson , replied buckingham .: 58.97
<S> that i might the sooner see you again , my dear father , replied the young man .: 20.78
<S> the author of this history , who has resided five or six years in italy , does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries .: 49.08
<S> i must return to the minister s .: 16.97
<S> before daybreak m. de wardes must take his departure , still in obscurity .: 94.95
<S> d artagnan pursued his way .: 18.91
<S> shall i drive you back to paris ? he asked .: 20.25
<S> a deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene described .: 52.42
<S> the first object that met the eyes of d artagnan on entering the room was brisemont , stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions .: 47.27
<S> you had no pity for that youthfulness , that beauty , that weakness ?: 74.39
<S> athos made no reply .: 12.68
<S> give us the clergy and the people , of whom you can dispose , and i will bring you the citizens and the parliament ; with these four elements paris is ours in a week ; and believe me , monsieur coadjutor , the court will give from fear what it will not give from good will . it was now the coadjutor s turn to fix his piercing eyes on louvieres .: 67.37
<S> you who are in power have only the means that money produces we who are in expectation , have those which devotion prompts . devotion ! said villefort , with a sneer .: 132.16
<S> as d artagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to porthos , and as he was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends , he held out his hand to the wounded man , and told him he was about to resume his route in order to continue his researches .: 20.76
<S> shall i send the father to you ? immediately . very well . the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies , and took their leave , albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars contempt , monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a banker s wife should exercise in providing for the future .: 48.19
<S> that ?: 86.68
<S> as being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him . i don t call those friends who betray and ruin you , murmured the wife in her turn , in a low , muttering voice .: 77.55
<S> this man , who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mob not a muscle of whose face was stirred , either at mazarin s witticisms or by the jests of the multitude seemed to the cardinal a peculiar being , who , having participated in past events similar to those now occurring , was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place .: 133.71
<S> i beg a thousand pardons , said the count , there is nothing the matter , but i slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my elbow .: 37.40
<S> according to the laws of dueling at that period , d artagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased .: 38.79
<S> where you please , returned monte cristo , since i know nothing at all of it . i thought the abbe busoni had told your excellency . some particulars , doubtless , but that is seven or eight years ago , and i have forgotten them . then i can speak without fear of tiring your excellency . go on , m. bertuccio ; you will supply the want of the evening papers . the story begins in 1815. ah , said monte cristo , 1815 is not yesterday . no , monsieur , and yet i recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but then .: 40.56
<S> then mine is the boat you want , sir .: 52.09
<S> but beneath my fingers , as if by magic , in proportion as the fire ascended , i saw yellowish characters appear on the paper .: 73.41
<S> all at once great cries resounded in the pavilion , and a woman came to the window , and opened it , as if to throw herself out of it ; but as soon as she perceived the other two men , she fell back and they went into the chamber .: 18.23
<S> he fancied for a moment that he had been shot , and listened for the report ; but he heard nothing .: 22.15
<S> beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited albert , and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days .: 49.19
<S> then the count brought the taper to the window , that it might be seen in the champs e lyse es that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light .: 29.15
<S> moreover , from being so long in twilight or darkness , his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night , common to the hyena and the wolf .: 63.95
<S> her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother .: 75.59
<S> while the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it , felton untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound milady s hands together .: 85.24
<S> i was told there were such at the last exhibition . he has simply a mahogany secretaire , in which the key is always kept . and he is not robbed ? no ; his servants are all devoted to him . there ought to be some money in that secretaire ? there may be .: 58.07
<S> bonacieux , when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone ; that imbecile lacked but one thing : to become a cardinalist .: 66.32
<S> i am hungry , feed me ; i am bored , amuse me . it is my duty as your host , returned albert , ringing the bell , while lucien turned over , with his gold mounted cane , the papers that lay on the table .: 53.56
<S> if i am an officer , your fortune is certain , for i shall have money enough for both , and , moreover , a name we shall both be proud of , since it will be our own .: 42.64
<S> i faith , yes , said athos , for i am hungry . look out for the black fowls ! cried aramis .: 27.99
<S> we have undergone a great deal of fatigue , remember , and a little rest will do no harm . i rest ?: 56.45
<S> we went to take monsieur athos to the waters of forges , where my friends still remain . and you have returned , have you not ? replied m. bonacieux , giving to his countenance a most sly air .: 38.92
<S> this late arrival had attracted much suspicion , and the young man being no other than andrea , the commissary and gendarme , who was a brigadier , directed their steps towards his room .: 83.87
<S> how ? asked blaisois , i can ?: 32.93
<S> the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the foundation or pglaf , owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg electronic works .: 10.35
<S> yes ; see , i send a ball into the moat ; a man is there who picks it up ; the ball contains a letter .: 67.19
<S> you mistake , he said , providence does exist , only you have never seen him , because the child of god is as invisible as the parent .: 45.54
<S> then sitting down by the fire , my supper , said he ; my expedition has given me an appetite . well done , carlini ! cried the brigands ; that is acting like a good fellow ; and they all formed a circle round the fire , while diavolaccio disappeared .: 49.58
<S> the young man knew quite well that , after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father , great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping ; but he did not know that matters had reached such a point .: 50.32
<S> we will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you are . just as you please , gentlemen , provided we set sail , he said .: 32.46
<S> we shall go together , shall we not ? said albert to the count .: 18.95
<S> but the excitement had calmed down , and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality ; after having exhausted the ideal , they found they must talk of the actual .: 78.10
<S> courage ! he whispered to porthos , as they proceeded .: 20.52
<S> the world is a sepulcher ! alas , you will find it so yourself , said aramis , with a sigh .: 18.42
<S> read , said the old man .: 10.20
<S> the 28th of february . in what year ? in what year you ask me in what year ? yes , replied the young man , i ask you in what year ! you have forgotten then ? i got such a fright last night , replied dante s , smiling , that i have almost lost my memory .: 33.96
<S> it is not he !: 12.99
<S> she opened her eyes , looked around her with terror , saw that the apartment was empty and that she was alone with her liberator .: 26.62
<S> she opened , and found the word secret . ah !: 89.82
<S> he must be made to speak , in order that he might be spoken to for milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice , which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language celestial .: 74.76
<S> the fair indian , astonished at the sensation her observation produced , looked down and resumed her air of naivete .: 146.95
<S> all eyes were turned for a moment towards the procureur , who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a corpse .: 41.43
<S> i can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine looking fellow admirably dressed .: 73.34
<S> go to the parliament , for it was from this parliament , the enemy of monarchs , that the daughter of the great , the sublime henry iv. , whom you so much admire , received the only relief this winter which prevented her from dying of hunger and cold ! and with these words henrietta rose in majestic indignation , whilst the cardinal , raising his hands clasped toward her , exclaimed , ah , madame , madame , how little you know me , mon dieu ! but queen henrietta , without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions , crossed the cabinet , opened the door for herself and passing through the midst of the cardinal s numerous guards , courtiers eager to pay homage , the luxurious show of a competing royalty , she went and took the hand of de winter , who stood apart in isolation .: 75.56
<S> she descended , and went through the passage .: 24.71
<S> the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to athos .: 45.25
<S> you do not know her , replied the stranger .: 9.52

<S> this was to go himself to m. de la tre mouille .: 16.09
<S> now , said mordaunt , are you not afraid that they will recognize you ? there is no danger , dressed as i am in this pilot coat , on a night as dark as this .: 50.60
<S> believe me , you ought now to take a rest .: 37.39

<S> old enough to be ambitious , but too young to be corrupt .: 84.88
<S> this account confirmed that of the mayor .: 67.54
<S> is it , then , to mademoiselle valentine de villefort that you leave these 900,000 francs ? demanded the notary , thinking he had only to insert this clause , but waiting first for the assent of noirtier , which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene .: 53.61
<S> good god ! added the wounded man , in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder ; you will not allow that ?: 30.00
<S> at nine o clock the contract is to be signed at my father in law s. ah , indeed ? said monte cristo .: 20.21
<S> without a blush , men made their way in the world by the means of women blushing .: 71.37
<S> at length providence has done something for you ; he restores to you more than he takes away , and it was time i should die . edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim , oh , my friend , my friend , speak not thus ! and then resuming all his presence of mind , which had for a moment staggered under this blow , and his strength , which had failed at the words of the old man , he said , oh , i have saved you once , and i will save you a second time ! and raising the foot of the bed , he drew out the phial , still a third filled with the red liquor .: 40.34
<S> aramis went off at once , begging athos not to remain alone within reach of d artagnan and porthos ; a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile .: 50.41
<S> what made you choose a house at the gates of paris , m. bertuccio ? i , cried the steward with a strange expression .: 32.72

<S> as night closed in they arrived at thirsk .: 161.00

<S> she gave the first to athos and the other to aramis , so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king ; after which they withdrew .: 63.86
<S> mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket , and tying a knot at each corner the signal agreed upon waved it in the air and the man came up to him .: 48.86
<S> the red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel s keel , floated at the foot of the crag .: 41.87
<S> it was there that my father , ruined by the revolution , and m. danglars , who never had possessed any patrimony , both laid the foundations of their different fortunes . yes , said monte cristo i think m. danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him ; and , continued he , casting a side glance at lucien , who was turning over the leaves of an album , mademoiselle euge nie is pretty i think i remember that to be her name . very pretty , or rather , very beautiful , replied albert , but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate ; i am an ungrateful fellow . you speak as if you were already her husband . ah , returned albert , in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing .: 40.60
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> yes , i inherited this little property when i quitted the army , as i told you .: 30.34
<S> i was pretty drunk yesterday , d artagnan , said he , i can tell that by my tongue , which was swollen and hot this morning , and by my pulse , which was very tremulous .: 38.18
<S> never mind !: 22.85
<S> just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk . but as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced : touch it not ! grimaud ! he cried ; grimaud !: 76.67
<S> it is only five minutes past eight , said he to morrel ; there is not much time lost yet . oh , i made no allusion of that kind , replied morrel .: 26.16
<S> the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade , worked with flowers of gold .: 53.37
<S> speak to the governor , then . and where is the governor ? in the country . anger mounted to d artagnan s face ; he frowned and his cheeks were colored .: 39.72
<S> no , replied the latter .: 7.08
<S> leave me ! she exclaimed ; you are not a man ! and she went out of the room .: 11.04
<S> and from this time the kindness which edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman .: 78.92
<S> see the sneaks come , without drum or trumpet .: 108.13
<S> how comes it , that having both a sister and an adopted son , you have never spoken to me of either ? 20323m alas , i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life .: 76.96
<S> he had himself a daughter about her age , but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive .: 93.81
<S> he extended his hands , and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock .: 51.30
<S> the count appeared , dressed with the greatest simplicity , but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet .: 51.45
<S> i set off for france , after having fixed upon the plan .: 38.47
<S> that one ? yes , the third . the one in the dark blue coat ? yes . he is a colleague of the count , and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the chamber of peers with a uniform .: 44.62
<S> the duke waited until midnight , turning on his mattress like st. laurence on his gridiron .: 124.83
<S> the cardinal made a sign to his attendant , who drew near .: 14.80
<S> d artagnan , d artagnan ! cried she ; remember that i loved you ! the young man rose and took a step toward her .: 17.36
<S> so throwing himself back in his armchair , he said , with an arrogant and purse proud air : let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes ; you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars , however limited , are still equal to meeting the largest demands ; and were you even to require a million i beg your pardon , interposed monte cristo .: 84.69
<S> the three friends burst into laughter .: 29.89
<S> all is over . but , said athos , who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king ? an amateur headsman , replied aramis , who however , does not handle the axe amiss . did you not see his face ? asked athos .: 37.88
<S> monsieur de beaufort made the experiment a third time , but by this time pistache s patience was exhausted ; he threw himself furiously upon the cane , wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his teeth .: 36.65
<S> m. coquenard , firm upon his legs , would have declined all relationship with m. porthos .: 69.43
<S> i merely ask you , did you not refuse to go to brussels for the queen , whilst you had consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal ? that is the very reason i refused to go back to brussels .: 37.90
<S> the woman is an agent of the cardinal . he has agents , then , throughout the world ? cried d artagnan .: 26.73
<S> copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change .: 43.19
<S> i was most anxious to see you . but it must have vexed m. morrel , good , worthy man , said caderousse .: 36.87
<S> well , try the hotel de luynes , raoul , and ask if the duchess can receive you .: 38.87
<S> he therefore dined very silently , in spite of the officious attention of his host , who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything .: 32.96
<S> and you really understand none of these signals ? none at all . and have you never tried to understand them ? never .: 52.51
<S> it is not a question of the past , but of the present , said the queen ; you said you could give me advice what is it ? madame , said the chancellor , hesitating , it would be to release broussel . the queen , although already pale , became visibly paler and her face was contracted .: 33.81
<S> morrel looked attentively on villefort .: 47.05
<S> and why , when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed , might he not also be ?: 67.73
<S> i will therefore proceed .: 22.04
<S> all that the prudent planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of d artagnan , who looked at him with more attention than he had done before .: 31.17
<S> that is not all , sir , continued mazarin ; your private adventures have touched me to the quick ; besides , the letter from mr. cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador ; come , tell me , what can i do for you ? mordaunt reflected a moment and , after some hesitation , was about to speak , when bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal , whispered : my lord , the queen henrietta maria , accompanied by an english noble , is entering the palais royal at this moment . mazarin made a bound from his chair , which did not escape the attention of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make .: 45.10
<S> have you provided yourself with money ?: 45.37
<S> the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity ; his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face .: 68.72
<S> ah , i am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for it . the marquis of saint me ran ! returned the count .: 23.44
<S> as long as the procurator s wife could follow him with her eyes , she waved her handkerchief to him , leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself .: 31.95
<S> at length , happier than the young man , who sobbed without weeping , tears glistened in the eyes of noirtier .: 42.37
<S> i have always said to you , i love you as a brother ; but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection , for my heart is another s. is not this true , fernand ? yes , that is very true , merce de s , replied the young man , yes , you have been cruelly frank with me ; but do you forget that it is among the catalans a sacred law to intermarry ? 0045m you mistake , fernand ; it is not a law , but merely a custom , and , i pray of you , do not cite this custom in your favor .: 45.12
<S> the wise man , my child , has said , it is good to think of death . well , if you die , said she , bequeath your fortune to others , for if you die i shall require nothing ; and , taking the paper , she tore it in four pieces , and threw it into the middle of the room .: 28.99
<S> but the chevalier was himself at heart a frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation .: 138.61
<S> you may copy it , give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at www.gutenberg.org .: 8.75
<S> does your excellency wish for a receipt ? said the major , at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat .: 26.00
<S> perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m. de villefort ; but , like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign , he dwelt in an impregnable fortress .: 47.90
<S> here is madame returning with monsieur . d artagnan looked out and at the corner of rue montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous swiss , who tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend porthos .: 87.96
<S> but as lord wilmore , in the character of the count s enemy , was less restrained in his answers , they were more numerous ; he described the youth of monte cristo , who he said , at ten years of age , entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english .: 46.35
<S> he then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard ; but it appeared the servant did not find him .: 45.67
<S> every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart .: 134.47
<S> at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments , where a bath and supper were prepared .: 41.73
<S> come , my friends . a moment s delay , said athos ; our servants ? here we are ! they cried .: 35.41
<S> the substitution was made so carefully that my spies , if i had any , could have no suspicion of it .: 68.07
<S> the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire , and to ali to follow to his study , where they conversed long and earnestly together .: 30.37
<S> that same evening , upon reaching his abode in the champs e lyse es , the count of monte cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner .: 48.26
<S> but as m. de toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemy s camp for a fresh assault , the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair , and gave the necessary orders for a decisive action .: 62.42
<S> yes , on the contrary , they met , and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man . athos , in his turn , rising without speaking , went and unhooked his sword .: 27.68
<S> it is you who sold us , my mother and me , to the merchant , el kobbir !: 25.46
<S> the minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses , felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed france from the inveterate enemy who set all europe against her .: 142.26
<S> he immediately called d artagnan .: 22.65
<S> was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us ?: 132.70
<S> making a sign to la houdinie re and cahusac to stop , he alighted from his horse , and went toward these suspected merry companions , hoping , by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach , to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting .: 90.81
<S> imponite manus , and not manum place the hands , not the hand . place the hands , repeated the curate , with a gesture .: 159.68
<S> on the twenty eighth of october , 1628 , the capitulation was signed .: 19.17
<S> yes , monseigneur , replied the officer .: 7.65
<S> poor king !: 28.76
<S> i would arrest ten of them , ventrebleu , a hundred , even , all the company , and i would not allow a whisper . from the moment they are suspected by your majesty , said tre ville , the musketeers are guilty ; therefore , you see me prepared to surrender my sword for after having accused my soldiers , there can be no doubt that monsieur the cardinal will end by accusing me .: 60.81
<S> however fugitive this homicide flash , felton saw it , and started as if its light had revealed the abysses of this woman s heart .: 73.47
<S> a prisoner ? he reiterated .: 44.01
<S> this evening , you said . well , this evening will come , thank god !: 28.88
<S> the poor girl promised all her lover desired ; she was mad .: 51.13
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> it is edmond and merce de s ! ah , see there , now ! said caderousse ; and i did not recognize them !: 22.24
<S> scarcely had they reached by the rue de la mule the iron gate of the place royale , when they perceived three cavaliers , d artagnan , porthos , and planchet , the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden , and planchet , his musket by his side .: 45.66
<S> about a year ago , i talked of retiring to a convent .: 48.36
<S> the name is not unknown to me ; the marquis of saint me ran ! and he appeared to meditate .: 25.71
<S> they say joy never hurts , and so i came to you without any warning .: 105.89
<S> when i first came here ; being the last comer , it was for me to make the first advances .: 61.43
<S> the man of meung the crowd was caused , not by the expectation of a man to be hanged , but by the contemplation of a man who was hanged .: 28.84
<S> i could never agree to it . still , you have thought of it ? incessantly , alas ! cried the abbe .: 25.84
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> but the young man had begun to follow , or rather to advance before the boat .: 24.45
<S> that is forbidden , it seems to me . where forbidden ? asked mousqueton .: 28.59
<S> this harsh letter , coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful , struck a mortal blow at the pride of villefort .: 108.72
<S> calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen , the abbe opened it , and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained , set in a ring of admirable workmanship .: 82.36
<S> behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames ; great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room , which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with wax lights .: 194.49
<S> euge nie !: 21.71
<S> it is god s pleasure that things should be so . the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village , so called , situated between salon and lambesc ; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation , her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine , which , in all probability , his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce .: 70.14
<S> i have heard that name in greece . in conjunction with the affairs of ali pasha ? exactly so . this is the mystery , said danglars .: 27.97
<S> they think of me in their pleasures , as i thought of them in my troubles .: 41.61
<S> day gilded the tops of the houses .: 91.04
<S> peppino followed danglars .: 70.96
<S> proud of this exploit , vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders , and carried him to the farm .: 54.31
<S> still further , in spite of sword thrusts which weaken , and painful exercises which fatigue , he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of revels , one of the most insinuating lady s men , one of the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day ; the bonnes fortunes of de tre ville were talked of as those of m. de bassompierre had been talked of twenty years before , and that was not saying a little .: 68.52
<S> gaetano , said he to the captain , you tell me monte cristo serves as a refuge for pirates , who are , it seems to me , a very different kind of game from the goats . yes , your excellency , and it is true . i knew there were smugglers , but i thought that since the capture of algiers , and the destruction of the regency , pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat . your excellency is mistaken ; there are pirates , like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii. , and who yet , every day , rob travellers at the gates of rome .: 63.71
<S> here s one , your honor how the devil hast thou two horses ? asked d artagnan , jumping on one of them .: 39.86
<S> the return .: 49.86
<S> but be assured , my dear monsieur d artagnan , that if i had obtained them from any other source , or if they had been confided to me , there exists no confessor more discreet than myself . oh , i don t doubt that , replied d artagnan ; but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms a certain embroidered handkerchief , for instance , to which i owe the honor of your acquaintance ? this time aramis was not angry , but assumed the most modest air and replied in a friendly tone , my dear friend , do not forget that i wish to belong to the church , and that i avoid all mundane opportunities .: 39.98
<S> in a few minutes , through all the doors , down all the staircases , by every exit , everyone hastened to retire , or rather to fly ; for it was a situation where the ordinary condolences , which even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastrophes , were seen to be utterly futile .: 64.52
<S> see , said beauchamp , pointing out morrel to debray .: 32.16
<S> as to your rank , an annual income of 50,000 livres will enable you to support it admirably .: 41.59
<S> i am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth , and shall be happy if you will accompany me , viscount . willingly . then it is settled ? yes , but where ? i have told you , where the air is pure , where every sound soothes , where one is sure to be humbled , however proud may be his nature .: 66.13
<S> you shall want for nothing , and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault . at these words he retired .: 32.36
<S> you seemed at dinner to be anxious about something . i was trying , said porthos , to recall where i had seen that mendicant whom i must have killed . and you couldn t remember ? no . well , search , my friend , search ; and when you have found , you will tell me , will you not ? pardieu ! said porthos .: 38.45
<S> think of it , madame , he said ; if , on my return , justice has not been satisfied , i will denounce you with my own mouth , and arrest you with my own hands ! she listened , panting , overwhelmed , crushed ; her eye alone lived , and glared horribly .: 38.03
<S> give me those papers , and leave us . the officer took from the table the papers pointed out , gave them to him who asked for them , bowed to the ground , and retired .: 35.36
<S> come , come , said danglars , tapping his fingers against the door , i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat ! but whether he did not understand him , or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars , the giant , without answering , went on with his dinner .: 30.26
<S> the procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice .: 45.19
<S> i have not yet had time to see him again .: 14.03
<S> this is a kind of usury , banker , that i do not understand . take all , then take all , i tell you , and kill me ! come , come , calm yourself .: 33.57
<S> no , no , dear d artagnan , said the figure , tis not the devil , tis aramis ; gallop fast , planchet , and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the left . and planchet , with aramis behind him , set off at full gallop , followed by d artagnan , who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic dream .: 36.05
<S> dead animosities .: 52.86
<S> come , said he to himself , be a man .: 12.67
<S> my terror overcame me to such a degree as i approached the thicket , that i took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself .: 48.97
<S> we will not expose your eminence to the chances of war . come , answered mazarin , i see it will be necessary for me to capitulate . before a siege ? yes ; the conditions will be better than afterward . ah , my lord !: 34.51
<S> he could not do this , he whose past life was so short , whose present so melancholy , and his future so doubtful .: 79.59
<S> he therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of lens , determined beforehand to act with or against the court , as his congratulations were well or ill received .: 78.51
<S> you may one day be the captain of a vessel .: 37.09
<S> two hours after , all was over ; we had done the business of both , admiring the foresight of our poor father , who had taken the precaution to bring each of us up in a different religion . well , i must allow , as you say , your father was a very intelligent fellow .: 44.70
<S> d artagnan lost no time in useless compliments .: 35.84
<S> on the eve of battle .: 12.28
<S> there is someone , then , concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting , said de winter , in an ironical , contemptuous tone .: 68.93
<S> bonacieux s .: 40.73
<S> the noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the cha teau is built , reached dante s ear distinctly as they went forward .: 47.65
<S> beauchamp , announced the servant .: 42.77
<S> oh , had he been my own son , replied bertuccio , or even my nephew , i would have brought him back to the right road , for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength , but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed , made it impossible for me to punish him .: 51.97
<S> and now , raoul , said the gascon , monsieur du vallon and i are going away as ambassadors , where , i know not ; but should you want anything , write to madame turquaine , at la chevrette , rue tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker with economy ; for it is not so well filled as that of monsieur d emery . and having , meantime , embraced his ward , he passed him into the robust arms of porthos , who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant .: 62.02
<S> stop ! and the sergeant , who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice , was almost in a frenzy of despair .: 25.98
<S> days , even months , passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course .: 237.24
<S> a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview , and therefore he had suggested it .: 45.18
<S> ah , come in , come in , monsieur d artagnan ! cried the cardinal , and welcome your friend too .: 20.56
<S> i know it , monsieur ; everything is turned topsy turvy in the world nowadays . while this dialogue was going on , the two young men and the poor lackey descended .: 51.53
<S> the thieves had already approached andrea , some screaming , la savate la savate ! 26 a cruel operation , which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace , not with an old shoe , but with an iron heeled one .: 93.08
<S> doubtless , although less evident , monte cristo s joy was not less intense .: 42.74
<S> in 43 , he said , just before the death of the late cardinal , i received a letter from athos .: 27.06
<S> i desire to know if the confession of charles stuart is at an end ? said the stranger .: 35.28
<S> their number was great .: 103.66
<S> i wished to make an effort ; i attempted to cry out .: 27.18
<S> section 1 .: 33.41
<S> low born fellows ! ejaculated porthos .: 97.94
<S> one thing i was sorry for ; when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded , he told me there would not be time , as it would require three days to do that ; so you see we must do without this little superfluity . and where is he now ? who ? our host . gone out in search of our equipage , by tomorrow it might be too late . then he will be able to give us an answer tonight . oh , i expect him every minute . at this instant the door opened , and the head of signor pastrini appeared .: 50.89
<S> 22 literally , the basket , because wedding gifts were originally brought in such a receptacle .: 330.24
<S> if i mistake not you are an admirer of paintings , at least i judged so from the attention you appeared to be bestowing on mine when i entered the room .: 73.88
<S> the contract was read during a profound silence .: 35.83
<S> monte cristo examined him with the same look that , at rome , he had bent upon the execution of andrea , and then , in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward the abbe busoni , then told me an untruth , said he , when , after his journey in france , in 1829 , he sent you to me , with a letter of recommendation , in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities .: 40.48
<S> he had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master .: 29.47
<S> why did you not have him arrested while in paris ? arrest the duke !: 34.54
<S> oh , my god ! said mme .: 5.71
<S> oh , my god , thou knowest whether i am guilty !: 19.44
<S> azure seven merlets , or , placed bender , said he .: 116.24
<S> you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre , that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made .: 115.57
<S> ah , indeed ? said cavalcanti .: 13.90
<S> on the morning of the departure from the forest of frosinone he had followed carlini in the darkness , and heard this oath of vengeance , and , like a wise man , anticipated it .: 35.09
<S> oh , oh ! said andrea , you need not be ashamed , even though you did post after me .: 42.82
<S> it appeared to the young man that the guards , on seeing him depart , chuckled among themselves .: 44.00
<S> the king s request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign , for in firm , sonorous accents , which vibrated in the depths of athos s heart , the king began his speech , explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom .: 80.85
<S> i understand , said monte cristo ; you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion ? ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions .: 67.69
<S> having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him , aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces .: 104.75
<S> has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony ? then indeed we are lost ! cried the queen , in the fullness of a broken heart .: 47.55
<S> if i find you alive on my return , you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie . madame de villefort sighed ; her nerves gave way , and she sunk on the carpet .: 48.32
<S> the elder prisoner pondered the matter .: 84.50
<S> d artagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver .: 36.66
<S> they were hungry , and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory , and your tars are not very ceremonious .: 60.82
<S> really , my dear count , you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned ; when i listen to you , existence no longer seems reality , but a waking dream .: 56.45
<S> terror recalled me to myself .: 118.53
<S> do i ?: 44.91
<S> they have , perhaps , some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm .: 77.34
<S> i have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from ni mes who had set up a little tavern on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire . yes , said monte cristo i perfectly recollect him ; i think he was your colleague . precisely , answered bertuccio ; but he had , seven or eight years before this period , sold his establishment to a tailor at marseilles , who , having almost ruined himself in his old trade , wished to make his fortune in another .: 39.44
<S> there were large bottles filled with serpents , ticketed according to their species ; dried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood , and bunches of wild odoriferous herbs , doubtless possessed of virtues unknown to common men , were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the corners of the apartment .: 94.05
<S> the sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass , and called his sergeant .: 48.56
<S> well , sir , replied euge nie , i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come , i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible . but , said danglars , whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic , marking evident premeditation and force of will , what is your reason for this refusal , euge nie ?: 43.68
<S> every man has a devouring passion in his heart , as every fruit has its worm ; that of the telegraph man was horticulture .: 91.26
<S> help , comrades , help ! by a rapid movement , which the gendarme s practiced eye had perceived , dante s sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea ; but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat .: 62.54
<S> however , i have turned the business over to morcerf , so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you ; for my own part , i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings . 30093m i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32,000 francs , wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000 francs each . he seems to have a mania for diamonds , said morcerf , smiling , and i verily believe that , like potemkin , he keeps his pockets filled , for the sake of strewing them along the road , as tom thumb did his flint stones . perhaps he has discovered some mine , said madame danglars .: 99.12
<S> you will , i trust , excuse me , monsieur , for not calling you by your title when i first addressed you , he said , but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government , and that i am myself a representative of the liberties of the people . so much so , replied monte cristo , that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count . upon my word , monsieur , said danglars with affected carelessness , i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions ; but the fact is , i was made baron , and also chevalier of the legion of honor , in return for services rendered , but but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs. de montmorency and lafayette ?: 64.09
<S> once upon a time there lived a queen a powerful monarch who reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe ; and a minister ; and this minister wished much to injure the queen , whom once he had loved too well .: 75.88
<S> dear maximilian , believe me when i assure you that if i do not attempt to resist my father s commands it is more on your account than my own . but why , valentine , do you persist in anticipating the worst , why picture so gloomy a future ? because i judge it from the past . still , consider that although i may not be , strictly speaking , what is termed an illustrious match for you , i am , for many reasons , not altogether so much beneath your alliance .: 63.18
<S> but what have you done ? asked franz .: 7.62
<S> she returned to louise , took up the portmanteau , which she had placed for a moment on the ground , and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall .: 24.88
<S> alas , i would say you are welcome , had not death opened the way for you into this house . valentine , said morrel with a trembling voice , i had waited since half past eight , and did not see you come ; i became uneasy , leaped the wall , found my way through the garden , when voices conversing about the fatal event what voices ? asked valentine .: 70.82
<S> arriving at the window parry found an unfinished scaffold , over which they were nailing a covering of black serge .: 82.59
<S> bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience , mingled with uneasiness ; he hoped for some compliments , while , at the same time , he feared to have frowns .: 45.29
<S> it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life .: 32.07
<S> before closing the door he turned around once more , and said , not a movement not a word ; let them think you asleep , or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you . and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door , which noiselessly closed after him .: 48.80
<S> there is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house , the only title i desire with respect to you ; there is not one , in fact , who would have dared to speak of me as i have spoken of them this day .: 26.43
<S> i must wait .: 23.16
<S> are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadness ? why , we can not tell .: 84.56
<S> all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of signor pastrini s ; the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting .: 48.72
<S> are you going ? added she to comminges .: 31.05
<S> he has gone , said he , and the house door is shut . he has gone to make his report , and to say that all the pigeons are at this moment in the dovecot . well , then , let us all fly , said athos , and leave nobody here but planchet to bring us news . a minute .: 39.86
<S> the chamber cuts down their salaries every day , so that now they have scarcely any .: 102.78
<S> this can not be the establishment of athos .: 23.84
<S> on perceiving the cavaliers , d artagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh ; besides , his horse , he found , had a carbine on the bow of the saddle .: 47.92
<S> the outlook was sad .: 58.06
<S> andrea shuddered , and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor .: 45.15
<S> try , therefore , either to carry me to some place where i may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here .: 61.70
<S> your mother will add to them a recipe for a certain balsam , which she had from a bohemian and which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that do not reach the heart .: 77.86
<S> that s well ! said athos , filling his glass and that of his friend ; here s to porthos and aramis !: 25.73
<S> we did better than that , sir , said the old sailor respectfully ; we put the helm up to run before the tempest ; ten minutes after we struck our top sails and scudded under bare poles . the vessel was very old to risk that , said the englishman .: 76.48
<S> pardon me , monsieur , but you are not my lord the duke of buckingham , said mme .: 18.67
<S> the cardinal s hair stood on end .: 16.42
<S> she rather feared that her preceding operations in england might have been discovered .: 110.95
<S> all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets , or silence their exclamations , were in vain .: 68.33
<S> he appears cool .: 57.87
<S> a french nurse , who sent me away when i was five years old because no one paid her for me , telling me the name of a relation of whom she had heard my mother often speak . what became of you ? as i was weeping and begging on the high road , a minister from kingston took me in , instructed me in the calvinistic faith , taught me all he knew himself and aided me in my researches after my family . and these researches ? were fruitless ; chance did everything . you discovered what had become of your mother ? i learned that she had been assassinated by my relation , aided by four friends , but i was already aware that i had been robbed of my wealth and degraded from my nobility by king charles i. oh !: 81.42
<S> i shall seek , not mazarin , but the queen , and say to her , madame , restore to us your two servants and our two friends . aramis shook his head .: 42.16
<S> you , who are accustomed to the palaces of italy , can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in paris can live .: 87.64
<S> those two men were the count de rochefort and the mendicant of saint eustache .: 15.71
<S> the president rang the bell .: 16.46
<S> the queen and her minister , more especially the latter , had reason to feel anxious .: 39.27
<S> he had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours .: 43.13
<S> look at monsieur mouston , see the honorable wounds he has received , observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance . mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced d artagnan had he dared ; meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself .: 91.41
<S> how does it happen that you are in paris ? rochefort ! cried the two friends .: 18.48
<S> sir , you know well i would risk my life for you . thou mayst add that thou hast risked it , planchet .: 54.80
<S> bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of d artagnan .: 19.81
<S> the prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to grimaud , who turned away his head .: 35.74
<S> i have told you that i am prepared for anything . the two travelers knocked at the door .: 13.73
<S> a burst of laughter was the answer , but finished with a groan .: 34.01
<S> now let us everyone retire to his own home , said d artagnan , as if he had done nothing but command all his life ; and attention !: 40.99
<S> planchet , grimaud , bazin , and mousqueton presented themselves , and received clear , positive , and serious orders from athos .: 88.95
<S> these thoughts , gilded as they were by a last reflection of love , were not the less sad .: 64.39
<S> she made it her business , therefore , to amuse the good abbess with the worldly practices of the court of france , mixed with the eccentric pursuits of the king ; she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the lords and ladies of the court , whom the abbess knew perfectly by name , touched lightly on the amours of the queen and the duke of buckingham , talking a great deal to induce her auditor to talk a little .: 50.36
<S> d artagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it .: 29.45
<S> the general fell , then , in a loyal duel , and not in ambush as it might have been reported .: 51.24
<S> shows how with threat and pen more is effected than by the sword .: 247.56
<S> athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside , and to make them a sign to come and listen with him .: 26.52
<S> and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars , or barrels of brandy without a permit .: 116.91
<S> d artagnan mounted the staircase , followed by his prisoner , who in his turn was followed by the soldier , and entered mazarin s ante room .: 21.19
<S> for pity s sake ! cried the young man , whose agony drawn breath at times , when his head went under water , under the wave , exhaled and made the icy waters bubble .: 75.11
<S> overturn the world , change its character , yield to mad ideas , be even criminal but live . count , i have your word , said morrel coldly ; then taking out his watch , he added , it is half past eleven . morrel , can you intend it in my house , under my very eyes ? then let me go , said maximilian , or i shall think you did not love me for my own sake , but for yours ; and he arose .: 58.58
<S> hold , sir , said villefort , do not prolong this dreadful scene .: 22.18
<S> d avrigny accosted the priest .: 39.41
<S> to saddle , gentlemen !: 39.24
<S> six of his eminence s guards arrest six of his majesty s musketeers !: 46.04
<S> i was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves .: 32.34
<S> the cab crossed the pont neuf and entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphine ; the driver was paid as the door opened , and stepping lightly up the stairs madame danglars soon reached the salle des pas perdus .: 69.53
<S> a very respectable lady , said aramis .: 26.19
<S> however proud you may be , you will not refuse to accept one of them , and to request your three companions to accept the others that is , in order to make war against us .: 44.29
<S> the moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road .: 57.44
<S> scarcely was the captain s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone , and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the island of elba , instead of making for marseilles direct . 0025m as to taking command of the vessel , replied morrel , that was his duty as captain s mate ; as to losing a day and a half off the island of elba , he was wrong , unless the vessel needed repairs . the vessel was in as good condition as i am , and as , i hope you are , m. morrel , and this day and a half was lost from pure whim , for the pleasure of going ashore , and nothing else . dante s , said the shipowner , turning towards the young man , come this way ! in a moment , sir , answered dante s , and i m with you . then calling to the crew , he said , let go ! the anchor was instantly dropped , and the chain ran rattling through the port hole .: 55.36
<S> why , i meant to pass it over to you , my dear athos . me !: 39.69
<S> and grandpapa has become my physician , and i have the greatest confidence in him , because he knows everything . do you then really suffer ? asked morrel quickly .: 36.73
<S> monte cristo approached him , and said in a low voice , with an expression almost humble : sir , you have indeed lost a son ; but villefort interrupted him ; he had neither listened nor heard .: 39.84
<S> mousqueton !: 63.29
<S> argumentum omni denudatum ornamento .: 147.47
<S> and how ? by the queen s almoner , to whom i am very intimately allied , said aramis , coloring .: 30.47
<S> raoul , angry and at the same time uneasy , ran after him and seized him by the arm .: 36.67
<S> villefort , after having received m. de salvieux s letter , embraced rene e , kissed the marquise s hand , and shaken that of the marquis , started for paris along the aix road .: 62.18
<S> she likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you . ah , said buckingham , god be praised !: 43.69
<S> yes . what do you hope ? the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer .: 15.26
<S> nevertheless , whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young man s road , our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident , and alighted at the tavern of great st. martin , the same at which they had stopped on their first journey .: 51.80
<S> but when i added to the gun an english cutlass with which i had shivered his highness s yataghan to pieces , the bey yielded , and agreed to forgive the hand and head , but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in tunis .: 107.49
<S> the superior met her ; milady showed her the cardinal s order .: 52.75
<S> maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word .: 36.89
<S> he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there ; the dish of beans had disappeared .: 49.10
<S> tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband , and although i am only your brother in law , i will arrange one similar . my first husband ! cried milady , looking at lord de winter with eyes almost starting from their sockets .: 43.64
<S> why , about ten or eleven o clock . shall we watch by the corpse ? of what use would it be ?: 57.43
<S> the funeral being over , the guests returned to paris .: 41.98
<S> dante s was almost glad of this affray , and almost pleased at being wounded , for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger , and with what endurance he could bear suffering .: 89.43
<S> well , asked he , as soon as they were by themselves , tell me what it is ? an affair of the greatest importance , that demands my immediate presence in paris .: 31.85
<S> two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door , which was made of three planks ; the door had never been painted or varnished , so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on .: 123.12
<S> faria had now fully regained his consciousness , but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed .: 96.64
<S> the surgeon declared that the situation of the musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy , his weakness having been purely and simply caused by loss of blood .: 74.83
<S> ali , cried he , striking at the same time on the brazen gong .: 34.20
<S> however , because i was prudent you must not take me for a fool .: 39.80
<S> after dinner , the play . monte cristo looked inquiringly at his guests .: 45.02
<S> moses , the servant of god he was but a servant , please to understand moses blessed with the hands ; he held out both his arms while the hebrews beat their enemies , and then he blessed them with his two hands .: 96.04
<S> the abbess assigned her a chamber , and had breakfast served .: 74.35
<S> with being an agent of the bonapartist faction ! many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated .: 107.52
<S> athos was meditating ; porthos was twisting his mustache ; aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little book of hours , bound in blue velvet .: 99.64
<S> yes , replied caderousse , little albert . but , then , to be able to instruct her child , continued the abbe , she must have received an education herself .: 40.50
<S> some highlanders were listlessly keeping watch .: 226.02
<S> the bandit s laws are positive ; a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off , then the rest draw lots for her , and she is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings .: 106.14
<S> incendiary !: 107.47
<S> since , the evening before , he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the thousand and one nights , and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto .: 41.89
<S> i am glad to see , said d artagnan , that you have still that honest lad with you . he is my steward , replied porthos ; he will never leave me .: 19.28
<S> there will be extenuating circumstances , he replied .: 47.05
<S> what is the matter , my lord ? said athos , and what puts you out of breath thus ? nothing , replied de winter ; nothing ; and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me and he again turned round .: 32.13
<S> everyone knows that drunkards and lovers have a protecting deity .: 190.86
<S> had his majesty , asked he , any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday ? no , your excellency , replied the valet de chambre , the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag .: 50.71
<S> the court of anne of austria was full of gayety and animation ; for , after having gained a victory over the spaniard , it had just gained another over the people .: 44.48
<S> hold , hold , hold ! said athos , wit his quiet tone ; that throw of the dice is extraordinary .: 73.11
<S> should you not have known me again , in spite of my eight and forty years of age ? on the contrary , i do not find you the same person at all . i understand , cried athos , with a gentle blush .: 20.56
<S> i have already often told you of this ; you must not forget it , for it is a great defect in a rider .: 27.18
<S> that s it !: 16.35
<S> there go two miscreants ; said he , it is a pity they are not really related ! then , after an instant of gloomy reflection , come , i will go to see the morrels , said he ; i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred . 30147m chapter 57 .: 85.77
<S> the turnkey closed the door behind them .: 21.41
<S> he had given his word not to watch mme .: 28.52
<S> someone has told you the secret ; or , perhaps , you guessed that he was here . that who was here ? your child your son your andrea ! i did guess it , replied the major with the greatest possible coolness .: 67.90
<S> i give you 45,000 francs that is , 2,500 livres of income , a fortune such as i wish i had myself , and you are not satisfied ! and the five and forty thousand francs , inquired caderousse in a hoarse voice , where are they ?: 46.29
<S> this done , instead of leaving the door fastened , he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar , as though he had left the room , forgetting to close it , and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise , after replacing the chimney board , which represented achilles with deidamia , and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes , he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel , which afforded him the only means of escape left .: 76.00
<S> finally , the prince led the right wing , resting on aunay .: 104.05
<S> my funds are deposited there , and you can understand that if i draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor .: 45.02
<S> when he had fixed his piercing look on this modern babylon , which equally engages the contemplation of the religious enthusiast , the materialist , and the scoffer , great city , murmured he , inclining his head , and joining his hands as if in prayer , less than six months have elapsed since first i entered thy gates .: 82.11
<S> it was indeed for him that they were there .: 18.38
<S> there were but three ho tels in this part of the street ; and only two windows looking toward the road , one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which aramis occupied , the other belonging to aramis himself .: 54.88
<S> with all my heart .: 30.88
<S> we were in the palace of yanina ; she snatched me from the cushions on which i was sleeping , and on opening my eyes i saw hers filled with tears .: 44.58
<S> i swear to heaven , on the contrary , that if they fall upon him i will fall upon them . and i , too , said porthos .: 19.31
<S> bicarat was a gascon , as d artagnan was ; he turned a deaf ear , and contented himself with laughing , and between two parries finding time to point to a spot of earth with his sword , here , cried he , parodying a verse of the bible , here will bicarat die ; for i only am left , and they seek my life . but there are four against you ; leave off , i command you . ah , if you command me , that s another thing , said bicarat .: 65.32
<S> he was convinced that lucien s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity , the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chausse e d antin .: 45.22
<S> section 2 .: 36.23
<S> are there , then , two parliaments ? my friend , d artagnan interrupted , as i don t understand english and we all understand spanish , have the kindness to speak to us in that language , which , since it is your own , you must find pleasure in using when you have the chance . ah !: 41.37
<S> as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor , he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there ; but he received for reply , that the person in question had got into difficulties , and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire .: 68.19
<S> at ten o clock the guns of the louvre announced the departure of the king , and then a movement , similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops , ran though the multitude , which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard .: 68.31
<S> do you require my services now ? asked d avrigny .: 17.50
<S> you ? and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before him .: 33.19
<S> i have nothing to give you , my son , but fifteen crowns , my horse , and the counsels you have just heard .: 29.80
<S> he was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target , when his study door opened , and baptistin entered .: 62.00
<S> i confess i can discover no other safe and satisfactory way . let us see , said aramis , how are we to act ? i have arranged two plans .: 53.25
<S> well , this man was making signs to another at my left , and turning around i recognized the honest grimaud .: 76.61
<S> can i not , like pasta , malibran , grisi , acquire for myself what you would never have given me , whatever might have been your fortune , a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum , for which i shall be indebted to no one but myself ; and which , instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs , with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality , will be accompanied with acclamations , with bravos , and with flowers ?: 55.36
<S> yes , indeed , count , said madame danglars ; and tell me , did you ever see at the court of ali tepelini , whom you so gloriously and valiantly served , a more exquisite beauty or richer costume ? did i hear rightly , monsieur , said monte cristo that you served at yanina ? i was inspector general of the pasha s troops , replied morcerf ; and it is no secret that i owe my fortune , such as it is , to the liberality of the illustrious albanese chief . but look ! exclaimed madame danglars .: 44.22
<S> d artagnan , not less forward than they , did likewise , and all ran out , in order to repair to their posts .: 43.29
<S> it was about nine o clock in the morning .: 5.85
<S> the tumult was indescribable .: 49.70
<S> when arrived there , the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all .: 58.08
<S> explain yourself , my lord , i am listening . the queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to saint germain . aha ! said d artagnan , that is to say , the queen wishes to leave paris . a woman s caprice you understand . yes , i understand perfectly , said d artagnan .: 18.57
<S> it was not your opinion that i asked , said the queen , sharply , without even turning around .: 36.89
<S> yes , said albert , blushing .: 10.67
<S> he recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there ; but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto .: 46.84
<S> the party was to take place at st. germain , i believe , and they had appointed to meet at the carmes deschaux , when they were disturbed by de jussac , cahusac , bicarat , and two other guardsmen , who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts . ah , ah !: 63.02
<S> what ?: 20.58
<S> i guessed it !: 33.00
<S> and now leave me , monsieur bertuccio , to walk alone here in the garden .: 30.44
<S> i might have gone up to him and killed him .: 27.93
<S> milady smiled , and d artagnan felt that he could damn himself for that smile .: 26.02
<S> they dragged us away by force .: 88.30
<S> i like men of head and heart .: 91.19
<S> a fine name , said morrel .: 20.34
<S> life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a smile .: 101.59
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> here i am ! exclaimed porthos .: 13.54
<S> she took me away without speaking .: 25.54
<S> you are not an enemy of our holy faith ? said she , hesitatingly .: 39.37
<S> and she assumed , upon sitting up in the armchair , a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she reclined .: 107.45
<S> colonel , pay my respects to the officer of yours who struck that blow . yes , said harrison , laughing , and looking over at one of the officers seated at his table .: 67.82
<S> he hit him but once , but as he had foretold , that hit was a mortal one ; the sword pierced his heart .: 78.22
<S> where are your musketeers ?: 26.23
<S> the cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his study .: 22.92
<S> my dear athos , i wish , as your health absolutely requires it , that you should rest for a fortnight .: 53.48
<S> i am of your opinion , but find me a better one or give me the means of living . athos was for a few moments thoughtful .: 31.79
<S> his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself , and he will deliver the official order to the officer , who , in his turn , will hand it to the executioner ; in the meantime , it will be as well to acquaint peppino with what we have determined on , if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses , because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred . your excellency , said the man , you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you , are you not ? nay , i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it , replied the cavalier in the cloak .: 48.69
<S> those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave .: 55.60
<S> at the bois de boulogne , ennui and hunger attacked me at once , two enemies who rarely accompany each other , and who are yet leagued against me , a sort of carlo republican alliance .: 74.57
<S> yes , count , and charged with a commission for which i beg of you to accept my excuses . what is it ? be so good as to give me up your sword , count . athos smiled and opened the window .: 29.62
<S> athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine .: 48.91
<S> accused , said the president , your name and surname ? andrea arose .: 51.02
<S> i know nothing .: 18.08
<S> the physician has a sacred mission on earth ; and to fulfil it he begins at the source of life , and goes down to the mysterious darkness of the tomb .: 55.27
<S> so we followed him through the lowest streets in the city , and in half an hour s time he stopped before a little isolated house .: 34.17
<S> the old man returned alone to his home , folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes , and paced up and down his chamber the whole day , and would not go to bed at all , for i was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night ; and for myself , i assure you i could not sleep either , for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness , and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast .: 44.67
<S> i have never seen her from that day .: 23.58
<S> it was at perugia on corpus christi day , in the garden of the ho tel des postes , when chance brought us together ; you , madame de villefort , and her son ; i now remember having had the honor of meeting you . i perfectly well remember perugia , sir , and the ho tel des postes , and the festival of which you speak , said madame de villefort , but in vain do i tax my memory , of whose treachery i am ashamed , for i really do not recall to mind that i ever had the pleasure of seeing you before . it is strange , but neither do i recollect meeting with you , observed valentine , raising her beautiful eyes to the count .: 43.97
<S> viscount , your countenance , your goodness and your courage incline me toward you ; my gratitude is already due .: 74.80
<S> the young man , wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview , questioned the new comer ; but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to m. emmanuel , and that his business was with m. morrel in person .: 33.17
<S> he will never see you again ; all is over .: 22.88
<S> they are two hotheads the one a gascon , the other from picardy ; both are easily excited , but they quiet down immediately .: 98.30
<S> begone , then ! d artagnan saluted m. de tre ville , who held out his hand to him ; d artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude .: 20.63
<S> yes , murmured flamarens , lowering his eyes .: 20.47
<S> you lie ! it cried .: 59.28
<S> those who have read the memoirs of mme .: 36.27
<S> now that i expect nothing , now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes , the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity . and he remained again motionless and thoughtful .: 63.61
<S> i should think so , but not without difficulty .: 37.45
<S> what , monseigneur ? said d artagnan , with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself .: 15.58
<S> he made morrel wait in the antechamber , although he had no one with him , for the simple reason that the king s procureur always makes everyone wait , and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers , he ordered m. morrel to be admitted .: 44.58
<S> ho !: 16.63
<S> inquiry was made , and it was ascertained that , by a strange coincidence , this carriage contained the corpse of the marquis de saint me ran , and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two .: 47.92
<S> listen : there were in truth , at that epoch , four devoted hearts , four loyal spirits , four faithful swords , who saved more than my life my honor ah !: 106.49
<S> yes , madame , replied the magistrate .: 7.04
<S> i should find myself , therefore , more at my ease , facilius natans , in a subject of my own choice , which would be to these hard theological questions what morals are to metaphysics in philosophy . d artagnan began to be tired , and so did the curate .: 62.70
<S> continue , and say what we must do now . monsieur laporte , said d artagnan , finish dressing his majesty . we may go , then ? asked the queen .: 27.89
<S> may i hope , sir , said madame de villefort , that your intentions accord with my request ? noirtier made a sign that they did .: 25.84
<S> in ten minutes after the strangers had departed , franz was on the road to the piazza di spagna , listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by albert , after the manner of pliny and calpurnius , touching the iron pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators .: 86.15
<S> some day , when the world is much older , and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive powers in nature , to serve for the general good of humanity ; when mankind , as you were just saying , have discovered the secrets of death , then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arms of your beloved . and if you wished to die , you would choose this death , count ? yes . morrel extended his hand .: 62.11
<S> except that which i ask of you , dear love . but when i assure you that you may rely on my tenderness ? i can not wait till tomorrow . silence !: 37.11
<S> m. de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france .: 55.06
<S> yes . what to do ? noirtier made no answer .: 28.75
<S> a year after , madame . well ? i wanted to see the good cure again .: 49.55
<S> if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement , you must obtain permission in writing from the project gutenberg literary archive foundation , the manager of the project gutenberg trademark .: 9.21
<S> he was to wait at the gate ; if by chance the musketeers should appear , the carriage was to set off as fast as possible , pass around the convent , and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood .: 34.16
<S> at two o clock i shall have the honor of expecting you at the ho tel of monsieur de tre ville .: 10.16
<S> you are late . general , i wished to see the ceremony to the end , which delayed me . ah !: 45.32
<S> the steward could not restrain himself .: 14.48
<S> the life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral , especially when , by taking it away , he could increase the sum total of his own desires .: 70.76
<S> there is nothing compromising in the name of a town .: 29.76
<S> a crowd of masks flowed in from all sides , emerging from the doors , descending from the windows .: 60.02
<S> 24 fre de rick lemai tre french actor 1800 1876 .: 748.40
<S> come !: 17.12
<S> come , come , said he , will the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly ?: 54.30
<S> let me be on my guard . and he assumed a look of stupidity which mendori or bellerose , two of the first actors of the day , might have envied .: 52.27
<S> the king was closeted with the cardinal , and m. de tre ville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment .: 16.80
<S> and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms .: 18.78
<S> the count ! cried a young voice that made athos start .: 29.38
<S> pardon , gentlemen par murmured the voice , which could now only be heard in inarticulate sounds .: 110.17
<S> they will be ten times worse off in a week . ah , yes !: 37.43
<S> i assure your excellency , said he , that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things , and i will take m. ali as my model . by no means , replied the count in the most frigid tones ; ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities .: 53.94
<S> excuse my putting such a question to you . it is not indiscreet , returned morcerf , with the simplicity of conviction .: 35.55
<S> serpent , muttered d artagnan , i would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name . aramis opened the paper , and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read d artagnan . the gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to mordaunt : i hope , sir , said he , you have no objection to make . none , whatever , replied the other , drawing his sword and resting the point on his boot .: 42.82
<S> no , i grieve not on my own account , i shall always find a resource ; my books , my pencils , my piano , all the things which cost but little , and which i shall be able to procure , will remain my own .: 48.79
<S> alas , monsieur , said she , that is too bad . what the devil do you see so bad in it ? said d artagnan .: 15.19
<S> madame , you are deceived , said porthos ; she is simply a duchess . and that running footman who waited at the door , and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat ? porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage , but with the eye of a jealous woman , mme .: 61.85
<S> d artagnan , leaning on athos , made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms , who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others .: 38.23
<S> locusta chapter 102 .: 86.94
<S> without doubt he recognized d artagnan , for he became deadly pale ; doubtless the musketeer knew him , for his hair stood up on his head .: 34.89
<S> what is it ? cried many persons present .: 36.55
<S> villefort s only answer was a stifled groan .: 48.90
<S> well , my dear porthos , said d artagnan , that s the very thing it came into my head to do . athos understood all now .: 26.81
<S> what do you want ? something to drink . your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near rome . then give me water , cried danglars , endeavoring to parry the blow .: 70.30

<S> poor child !: 18.06
<S> on being left alone with mme .: 51.47
<S> soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave , formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat .: 62.38
<S> the officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst d artagnan was looking at bazin ; he pronounced the words of the holy sacrament and retired , giving the benediction , which was received by the kneeling communicants , to the astonishment of d artagnan , who recognized in the priest the coadjutor himself , the famous jean francois gondy , who at that time , having a presentiment of the part he was to play , was beginning to court popularity by almsgiving .: 92.13
<S> i , said aramis , in his most flutelike tone , i had made up my mind .: 19.06
<S> you need give yourselves no more uneasiness about this . d artagnan is right , said athos ; here are our three leaves of absence which came from monsieur de tre ville , and here are three hundred pistoles which came from i don t know where .: 36.53
<S> it is my soul that must be saved ; as for my body , it is lost . to die whilst doing a good deed !: 69.64
<S> we must have felt what it is to die , morrel , that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living .: 40.86
<S> happy rogue , said caderousse ; you are going to find your servants , your horses , your carriage , and your betrothed ! yes , said andrea .: 23.89

<S> my dear fellow , said debray , you have come in the nick of time .: 17.18
<S> there came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs , flowers and leaves , which delighted the heart .: 117.39
<S> but how ?: 26.83
<S> nothing , sir ; it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind .: 43.30
<S> having wished you all to witness the challenge , he now wishes you to be present at the combat . exactly so , said the young men ; you have probably guessed right . but , after all these arrangements , he does not come himself , said cha teau renaud .: 45.91
<S> absence severs as well as death , and if the walls of a prison were between edmond and merce de s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone . 0056m yes ; but one gets out of prison , said caderousse , who , with what sense was left him , listened eagerly to the conversation , and when one gets out and one s name is edmond dante s , one seeks revenge what matters that ? muttered fernand .: 63.83
<S> it was , however , too late ; albert had followed the footman , and , hearing the order given , forced the door open , and followed by beauchamp found himself in the banker s study .: 30.67
<S> she took it , and looked attentively on the count ; there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration .: 47.10
<S> i would rather find it triply bolted . and , indeed , the little note and pin upon the table confirmed , or rather corroborated , the sad truth .: 74.08
<S> generally you are only rude , but tonight you are brutal . it is because i am in a worse humor than usual , replied danglars .: 42.63
<S> peppino , said the brigand chief , give me the torch . what are you going to do ? inquired the count .: 13.77
<S> so i have been told already , monseigneur , cried bonacieux , giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him , but i swear to you that i know nothing about it . the cardinal repressed a smile .: 42.50
<S> there the great number of inns puzzled them ; they could not go to all ; how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed ?: 91.25
<S> he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage ; then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it , he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris .: 53.86
<S> i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife s father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers .: 46.65
<S> well , monsieur le comte , said the duchess , smiling , does one leave so solemnly his old friends ? ah , murmured athos , kissing her hand , had i only sooner known that marie michon was so charming a creature ! and he withdrew , sighing .: 34.17
<S> i thought my body was my own , and that i might sell it .: 26.00
<S> the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators ; the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed ; the steps even seemed a parti colored sea , that was impelled towards the portico ; every niche in the wall held its living statue .: 112.18
<S> the next day came and passed , the day after , a week ; i then wrote to the cardinal .: 30.86
<S> there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below ; but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot , and also that someone , who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard , was approaching the spot where he sat .: 64.99
<S> in which the plot thickens chapter xii .: 54.98
<S> you start for paris ?: 48.79
<S> oh , ungrateful girl that i am , cried valentine , sobbing , i will give up all , even my dear old grandfather , whom i had nearly forgotten . no , said maximilian , you shall not leave him .: 32.47
<S> madame , said the president , you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at yanina , and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the event . i was , indeed , said the stranger , with a tone of sweet melancholy , and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the east .: 27.04
<S> edmond and merce de s were clasped in each other s arms .: 21.04
<S> i took a week to go , another to return , four days of quarantine , and forty eight hours to stay there ; that makes three weeks .: 73.00
<S> two men lay prone upon the ground , one bathed in blood and motionless , with his face toward the earth ; this one was dead .: 55.16
<S> do you wish to go to m. danglars ?: 11.47
<S> the porter got up as euge nie expected , and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out , but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his riding whip , he opened it immediately .: 44.85
<S> dante s continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot , until this man uvre was completed , and then he added , half mast the colors , and square the yards ! you see , said danglars , he fancies himself captain already , upon my word . and so , in fact , he is , said the owner .: 50.38
<S> oliva corsinari , was it not ? oliva corsinari ! a marchioness ? a marchioness ! and you married her at last , notwithstanding the opposition of her family ? yes , that was the way it ended . and you have doubtless brought all your papers with you ? said monte cristo .: 52.68
<S> has changarnier been killed ?: 84.82
<S> five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance .: 38.39
<S> i m no thief , but an honest citizen , well off in the world , with a house of my own .: 44.99
<S> chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously seeking .: 188.88
<S> his guards , taking him by the arms and coat collar , forced him to rise , and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress , while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind .: 76.01
<S> he has broken his ribs , said the commander , in a low voice .: 20.32
<S> he had doubtless seen all .: 37.80
<S> her preserver was everywhere sought for , but he did not appear ; he was inquired after , but no one had seen him .: 45.52
<S> you are among friends , said athos , in english ; so cheer up , and tell us , if you have the strength to do so , what has happened ? the king , muttered the wounded man , the king is a prisoner . you have seen him ? asked aramis , in the same language .: 22.90
<S> we bear witness to this , said the two musketeers , with one voice .: 30.04
<S> two musketeers were pacing the court , to whom d artagnan called by their names .: 33.96
<S> come , fernand , won t you return to marseilles with us ? no , said fernand ; i shall return to the catalans . you re wrong .: 29.09
<S> you believe so ? i dare not positively assert it , as he has been lost for so long a time . well , then , said monte cristo you have all the documents with you ? your excellency , i regret to say that , not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers , i neglected to bring them . that is unfortunate , returned monte cristo .: 28.91
<S> felton , then , had spoken in her favor , since lord de winter had not been willing to listen to him .: 21.78
<S> like the ancient paladins , he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love .: 110.35
<S> for an instant he feared lest , instead of keeping in shore , she should stand out to sea ; but he soon saw that she would pass , like most vessels bound for italy , between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne .: 82.62
<S> when he thought the matter over , he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson french towards him ; and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this : we had better help a man who owes us nearly 300,000 francs , and have those 300,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin , and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again . unfortunately , whether through envy or stupidity , all morrel s correspondents did not take this view ; and some even came to a contrary decision .: 108.76
<S> i give you the rest of tonight and all day tomorrow .: 36.36
<S> the devil ! exclaimed the gascon , tis a dreadful night , my lord .: 17.90
<S> your excellency , said peppino , addressing the count , if you will follow me , the opening of the catacombs is close at hand . go on , then , replied the count .: 19.71
<S> then , as i believed my husband would be at home , i hastened hither . to place yourself under his protection ? oh , no , poor dear man !: 53.60
<S> the air i breathe is the air of liberty !: 65.75
<S> aramis went to cromwell s desk , tore off three bits of paper of equal size , wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions , and presented them open to mordaunt , who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to aramis .: 68.71
<S> on the eighth day after the scene we have described , the cardinal received a letter with the london stamp which only contained these lines : i have them ; but i am unable to leave london for want of money .: 49.02
<S> it is for a consultation , which will last three hours at least .: 34.47
<S> two or three times a week .: 22.74
<S> on the landing d artagnan blushed ; in the antechamber he trembled .: 36.04
<S> do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man ? i hope you have a sword at home ; but at all events , i have two , and if you like , i will throw with you for one of them . needless , said the englishman ; i am well furnished with such playthings . very well , my worthy gentleman , replied d artagnan , pick out the longest , and come and show it to me this evening . where , if you please ? behind the luxembourg ; that s a charming spot for such amusements as the one i propose to you . that will do ; i will be there . your hour ? six o clock . a propos , you have probably one or two friends ? i have three , who would be honored by joining in the sport with me . three ?: 38.45
<S> my father s melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects , which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding , and i am perfectly convinced that at the present time , although , he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married , m. noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson . m. de villefort had scarcely said this , when the door opened , and barrois appeared .: 39.05
<S> vanitas vanitatum ! according to your idea , then , my brain is turned .: 82.06

<S> if you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation .: 21.77
<S> danglars looked radiant with joy ; the banker accompanied him to the door .: 26.13
<S> can this be another vengeance of that woman ? it was now athos who turned pale .: 61.93
<S> the count was , it may be remembered , a most temperate guest .: 45.70
<S> when the young guardsman and the three musketeers were without witnesses , they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation .: 27.13
<S> d artagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment .: 14.95
<S> to reach england athos lowered his voice all france , covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal , must be crossed .: 141.98
<S> he did seek , and has found him , apparently , since he is here now ; and , finally , my friend apprised me of your coming , and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune .: 56.90
<S> ghosts chapter 63 .: 121.66
<S> however , continued monte cristo , drawing a small phial from his pocket , i have an infallible remedy . so saying , he bowed to the baroness and her daughter , exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count , and left madame danglars box .: 29.64
<S> i once possessed piety , innocence , and love , the three ingredients of the happiness of angels , and now what am i ? monte cristo approached her , and silently took her hand .: 43.33
<S> this evening your destiny begins to change . amen ! exclaimed d artagnan , stopping the carriage .: 54.47
<S> as to d artagnan , who as yet knew nobody in the capital , he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province , and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the guards .: 41.44
<S> posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character , which history explains only by facts and never by reason .: 184.40
<S> on tuesday , the theatres open at ten o clock in the morning , as lent begins after eight at night .: 59.52
<S> this was the more easy for our three companions in particular ; for being friends of m. de tre ville , they obtained from him special permission to be absent after the closing of the camp .: 42.98
<S> sit down , dear count , and go on with your story . at this point i have to accuse myself of a fault , madame .: 39.87
<S> planchet , who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade , declared that he would follow d artagnan even to the end of the world , either by the road to the right or by that to the left ; only he begged his former master to set out in the evening , for greater security to himself .: 42.71
<S> kill myself ? he cried , throwing down his knife ; why should i do so ? why , you said , answered mademoiselle danglars , that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals . 50055m bah , said cavalcanti , crossing his arms , one has friends . the brigadier advanced to him , sword in hand .: 51.70
<S> ah , very well , replied the cardinal , quickly .: 11.57
<S> sang diou !: 498.89
<S> these details will guide her on her part , and on your return , i shall perhaps have some good news to tell you .: 41.49
<S> as he was finishing , the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard .: 27.73
<S> the young man was opening the door of the stable .: 15.33
<S> love me then , hayde e !: 44.22
<S> it is you who are not a woman , muttered mazarin .: 20.13
<S> well !: 14.47
<S> pardon !: 43.46
<S> how exquisitely coselli sings his part . but what an awkward , inelegant fellow he is . well , then , what do you say to la specchia ?: 53.27
<S> at length tuesday came , the last and most tumultuous day of the carnival .: 64.52
<S> 17 the genoese conspirator .: 309.33
<S> a rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does ; a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith .: 58.70
<S> good , answered grimaud ; and he went right to the prisoner .: 38.30
<S> what do you think of that interrogator ? asked aramis .: 9.20
<S> at a quarter to six o clock , monsieur de gondy , having finished his business , returned to the archiepiscopal palace .: 21.05
<S> i won t hold my tongue ! replied caderousse ; i say i want to know why they should put dante s in prison ; i like dante s ; dante s , your health ! and he swallowed another glass of wine .: 35.14
<S> i know what is become of vasiliki and hayde e .: 35.20
<S> you were in a cloister , said the executioner , and you left it to ruin my brother . milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees .: 22.67
<S> thus the dealer to whom d artagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the originality of his color .: 56.84
<S> in that case , in the name of heaven , continued he , throwing him a pistole , tell me what you have seen , and i will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my heart . the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen , and repeated in a low voice : it was scarcely nine o clock when i heard a noise in the street , and was wondering what it could be , when on coming to my door , i found that somebody was endeavoring to open it .: 28.10
<S> in the name of heaven , cried dante s , speak again , though the sound of your voice terrifies me .: 19.09
<S> i have not that honor , monseigneur , replied the latter , his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which d artagnan traveled .: 33.78
<S> does the letter contain anything valuable ? demanded the host , after a few minutes of useless investigation .: 54.18
<S> madame , said villefort , i ask where is m. d avrigny ?: 16.69
<S> madame de villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall , and there , shaded by the bed curtains , she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of valentine .: 43.63
<S> she was seated .: 27.24
<S> i opened my eyes , astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt ; a third of the squadron were lying on the ground , wounded , dead or dying .: 69.29
<S> because tomorrow , hayde e , you will be free ; you will then assume your proper position in society , for i will not allow my destiny to overshadow yours .: 54.73
<S> nevertheless , day dawned without darkness having brought any accident .: 147.98
<S> but what is going on in this accursed paris ? what is going on , my lord ?: 26.21
<S> it is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little madame bonacieux . that s true .: 42.15
<S> none . for a moment dante s was speechless ; then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident , or even stopped up , for the sake of greater security , by cardinal spada .: 48.86
<S> then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal .: 31.24
<S> i recognize him . it is the monk , whispered porthos to aramis .: 33.06

<S> the king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the palais royal .: 38.83
<S> he turned and saw a young woman , who made him a sign to follow her .: 12.44
<S> the first named malefactor will be mazzolato , the second culprit decapitato .: 65.94
<S> thank you ! cried he , throwing himself on his horse .: 12.57
<S> the keeper would leave me in the background , and take all the glory to himself .: 44.81
<S> eh ?: 58.00
<S> your eminence , said the august visitor , it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen , my sister , but i have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men . madame , said mazarin , your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction . he is very gracious , thought the queen ; can he have guessed my errand ? give , continued the cardinal , your commands to the most respectful of your servants . alas , sir , replied the queen , i have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions .: 43.11
<S> revolving all this in her mind , she cast her eyes around her , and arranged the topography of the garden in her head .: 35.20
<S> your mother your sister !: 57.74
<S> edward begged for a long while , the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it ; however at length he decided , leaped out of the window into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies , and ran to his mother , his forehead streaming with perspiration .: 104.07
<S> a moment later , madame de villefort entered the drawing room with her little edward .: 20.85
<S> bonacieux , with some embarrassment , the cause of this event ? he attributed it , i believe , to a political cause . i doubted from the first ; and now i think entirely as he does .: 60.45
<S> as for myself , i neither have , nor desire to have , a mistress , following in that respect the very judicious example of athos , who has none any more than i have . but what the devil !: 68.25
<S> listen .: 40.91
<S> perhaps , said athos ; but at all events listen well to this .: 52.38
<S> the three musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make a step forward .: 26.90
<S> he said , as to your friend , tell him he may sleep in peace . good , very good , said porthos ; that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a baron . at this moment nine o clock struck .: 39.06
<S> if you had seen at what a pace he came like the wind ! i should think so , a horse that cost 5,000 francs ! said monte cristo , in the tone which a father would use towards a son .: 70.85
<S> at sight of him madame de villefort uttered an expression of pleasure , and , holding the child still closer towards her , she said : edward , dearest , do you see that good man ?: 32.97
<S> you are born to good fortune , said franz , as he returned the letter .: 35.41
<S> twelve hours delay was all that was granted that is , until nine the next morning .: 112.94
<S> i speak to you when i can catch you .: 23.89
<S> you conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him , and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him . yes , yes ! cried both young men .: 31.72
<S> he traversed the island , after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left , and re embarked for marciana .: 53.63
<S> if grimaud was slow in speaking , we know that he was quick to act ; he sprang to the door and shook it violently , but it was bolted on the other side .: 40.42
<S> men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder , their walk on the boulevard de gand , and the cafe de paris . it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street , appeared every day on the fashionable walk , and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine , that is , if you are on good terms with its waiters .: 72.75
<S> there , said the king , looking at a clock , there , now , as it is half past eight , you may retire ; for as i told you , i expect someone at nine .: 30.68
<S> madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added : we thought this news would possess an interest for you , sir , who have always entertained a great affection for valentine ; it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined .: 48.63
<S> she lived in a small town with her brother , who was a curate .: 37.08
<S> is it not amusing to see them both on the same table ? what are the two fish ? asked danglars .: 32.67
<S> how could i help being astonished when , without having the least expectation of such a thing , i meet you face to face you , of whom we have so often spoken together , you whom he loves with all his soul , you whom he had taught me to love before i had seen you !: 77.61
<S> come , porthos , join me ; say frankly , what do you think of this business ? nothing good , replied porthos .: 19.34
<S> by the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of erquinheim .: 43.32
<S> but then , young man and i pray of you to give me your full attention , then i thought i could not be doing anything displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty one who had committed no offence , and merited not condemnation . and have your notions changed ? asked dante s with much surprise ; do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me ? no ; neither do i wish to incur guilt .: 81.41
<S> maximilian ! said valentine , maximilian , come back , i entreat you ! he drew near with his sweet smile , and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood .: 35.87
<S> a key was inserted in the lock of the first door , and the creaking of hinges was audible .: 26.78
<S> yes , my friend ; and now now , what ? asked porthos .: 14.58
<S> the most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind .: 38.24
<S> the master was to get all this out of leghorn free of duties , and land it on the shores of corsica , where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to france .: 91.95
<S> d artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the rue d assas is now situated , breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the rue de vaugirard , and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night .: 50.91
<S> i neither ill use nor ill treat my servants by word or action .: 296.18
<S> it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met ; besides , it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn , and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready .: 77.54
<S> i thought that we were finally quit of monsieur de beaufort . yes , you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water .: 93.05
<S> ha , ha ! cried lord de winter ; ha , ha !: 14.05
<S> i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day , said beauchamp ; but he is perfectly unknown to me . have you mentioned this death in your paper ? it has been mentioned , but the article is not mine ; indeed , i doubt if it will please m. villefort , for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king s attorney , he would have interested himself somewhat more about it . still , said cha teau renaud , dr .: 43.87
<S> besides , he said , a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about . on the contrary , it is a matter of the utmost importance , edmond ! replied the old man .: 27.26
<S> louis xviii .: 14.91
<S> she had been engaged in arranging the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered ; she could not get out and had heard all .: 50.02
<S> tis he ! murmured winter , his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his side .: 48.18
<S> have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today ? a fine pleasure , indeed , monsieur !: 50.63
<S> want one ! cried the gascon .: 28.04
<S> what is his name ? count albert ; it is the same man whom i rescued from the hands of the banditti at rome . in what language would you like me to converse with him ? monte cristo turned to albert .: 25.28
<S> porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished .: 60.74
<S> it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built , so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt ; but the well oiled hinges and locks told quite another story .: 111.89
<S> danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner , put in your head ! but this was not the time for recrimination , so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile : excuse me , sir , but are they not going to give me any dinner ? does your excellency happen to be hungry ? happen to be hungry , that s pretty good , when i haven t eaten for twenty four hours ! muttered danglars .: 53.32
<S> stop a moment , cried d artagnan ; pray how many men have you on board , captain ? i don t understand , was the reply .: 25.22
<S> then , my dear sir ; i am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and will be delighted to kill you also .: 53.21
<S> ah , said morrel , falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despair ah , you are playing with me , like those good , or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words , because their screams annoy them .: 80.27
<S> now you are exactly what i dreamt you were , the man i always loved .: 51.86
<S> conclusion .: 151.45
<S> what ! cried d artagnan , is your first witness monsieur porthos ? yes , that disturbs you ? by no means . and here is the second . d artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos , and perceived aramis .: 30.08
<S> well ? i would reform her ; it would be rendering a service to her future son in law . how would you set about it ? ah , that would be easy enough i would give her a lesson . a lesson ? yes .: 48.99
<S> madame de villefort , who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately , retired to her bedroom , while the procureur , who could better depend upon himself , proceeded at once to the salon .: 51.61
<S> he answered in the same language .: 19.54
<S> the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there , and the sheets , to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung , were dragged across the room .: 59.30
<S> d artagnan ran out and returned directly after .: 33.32
<S> i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance , and other wretches , like morcerf , danglars , villefort , even morcerf himself , must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy .: 92.58
<S> move , monsieur move away , i entreat you ; you are exactly in the spot ! what spot ? where he fell . 20281m my dear monsieur bertuccio , said monte cristo , laughing , control yourself ; we are not at sarte ne or at corte .: 67.62
<S> ah , those orientals ; they are the only men who know how to live .: 36.97
<S> we shall be very unfortunate if , after meeting so often this evening , we should not succeed in meeting to morrow . oh , as to that , sir , replied chatillon for it was he who , with flamarens , was leaving the duc de beaufort , you may be assured ; for if we meet by night without seeking each other , much more shall we meet by day when wishing it . i hope that is true , said aramis .: 45.26
<S> when this speech was arranged , villefort turned to dante s .: 33.49
<S> and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you ? he did . and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter ? yes . and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier ? yes . why , you poor short sighted simpleton , can you not guess who this noirtier was , whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed ?: 128.09
<S> depraved as a girl , adulterous as a wife , an unnatural sister , homicide , poisoner , execrated by all who knew her , by every nation that had been visited by her , she died accursed by heaven and earth . a sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood ; he clenched his fists , sweat covered his face , his hair , like hamlet s , stood on end , and racked with fury he cried out : silence , sir !: 74.00
<S> and why have you such an air of sadness aboard ? a great misfortune , m. morrel , replied the young man , a great misfortune , for me especially !: 30.05
<S> you accuse me of fear ; i have not so much as you have , since i do not fly as you do .: 23.66
<S> she went to the palais , replied the steward .: 18.28
<S> but since then everything has changed in and about me ; i am accustomed to brave difficulties , and , in the conflict to crush those who , by their own free will , or by chance , voluntarily or involuntarily , interfere with me in my career .: 88.87
<S> i know this , because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his .: 51.12
<S> when he arrives , i will not fail to do so . just then , a handsome young man , with bright eyes , black hair , and glossy moustache , respectfully bowed to madame de villefort .: 29.53
<S> each of them took one , which ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee .: 77.09
<S> and remember my life depends on your answer .: 63.60
<S> it is of no use for you to know anything about it , said the young woman , whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw back .: 36.02
<S> mademoiselle was walking in the shade of the garden , and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock . and i caught it , mamma , don t you remember ? interposed edward , and i pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail . you , madame , remained under the arbor ; do you not remember , that while you were seated on a stone bench , and while , as i told you , mademoiselle de villefort and your young son were absent , you conversed for a considerable time with somebody ? yes , in truth , yes , answered the young lady , turning very red , i do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle ; he was a medical man , i think . precisely so , madame ; this man was myself ; for a fortnight i had been at that hotel , during which period i had cured my valet de chambre of a fever , and my landlord of the jaundice , so that i really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician .: 52.06
<S> besides , i am a picard . then it is understood , said d artagnan ; you would rather be killed than desert your post ? yes , monsieur ; and there is nothing i would not do to prove to monsieur that i am attached to him . good ! said d artagnan to himself .: 24.10
<S> fly , then ! cried mademoiselle d armilly , whose pity returned as her fears diminished ; fly ! or kill yourself ! said euge nie in a tone which a vestal in the amphitheatre would have used , when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary .: 103.29
<S> milady was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh , and she was sufficiently skillful to prevail over all the obstacles of the mind .: 42.18
<S> yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall , as impenetrable as futurity , without strict scrutiny ; he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it , or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way .: 67.29
<S> well a day !: 62.92
<S> i wish i were on board already , and he looked back again .: 53.02
<S> for you , he said .: 12.22
<S> contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below .: 29.49
<S> does he hate his majesty as much as he does us ? pardi , answered athos we only carried off his mother ; the king has spoiled him of his name and property . true , said aramis ; but silence !: 66.01
<S> penelon , penelon ! an old man , who was digging busily at one of the beds , stuck his spade in the earth , and approached , cap in hand , striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek .: 59.76
<S> franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle .: 41.45
<S> finally , said felton , finally , what did they do ? at length , one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not conquer .: 76.11
<S> you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated . i shall no sooner be out of prison than i shall be master of paris . pshaw !: 47.99
<S> suppose i were a soldier like you , and ordered to carry a certain redoubt , and you knew i must be killed in the assault , would you not say to me , as you said just now , go , father ; for you are dishonored by delay , and death is preferable to shame ! yes , yes , said the young man , yes ; and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure , he said , be it so , my father . and he rushed out of the study .: 40.01
<S> if he should have known me again ! how ?: 38.97
<S> in god s name answer me ! he is with edward , who is not quite well , replied madame de villefort , no longer being able to avoid answering .: 36.13
<S> shall you never leave me again ?: 29.53
<S> the procureur , who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m. noirtier and the elder d e pinay , well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced ; but , feigning not to perceive either , he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife .: 62.75
<S> at the end of two hours , as porthos did not come , not any news of him , they resumed their journey .: 19.77
<S> carmela looked all around her , but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own , or those of her companions .: 53.37
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> my friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces , and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running noose .: 54.08
<S> there are many stories related of him , and among them this .: 90.14
<S> he , having seen them crossing the yard , took care not to answer , and they rang in vain .: 43.13
<S> lieutenant felton , from lord de winter , said patrick .: 55.42
<S> he brings an irreproachable name , which maximilian is likely to render glorious , since at thirty years of age he is a captain , an officer of the legion of honor . the old man signified that he recollected him .: 42.63
<S> adieu , perhaps farewell . at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived ; he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw .: 65.42
<S> how fortunate that euge nie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble ! and her glance was turned towards heaven , where a mysterious providence disposes all things , and out of a fault , nay , even a vice , sometimes produces a blessing .: 78.99
<S> all fell to their knees .: 55.45
<S> it was an order the count had just given , for immediately ali went noiselessly , and returned , bearing a black dress and a three cornered hat .: 69.28
<S> but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first , and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor .: 49.99
<S> ho !: 16.63
<S> d artagnan , however , who had consulted with aramis , spoke to the poor wretch .: 25.52
<S> as for athos , they believed him to be dead , and left him very quiet on the field of battle , not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away .: 36.41
<S> what say you to that , monsieur du vallon ? he added in a low tone to porthos .: 16.53
<S> at the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade .: 14.19
<S> caderousse became thoughtful .: 54.93
<S> this was the last blow to the prisoner .: 23.86
<S> he was , then , as punctual as the samaritan woman , and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say .: 53.32
<S> athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger ; but arriving at four crossroads , he stopped again , visibly embarrassed .: 73.58
<S> the young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by m. chapelain .: 55.03
<S> are you satisfied , gentlemen ? asked mazarin .: 8.40
<S> no one answered .: 17.49
<S> after breakfast , it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at athos s lodging , and there finish their plans .: 39.67
<S> is he some minister out of office ? oh , no , not at all , vicomte , athos replied ; he is simply a gentleman of great genius who has fallen into disgrace with the cardinal through having written certain verses against him . do gentlemen , then , make verses ? asked raoul , naively , i thought it was derogatory . so it is , my dear vicomte , said athos , laughing , to make bad ones ; but to make good ones increases fame witness monsieur de rotrou .: 63.80
<S> hayde e s learned reference is to the behavior of an actor in the dionysian festivals . ed .: 97.29
<S> no , certainly not , and from this moment i will endeavor to model myself after him .: 29.60
<S> but be of good cheer ; with certain people , everything comes round . oh , you render me the happiest of men !: 75.60
<S> you wish to leave before everybody and at what hour ? at ten o clock . and the queen , at what time is it her wish to start ? at midnight . then it is possible .: 34.83
<S> it is certainly the king , said the man , rising again .: 18.73
<S> where am i ? he asked himself .: 14.72
<S> the major seated himself , therefore , by the side of danglars , who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man , and yet who , being able to allow his son 60,000 francs a year , might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500,000 or 600,000 livres .: 40.92
<S> noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness , while barrois , who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed , smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead .: 45.06
<S> signed , beaurepaire , duchampy , and lecharpal . when franz had finished reading this account , so dreadful for a son ; when valentine , pale with emotion , had wiped away a tear ; when villefort , trembling , and crouched in a corner , had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man , sir , said d e pinay to noirtier , since you are well acquainted with all these details , which are attested by honorable signatures , since you appear to take some interest in me , although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow , refuse me not one final satisfaction tell me the name of the president of the club , that i may at least know who killed my father . villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door ; valentine , who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather s answer , and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm , drew back a few steps .: 69.05
<S> mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as , in later times , frederick of prussia used to be .: 218.67
<S> it is deeply engraved on my heart , and , after what you have just said , i remember that only . cha teau renaud and beauchamp looked at each other ; the impression was the same on both of them , and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued .: 54.39
<S> madame , resumed athos , two of my friends , named d artagnan and monsieur du vallon , sent to england by the cardinal , suddenly disappeared when they set foot on the shores of france ; no one knows what has become of them . well ? said the queen .: 20.70
<S> but my lord , tell me , she continued , hide nothing from me what is , in truth , the king s position ?: 37.52
<S> well , merce de s , beloved by you , i would tempt fortune ; you would bring me good luck , and i should become rich .: 39.07
<S> i have now the boldness to ask you for an interview of half an hour . i grant it , monsieur , replied madame de chevreuse with her most gracious smile .: 20.98
<S> you see i am a good sort of a man . do not jest about holy things , my friend . go on , then , i listen . i had been at the seminary from nine years old ; in three days i should have been twenty .: 31.85
<S> on the days when he won he was insolent and ostentatious ; if he lost , he disappeared completely for several days , after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person , but with money in his purse .: 90.46
<S> well , now , that would be a real fortune to us , my friend ; let us go back to the jew s again . what !: 23.24
<S> he rode up a very quiet street , looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful englishwoman , when from the ground floor of a pretty house , which , according to the fashion of the time , had no window toward the street , he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted .: 48.79
<S> the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement ; his presence , therefore , was wholly unnoticed , save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself .: 44.68
<S> mazarin turned again to his papers .: 43.17
<S> this enemy was milady .: 53.19
<S> i believe not .: 27.49
<S> the diamond which glittered in the window at marle s or fossin s shines with more splendor when it is our own ; but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another , and still must retain the one that is inferior , do you not know what we have to endure ? worldling , murmured the count .: 72.20
<S> a few steps in advance of the gate of saint honore they met a third troop ; this latter party was composed of ill looking fellows , who resembled bandits more than anything else ; they were the men of the beggar of saint eustache .: 64.69
<S> 7 dr. guillotin got the idea of his famous machine from witnessing an execution in italy .: 246.54
<S> i had but to write to the duchesse but i won t repeat her name , for i am incapable of compromising a woman ; but this i know , that i had but to write to her and she would have sent me fifteen hundred . the procurator s wife shed a tear .: 49.17
<S> cries of live the king !: 88.46
<S> was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there ?: 68.26
<S> as little sensitive as was the heart of d artagnan , he was touched by this mute sorrow ; but he held too tenaciously to his projects , above all to this one , to change the program which he had laid out in advance .: 63.92
<S> he is reduced almost to the last extremity nay , he is almost at the point of dishonor . how ? yes , continued caderousse , so it is ; after five and twenty years of labor , after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of marseilles , m. morrel is utterly ruined ; he has lost five ships in two years , has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses , and his only hope now is in that very pharaon which poor dante s commanded , and which is expected from the indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo .: 55.93
<S> why , much the same story . but how could a poor catalan fisher boy , without education or resources , make a fortune ?: 116.64
<S> they proceeded thus to peronne .: 49.05
<S> the prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw them taken .: 53.34
<S> pay and eat . and what am i to pay with , brute ? said danglars , enraged .: 68.19
<S> the musketeers , few in number , not being able , in the midst of this crowd , to make their horses wheel around , began to give way .: 54.42
<S> sire , said athos , we foresaw this ; and if lord winter s men but do their duty , we are saved , instead of lost . at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses winter s voice crying out : sword in hand ! at these words every sword was drawn , and glittered in the air like lightning .: 67.99
<S> i was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongs an officer , brave and handsome as a youthful caesar ; then , pretending to see raoul for the first time : ah !: 63.54
<S> at the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him , but had consulted young maximilian s taste .: 59.85
<S> signor pastrini came to the door to receive his guests .: 23.09
<S> in case of any attempt to escape , the penalty of death is to be applied .: 37.61
<S> he was des roches le masle , canon of notre dame , who had formerly been valet of a bishop , who introduced him to his eminence as a perfectly devout man .: 67.20
<S> the unknown spurred his horse to a gallop .: 48.50
<S> what hinders it ? exclaimed the king .: 18.78
<S> there it is , cried the jesuit ; the world still speaks within you in a loud voice , altisima voce .: 84.00
<S> when i return , which will be in about an hour , you must offer him to me as a servant , and upon your recommendation , though he doesn t speak a word of french , i take him into my service .: 35.71
<S> caderousse drew a deep breath .: 49.58
<S> there are moments when a man grows young again in his children . the duchess smiled , half tenderly , half ironically .: 87.57
<S> come , said he to the abbe , i am anxious to see your treasures . the abbe smiled , and , proceeding to the disused fireplace , raised , by the help of his chisel , a long stone , which had doubtless been the hearth , beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth , serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to dante s .: 42.17
<S> what convent ?: 54.97
<S> the horse was of hungarian breed , and ambled along at an easy pace .: 51.58
<S> the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage ; and this operation ended , he took his place beside milady , and shut the door .: 33.14
<S> neither of them there ! she again said , as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her .: 52.45
<S> and with how many fingers does he bless ?: 94.90
<S> i will describe my captivity .: 34.10
<S> the man carried me to the foundling asylum , where i was registered under the number 37 .: 71.58
<S> an adventure on the high road .: 41.50
<S> alas , sir , exclaimed barrois , a great misfortune has happened .: 22.53
<S> you are the son of my aunt , consequently my cousin ; you come from noyon , in picardy ; you have several lawsuits and no attorney .: 71.55
<S> de guiche might have been about eighteen years of age , but he was scarcely taller than raoul , who was only fifteen .: 29.84
<S> as i have said , she was twice married , once in france , the second time in england . she was young , you say ? twenty five years old . beautiful ? ravishingly . blond ? yes . abundance of hair falling over her shoulders ? yes . eyes of an admirable expression ? when she chose .: 69.96
<S> it was a kind of covered wagon , painted black , and was one of the first to arrive .: 47.21
<S> an unhappy prisoner , replied dante s , who made no hesitation in answering .: 39.42
<S> here , said she , you see i have thought of everything ; with this cloak you will not be cold . but you ? oh , i am never cold , you know !: 29.75
<S> as to their majesties , they did not return to the louvre till six o clock in the morning .: 13.55
<S> but do you know where ? no . in the king s room . the king s room ? cried athos .: 16.19
<S> i bought some spanish shares .: 55.09
<S> i could not ride behind .: 41.14
<S> isn t it reasonable ? yes , dear friend , athos replied , but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonable it was noble and generous .: 46.65
<S> cromwell is mighty , mazarin is tricky , but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt . ah ! said porthos , it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt . my faith , yes , said d artagnan .: 31.45
<S> but tell me , count , will your people take care of my horse ? do not alarm yourself , my dear maximilian they understand . i mean , because he wants petting .: 46.24
<S> this is where the mad abbe was kept , sir , and that is where the young man entered ; and the guide pointed to the opening , which had remained unclosed .: 45.84
<S> at the same moment , whilst d artagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen , a metallic sound , as if some one was moving a bag of gold , struck on his ear ; he started ; instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase .: 47.68
<S> what are you going to do , my friend ? asked morrel , arresting his hand .: 10.62
<S> milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart .: 106.15
<S> the picture seems to have a malign influence , for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it , and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping .: 104.36
<S> in an adjoining room andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two , two bottles of wine sealed , the one with green , the other with yellow , a supply of brandy in a decanter , and a measure of fruit in a cabbage leaf , cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate .: 94.99
<S> as they left paris , an equipage with four horses , at full speed , was seen to draw up suddenly ; it contained monte cristo .: 57.07
<S> from that moment he grew very guarded .: 54.50
<S> the friendship which united these four men , and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day , whether for dueling , business , or pleasure , caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows ; and the inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another , from the luxembourg to the place st. sulpice , or from the rue du vieux colombier to the luxembourg .: 51.51
<S> i am free , replied maximilian , and rich enough to support you .: 26.22
<S> he was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner , close to la ramee s heart , that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his determination .: 31.42
<S> from the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow .: 47.52
<S> there he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed , and stopped for the third time .: 36.15
<S> is it my equipment ? yes and no , replied mousqueton .: 30.58
<S> soon the two gentlemen stopped also .: 68.77
<S> your holiness , said the curate , here is the person of whom i had the honor to speak to you . planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses .: 26.70
<S> teresa alone ruled by a look , a word , a gesture , this impetuous character , which yielded beneath the hand of a woman , and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken , but could never have been bended .: 48.33
<S> well ? cried porthos .: 13.16
<S> the reference is no doubt to the wistaria frutescens . ed .: 95.01
<S> albert glanced carelessly at the different missives , selected two written in a small and delicate hand , and enclosed in scented envelopes , opened them and perused their contents with some attention .: 102.73
<S> when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall , letting his legs dangle outside .: 74.08
<S> him i can place at your disposal ; it is count de rochefort . i know him also , but unfortunately he is not in paris . my lord , he has been for three days at the rue cassette . and wherefore has he not been to see me ? he was told my lord will pardon me certainly , speak . that your lordship was about to treat with the court . gondy bit his lips .: 40.15
<S> has he built one here , then ? no , but he has a very comfortable one all the same , so they say . you know this chief , then ? i have heard talk of him . favorably or otherwise ? both . the deuce ! and what is this condition ? that you are blindfolded , and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you . franz looked at gaetano , to see , if possible , what he thought of this proposal .: 66.17
<S> a million in gold remains ; it is buried in the cellars of newcastle keep .: 131.62
<S> well , i shall write to the abbe ; i shall hold him responsible for his prote ge s misconduct , and i shall soon know all about this assassination .: 38.27
<S> he took the money which athos offered to him , and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands , suddenly cried out that it was bad , and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers .: 46.01
<S> turned around , astonished that any one should dare to address him .: 85.10
<S> yes , it is very annoying , said vampa ; but we have not seen him . then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions , but in vain ; then , after a time , they disappeared .: 29.75
<S> we lived together , we loved , we hated together ; we shed , we mingled our blood together , and too probably , i may still add , that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship ; perhaps there may be the bond of crime ; for we four , we once did condemn , judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world , although apparently fitter for hell than for this life .: 126.86
<S> a customs officer was laid low , and two sailors wounded ; dante s was one of the latter , a ball having touched him in the left shoulder .: 50.35
<S> these steps drew near to his dungeon , the door was thrown open , and the guards appeared .: 22.25
<S> or rather you insult me , continued she , pressing with her stiffened hands the two arms of her easy chair , and raising herself upon her wrists .: 48.89
<S> the peasant , the gardener , was rochefort , whom he believed to be in the bastile .: 30.65
<S> they had found the door of the grotto opened , and gone forth ; on the azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars .: 57.01
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> you believed that you would fly from me by returning to paris ; you believed that i would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to watch .: 48.73
<S> halloo ! cried d artagnan ; has something fresh happened ? eh , sir ! replied the sergeant , their vehicle has broken down a second time ; it really must be doomed . they are bad managers , said d artagnan , shrugging his shoulders .: 32.97
<S> the little house was surrounded by a low , quickset hedge , two or three feet high .: 44.99
<S> scendi ! exclaimed a commanding voice .: 42.17
<S> at this spot milady had come out of the wood , and entered the carriage .: 15.79
<S> on the other hand , the symptoms may be much more violent , and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions , foam at the mouth , and cry out loudly .: 69.24
<S> if we can not , we will do without him .: 27.64
<S> all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck .: 60.53
<S> swear to be mute . i never swear , my lord , i say yes or no ; and , as i am a gentleman , i keep my word . come , then , i see that i must trust unreservedly to you . believe me , my lord , it will be your best plan . come , said mazarin , conducting d artagnan into the queen s oratory and desiring him to wait there .: 26.36
<S> he found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch patrol .: 114.96
<S> she slept as a prisoner sleeps , rocked by his first hope .: 95.93
<S> the four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment .: 27.29
<S> up , sire !: 74.52
<S> planchet , much surprised at the inquiry , turned back .: 55.83
<S> it happens well that we are going there this evening , said athos to the vicomte ; we will pay our compliments to that poor man . what , then , is this monsieur scarron , who thus puts all paris in commotion ?: 46.49
<S> the poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body .: 58.26
<S> he were a dead man said the gascon , if there were still a vitry at the court and if vitry entered at this moment ; but for my part , before he could reach the good prelate i would kill vitry at once ; the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me . hush ! said porthos ; listen . madame , cried the cardinal , seizing hold of anne and drawing her back , madame , what are you about ? then he added in spanish , anne , are you mad ?: 58.56
<S> it wants ten minutes to nine , said he .: 31.05
<S> never fear , said aramis .: 22.49
<S> he went to the coadjutor to consult with him whether it would not be better to send word to the duke to stop on the road , but gondy reflected for a moment , and then said : let him continue his journey . all is not then over ? asked rochefort .: 33.93
<S> buckingham remained nearly a year absent .: 160.95
<S> mademoiselle de villefort no longer requires help , said d avrigny , since she is dead . dead , dead ! groaned forth villefort , in a paroxysm of grief , which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man .: 46.43
<S> m. morrel , at his death , left 500,000 francs , which were divided between my sister and myself , for we were his only children .: 38.91
<S> charles s heart melted within him at the sight of those two children , whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of death .: 30.61
<S> yes , yes , mazarin continued , whilst his wonted smile , full of subtlety , lent a strange expression to his pale lips ; yes , these noises prove to me , indeed , that the destiny of favorites is precarious ; but ye shall know i am no ordinary favorite .: 69.52
<S> his eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study , and made a sign to rochefort to bring in the young musketeer .: 29.50
<S> yes , admirable !: 27.71
<S> go , sir , then , said the queen ; you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know . scarcely , however , had the tapestry closed behind athos when she said to mazarin : cardinal , desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court . your majesty , answered mazarin , desires me to do only what i was going to ask you to let me do .: 55.90
<S> not at all , prince , said monte cristo laying a marked stress on the title , what have i done for you ?: 40.86
<S> a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation , while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity .: 64.89
<S> e tienne , said he , see why mademoiselle euge nie has asked me to meet her in the drawing room , and why she makes me wait so long . having given this vent to his ill humor , the baron became more calm ; mademoiselle danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father , and had fixed on the gilded drawing room as the spot .: 57.07
<S> though answered in the negative , he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor , that , in despite of the oft repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied , dante s succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants , and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them .: 69.28
<S> the latter , leaving the shore , abandoned themselves gaily to the current .: 48.98
<S> they have been speaking of my marriage , have they not ? yes , replied the angry look .: 31.25
<S> what !: 14.83
<S> on his part aramis wrote a long letter .: 62.38
<S> bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness ; but let us hasten to say that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the happiness he had missed , than from the fear he entertained that some serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman .: 49.83
<S> as next to the queen , she was the most considerable personage of the fe te , she was received by the city officials , and placed in a box opposite to that which the queen was to occupy .: 40.80
<S> ah , yes ! said mousqueton .: 8.69
<S> aramis returned , laughing , one hat on his head and the other in his hand ; and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent .: 36.65
<S> i gave one to the sultan , who mounted it in his sabre ; another to our holy father the pope , who had it set in his tiara , opposite to one nearly as large , though not so fine , given by the emperor napoleon to his predecessor , pius vii .: 99.81
<S> are you sure you are more reasonable ? yes , said valentine ; and i have but one scruple , that of leaving my dear grandmother s remains , which i had undertaken to watch . valentine , said morrel , death is in itself sacred . yes , said valentine ; besides , it will not be for long . she then crossed the corridor , and led the way down a narrow staircase to m. noirtier s room ; morrel followed her on tiptoe ; at the door they found the old servant .: 35.64
<S> friend , cried planchet .: 38.62
<S> i see how it will be , said athos : we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other , and we have no need of one just now .: 39.61
<S> thus , it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover s arm .: 46.20
<S> i prize it it was given to my ancestor by king francis i .: 92.37
<S> that is the hour when i am expected . madame , said the young man , bowing ; i can refuse nothing asked of me thus .: 27.28
<S> the three musketeers chapter i .: 48.31
<S> what was it that you thought ? asked the young man anxiously , in his turn descending from the table .: 19.01
<S> what am i ?: 14.34
<S> what was the matter with you , baron ? d artagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais royal .: 14.69
<S> but milady felt herself denounced even by his terror .: 84.34
<S> four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of felton .: 70.65
<S> ah , you speak spanish ? enough , i think , to fulfill your highness s wishes on this occasion . meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place .: 39.67
<S> more likely he has been speculating on the bourse , and has lost money . m .: 61.29
<S> the great are often ungrateful . very true , said d artagnan , fixing his eyes , in spite of himself , on the queen s diamond , which mazarin wore on his finger .: 23.15
<S> compelled , as they were , to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight , they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive ; their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time , and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way .: 95.75
<S> at five o clock anne went to the cardinal s room .: 16.53
<S> upon hearing d artagnan s reply , aramis seemed about to draw his sword , when athos prevented him .: 39.93
<S> she looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy .: 19.13
<S> in the midst of this seeming hilarity , nevertheless , people s minds were uneasy .: 78.81
<S> remember , i have relations who possess more millions than you have deniers .: 125.42
<S> one paragraph spoke of the return of bonaparte and promised another letter and further details , on the arrival of the pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder morrel , of marseilles , whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor .: 68.92
<S> no , thank you . d artagnan trembled lest planchet , seduced , like the crow in the fable , should tell his name , and that the queen , knowing his name , would discover that planchet had belonged to him .: 36.40
<S> his desire for revenge had not forsaken him .: 51.41
<S> by jove !: 26.06
<S> we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to vampa ; he therefore went forward without a moment s hesitation , although there was no beaten track , but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes , and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half .: 55.43
<S> sir , said d avrigny to villefort , so loud that all might hear , poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late ; accustomed formerly to ride on horseback , or in the carriage , to the four corners of europe , the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed him his blood has thickened .: 106.44
<S> canst thou speak any patois ? i can do something better than that , sir , i can speak flemish . where the devil didst thou learn it ? in artois , where i fought for years .: 67.59
<S> well ? said he , on perceiving aramis .: 11.59
<S> buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut off the two studs , and avenge himself for that little treachery ; but buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman , particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy .: 71.81
<S> what do you wish , gentlemen ? who are you ? said the same voice , in the same commanding tone .: 15.52
<S> with that you may be satisfied he can make his way , both going and returning . in that case , said athos , planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going , and seven hundred livres for coming back ; and bazin , three hundred livres for going , and three hundred livres for returning that will reduce the sum to five thousand livres .: 70.30
<S> if the league which threatened france triumphed , all his influence would be lost .: 125.67
<S> what he is ; that is quite another thing .: 25.11
<S> ah , ah ! said the listener , not through doors , but through windows !: 73.43
<S> a gentleman turned around .: 65.52
<S> all at once there s a noise like a cannon that s the air blowing up the deck .: 64.49
<S> there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man , and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate .: 39.70
<S> he wished to speak , but his tongue refused to move .: 16.80
<S> thank you , she said .: 14.01
<S> enough , sir , enough .: 47.98
<S> at all events , it is best that he should follow us to athos s. aramis called bazin , and , after having ordered him to join them at athos s residence , said let us go then , at the same time taking his cloak , sword , and three pistols , opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray coin .: 40.90
<S> compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements .: 40.51
<S> exteriorly , nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbe .: 54.53
<S> i tell you i am going to die do you understand ?: 16.51
<S> there now , m. morrel , that s the whole truth , on the honor of a sailor ; is not it true , you fellows there ? a general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings .: 60.17
<S> there were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure , each by a different key .: 98.90
<S> you are examining my den , said aramis .: 26.79
<S> at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever , and when they parted , each to take the route agreed on , they turned back to utter affectionate expressions , which the echoes of the dunes repeated .: 93.70
<S> to the hotel , to be sure , to get our baggage and horses ; and from there , if it please god , to france , where , at least , i understand the architecture of the houses . so , suiting the action to the word , d artagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard , picked up his hat and ran down the stairs , followed by the others .: 40.87
<S> grimaud can take care of the horses , said planchet .: 25.67
<S> this to me , who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall , is , i assure you , a most agreeable surprise .: 80.86
<S> the other members silently dispersed .: 71.28
<S> this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor , my lord ; the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything . mazarin shuddered , but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first .: 64.39
<S> rebuff buckingham and consent to mazarin ! just like the women , replied d artagnan , coolly .: 76.73
<S> one passed at the moment , which he hailed ; he gave his address to the driver , and springing in , threw himself on the seat , and gave loose to dreams of ambition .: 64.32
<S> what is the matter ? asked albert of franz , when they had returned to their own apartments ; you seem more than commonly thoughtful . i will confess to you , albert , replied franz , the count is a very singular person , and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions . my dear fellow , exclaimed albert , what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness ?: 37.19
<S> well , at the height of his despair god assisted him through human means .: 80.75
<S> d artagnan quietly pushed him in again , and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one , keeping his eyes all the time on mordaunt s hands , who , however , knowing that it was useless , attempted no resistance .: 44.35
<S> if you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this , you might have saved yourself the trouble .: 41.65
<S> did you know him ?: 11.81
<S> d artagnan looked at the two women , one after the other , and was forced to acknowledge that in his opinion dame nature had made a mistake in their formation .: 34.13
<S> i said the origin of his fortune remained obscure .: 80.09
<S> you came , you say , to see me ? yes . well , i reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes , and that we shall see each other every day . am i , then , to remain here eternally ? demanded milady , with a certain terror .: 28.39
<S> it was caracalla s circus .: 43.77
<S> do you wish me to lend you some ? 30253m what a bad calculator you are ! exclaimed danglars , calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation .: 53.84
<S> if she flies , kill her ; but don t exceed your orders . an expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of milady ; but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning .: 45.88
<S> athos alone remained seated , calm and thoughtful .: 39.78
<S> that s not fair , said the seaman who had saved dante s ; for you know more than we do . what is that to you , jacopo ? returned the captain .: 37.04
<S> never mind , rene e , replied the marquise , with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features ; but , however all other feelings may be withered in a woman s nature , there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart , and that is the shrine of maternal love .: 53.67
<S> twice during the hundred days had morrel renewed his demand , and twice had villefort soothed him with promises .: 148.87
<S> yes , indeed , to you ; i succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained , replied monte cristo , amid the general outburst of amazement .: 53.83
<S> how ought she really to be supremely loved !: 119.23
<S> of what companion are you speaking , dear constance ? of her whose carriage was at the gate ; of a woman who calls herself your friend ; of a woman to whom you have told everything . her name , her name ! cried d artagnan .: 43.44
<S> he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la re serve , and which had the postmark , marseilles , 27th february , delivery 6 o clock , p.m. but it must be said that if he had seen it , he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper , and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs , that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do , however irregular it might be .: 57.64
<S> ah , said the count , you have , then , not forgotten that i saved your life ; that is strange , for it is a week ago . 20203m no , excellency ; and never shall i forget it , returned peppino , with an accent of profound gratitude .: 30.06
<S> d artagnan alone had discovered nothing he , ordinarily the most inventive of the four ; but it must be also said that the very name of milady paralyzed him .: 69.34
<S> no !: 15.96
<S> without having been in the school of the abbe faria , the worthy master of la jeune ame lie the name of the genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean , from the arabic to the provenc al , and this , while it spared him interpreters , persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet , gave him great facilities of communication , either with the vessels he met at sea , with the small boats sailing along the coast , or with the people without name , country , or occupation , who are always seen on the quays of seaports , and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence , as they have no visible means of support .: 82.59
<S> carmela was precisely the age and figure of teresa , and teresa was as handsome as carmela .: 72.38
<S> well , said the jeweller , as he placed himself at table , all i can say is , so much the worse for those who are abroad . yes , chimed in la carconte , they will have a wretched night of it . the jeweller began eating his supper , and the woman , who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her , was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess .: 50.70
<S> and if death be my lot , i hope to die for the king , for royalty and for god .: 59.90
<S> she lives ; she is in safety in a convent ; she is at be thune !: 42.62
<S> franz introduced me to her at rome , replied albert .: 64.35
<S> the prison register chapter 29 .: 95.94
<S> could not contain himself , and he made a step toward the queen s apartment with that pale and mute indignation which , when it broke out , led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty .: 72.78
<S> the movement was executed in silence and with precision .: 62.40
<S> but know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband , who has but the commencement of the art for generally husbands will not see you would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world .: 89.36
<S> i never was romantic , and am no melancholy hero .: 79.00
<S> anne of austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that day radiant with grace and wit .: 74.67
<S> some voices passed and faded away , and the sound of a single footstep approached the door .: 34.76
<S> explain it , athos . groslow , on the question being interpreted , answered , three , without counting myself . d artagnan understood , for while replying the captain had raised three fingers .: 133.35
<S> by its influence , time has no longer measure , space has no longer distance .: 148.22
<S> is it really for us that you mean your attack ? here he is !: 36.81
<S> should we have the same presentiments if our existences did not touch at the heart ?: 80.05
<S> well , my friend , there is not a moment to lose ; we must let the king know immediately . why , what is the matter ? it would take too long to tell you , besides , you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all .: 56.32
<S> julie was at the entrance of the garden , where she was attentively watching penelon , who , entering with zeal into his profession of gardener , was very busy grafting some bengal roses .: 73.03
<S> doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes , for the jailer said , come , are you going mad again ? dante s did not answer ; he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him .: 26.63
<S> the woman had the outline of mme .: 20.23
<S> but suppose one pass , as is permissible in philology , from the word itself to its softened synonym , then , instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination ; you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way , and that without shock or violence , without the display of the sufferings which , in the case of becoming a punishment , make a martyr of the victim , and a butcher , in every sense of the word , of him who inflicts them .: 72.18
<S> valentine carried the pastille to her mouth , and swallowed it .: 33.17
<S> the most humble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans , bless with holy water sprinklers , which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers .: 245.57
<S> quick , kitty , quick ! said d artagnan , in a low voice , as soon as the bolts were fast , let me get out of the ho tel ; for if we leave her time to turn round , she will have me killed by the servants . but you can t go out so , said kitty ; you are naked . that s true , said d artagnan , then first thinking of the costume he found himself in , that s true .: 25.90
<S> the days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in france , and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire .: 84.66
<S> come , said d artagnan to himself , i have got one more enemy . and now , said the queen , addressing d artagnan , what is to be done ?: 13.72
<S> but let us leave off this strain , sir , if the tone of it is displeasing to you ; i am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second sight . no , no , by no means , said villefort , who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground .: 36.15
<S> you notice my ring ? said the gascon , proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his friends .: 63.94
<S> you have hastened to me can i have the happiness of being useful to you ? 40286m yes , i need your help : that is i thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where god alone can succor me . tell me what it is , replied monte cristo .: 49.40
<S> all at once she heard a tap at her window , and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars .: 31.71
<S> he found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire , drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken .: 74.29
<S> and do you not perceive that in the person of this priest is represented the whole people of paris and that it is dangerous to insult him at this moment , and if this priest wished it , in an hour you would be without a crown ?: 49.47
<S> that s true , said he , quietly , for my part i have never loved . acknowledge , then , you stony heart , said d artagnan , that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts . tender hearts !: 33.48
<S> an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect , not of a downy couch , but of a tomb .: 90.26
<S> albert s attack on andrea had placed him on a different footing , and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed .: 89.87
<S> i have already told you , answered the abbe , that i loathe the idea of shedding blood . and yet the murder , if you choose to call it so , would be simply a measure of self preservation . no matter !: 48.34
<S> a good journey to ye , they cried , allowing it to pass .: 62.90
<S> m. coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted , and sighed deeply .: 79.87
<S> we let them tell their story out , replied mousqueton .: 53.06
<S> they had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends .: 75.35
<S> noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference , at the same time giving a side look at valentine , which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room .: 36.46
<S> the president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady ; but she declined availing herself of it .: 54.15
<S> tomorrow ! replied the steward .: 19.81
<S> happily marie and a follower of hers named kitty could disguise themselves admirably in men s clothes .: 169.47
<S> a nice acquaintance , my friend ! porthos , replied aramis , i have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet ; and that is injurious to you among the women . gentlemen , gentlemen , cried d artagnan , who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure , the thing is serious .: 26.54
<S> it was the plan of alexander vi .: 23.15
<S> merce de s begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for edmond . so that , said the abbe , with a bitter smile , that makes eighteen months in all .: 56.16
<S> taste this cutlet , my dear d artagnan ; tis off one of my sheep . you have very tender mutton and i wish you joy of it . said d artagnan .: 58.62
<S> his devotion to the queen was boundless ; men of loyalty are scarce . i think so , forsooth , said rochefort , and when you find any of them , you march them off to the bastile .: 68.75
<S> oho ! cried d artagnan , as he went down the steps of the hatchway , preceded by the lantern , what a number of barrels !: 28.43
<S> what can the chancellor have to say to me that your majesty could not say yourself ? the king turned upon his heel without reply , and almost at the same instant the captain of the guards , m. de guitant , announced the visit of the chancellor .: 26.79
<S> this , sir , is all i can tell you , and you see how uninteresting it is . as dante s spoke , villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance , and recollected the words of rene e , who , without knowing who the culprit was , had besought his indulgence for him .: 40.02
<S> well , said the jailer , are you more reasonable today ? dante s made no reply .: 23.77
<S> the queen will never banish me , and even were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me ; if i fly , she will fly ; and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen .: 54.82
<S> faria sat up to receive him , avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death .: 83.80
<S> if you take one step farther , d artagnan , said he , we shall cross swords together . d artagnan sank on his knees and prayed .: 20.55
<S> then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was right .: 60.23
<S> yours ! cried she , throwing back her veil , yours , which i alone , perhaps , have not forgotten .: 49.22
<S> why was i a prisoner ? i do not know , said merce de s .: 12.16
<S> gentlemen , said aramis , decidedly it is a night for meetings .: 41.22
<S> in the regiment , said d artagnan , he is called porthos the queen started , but his true name is the chevalier du vallon . de bracieux de pierrefonds , added porthos .: 32.47
<S> i have a father who is seventy if he yet lives ; i only love him and a young girl called merce de s .: 51.20
<S> i actually love no one , sir ; you know it , do you not ?: 22.14
<S> paris for two hours past had been dark , and seemed a desert .: 75.62
<S> thou hast prospered and grown stout ! and d artagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change good fortune had produced on the once famished one .: 72.48
<S> the carnival at rome .: 34.70
<S> yes ?: 53.80
<S> but would you ruin me ? if i sought your ruin , fool , i should drag you to the first guard house ; besides , when that note is delivered , in all probability you will have no more to fear .: 62.41
<S> as these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queen s appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place .: 66.72
<S> they said he was so accustomed to darkness that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon . he spent fourteen years to arrive at that , muttered the count .: 41.14
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> dear grandfather . said she hurriedly , you know poor grandmamma died an hour since , and now i have no friend in the world but you . his expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness .: 62.00
<S> the matter had been named to him by d artagnan , who in the first place pointed out the money to him , then the glory , and then the danger .: 41.90
<S> the old marshal turned toward the viscount , grateful for that praise of his son , whilst the prince exclaimed : the young man is right ; let the prisoner be brought in . meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was .: 61.87
<S> the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon .: 25.39
<S> athos required no more .: 46.12
<S> the moon is just bursting through the clouds , and there , standing where you do , and wrapped in that cloak that conceals your figure , you remind me of m. de villefort . what ! cried monte cristo , it was m. de villefort ? your excellency knows him ? the former royal attorney at ni mes ? yes . who married the marquis of saint me ran s daughter ? yes . who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe , the most upright , the most rigid magistrate on the bench ? well , monsieur , said bertuccio , this man with this spotless reputation well ? was a villain . bah , replied monte cristo , impossible ! it is as i tell you . ah , really , said monte cristo .: 39.35
<S> he ? asked athos .: 14.68
<S> yes ; we must put the madman with the madmen . the soldiers seized dante s , who followed passively .: 55.35
<S> however , continued faria , seeing that the inspector was about to depart , it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone ; the governor can be present . unfortunately , said the governor , i know beforehand what you are about to say ; it concerns your treasures , does it not ? faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity .: 29.68
<S> an hour afterward rochefort set out at a grand gallop ; five hours after that he passed through arras .: 67.03
<S> ah ! said porthos to mordaunt , i think we have you now , my hero !: 32.18
<S> i buy those horses , he said to the groom .: 29.18
<S> then obeying the orders given him by athos , he headed the small procession , bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other , until it reached de winter s inn , when pounding on the portal with his fist , he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word .: 70.85
<S> d artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting ; and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu , another interview was arranged for the following week .: 96.61
<S> such a thing is really out of rule eccentric or stupid .: 120.22
<S> there were also less agreeable visits for two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated .: 88.29
<S> it was a mistake . yes , which made fools laugh , which caused the minister to have a sleepless night , which has caused the minister s secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper , but which has cost me 700,000 francs . but , sir , said hermine suddenly , if all this is , as you say , caused by m. debray , why , instead of going direct to him , do you come and tell me of it ?: 44.15
<S> on my honor , they are not poisoned .: 23.70
<S> what was there in it ? a letter addressed to monsieur de tre ville , captain of the musketeers . indeed ! exactly as i have the honor to tell your excellency . the host , who was not endowed with great perspicacity , did not observe the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the stranger .: 25.68
<S> i have two horses , i do not count my servant s bobtailed nag .: 50.42
<S> realizing this , villefort came to the rescue of the crest fallen minister , instead of aiding to crush him .: 62.75
<S> m. coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities .: 105.31
<S> explain yourself . grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole .: 57.34
<S> what s that ? cried the duke .: 8.80
<S> a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance , which was not natural to him .: 28.45
<S> this circumstance had , moreover , the effect of changing the conversation ; an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel .: 26.70
<S> the first risk that dante s ran was , that the jailer , when he brought him his supper at seven o clock , might perceive the change that had been made ; fortunately , twenty times at least , from misanthropy or fatigue , dante s had received his jailer in bed , and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table , and went away without saying a word .: 38.13
<S> planchet , sir . lieutenant yesterday , said aramis , captain to day , colonel , doubtless , to morrow ; in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of france . question him about the fight , said athos .: 79.80
<S> since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon , let me take the place of the dead ! without giving himself time to reconsider his decision , and , indeed , that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution , he bent over the appalling shroud , opened it with the knife which faria had made , drew the corpse from the sack , and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber , laid it on his couch , tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own , covered it with his counterpane , once again kissed the ice cold brow , and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes , which glared horribly , turned the head towards the wall , so that the jailer might , when he brought the evening meal , believe that he was asleep , as was his frequent custom ; entered the tunnel again , drew the bed against the wall , returned to the other cell , took from the hiding place the needle and thread , flung off his rags , that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas , and getting inside the sack , placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid , and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside .: 68.21
<S> very good , said the count .: 8.78
<S> come , he said to himself , let me try if he will be more tractable than the other ; and he tapped gently at the door .: 18.23
<S> can it be , can it possibly be , the illustrious coxcomb , mazarin de piscina , hey ? pistache made violent signs that it was , by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times successively .: 84.57
<S> are you mad , uncle ? he called me by this name when he was in good humor ; do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode of existence my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself , exposed to the bitter frost at night , and the scorching heat by day , compelled to conceal yourself , and when you are perceived , receive a volley of bullets , all to earn a paltry sum ?: 92.43
<S> the royal procession set out for paris .: 50.97
<S> my strength is failing me ; i am dying . the voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of athos .: 71.18
<S> they soon tired of the sport .: 86.39
<S> that order does not concern me , replied milady , coldly , since it bears another name than mine . a name ?: 60.90
<S> the names have been purposely concealed ; my father himself does not know who this president was , and if he knows , he can not tell you ; proper names are not in the dictionary . oh , misery , cried franz : the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing , at least , the name of him who killed my father !: 66.06
<S> do you promise ? i swear to you i will . it is well .: 24.94
<S> marvelous !: 104.31
<S> at last he made his way through the mob , which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent , and reached the hotel .: 45.40
<S> well , then , you shall see it now . in a second d artagnan had made three terrible thrusts at mordaunt , all of which touched , but only pricked him .: 63.71
<S> on whom do my hopes rest ?: 95.72
<S> besides , according to all probability they will wait at the door . d artagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive .: 31.65
<S> because you think i am drunk ?: 37.61
<S> having been brought up on the banks of the loire , he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves ; a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback , a thousand times had swum across .: 44.36
<S> the burglary the day following that on which the conversation we have related took place , the count of monte cristo set out for auteuil , accompanied by ali and several attendants , and also taking with him some horses whose qualities he was desirous of ascertaining .: 70.37
<S> at the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay ; this yacht had been built by order of an englishman , who , having heard that the genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the mediterranean in the construction of fast sailing vessels , was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill ; the price agreed upon between the englishman and the genoese builder was forty thousand francs .: 74.04
<S> come to me ! d artagnan began to be touched .: 14.60
<S> take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours . they approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay .: 72.45
<S> a small , low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street , the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters , and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the one half per cent it had originally paid .: 156.07
<S> yes , i shall pay , if , as i hope , my vessel arrives safely ; for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents , of which i have been the victim , have deprived me ; but if the pharaon should be lost , and this last resource be gone the poor man s eyes filled with tears .: 49.64
<S> the englishman appeared to reflect a moment , and then said , from which it would appear , sir , that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension ? to tell you the truth , i consider it lost . well , then , i will buy it of you ! you ? yes , i ! but at a tremendous discount , of course ? no , for two hundred thousand francs .: 38.29
<S> perhaps . and how is your wrist ? better ; but do you think that we ve got them this time ? got what ? you your command , and i my title ? i faith !: 93.65
<S> gentlemen , he said , the wood that i am carting is his ; i cut it in his copse and i am taking it to the chateau . d artagnan determined not to question this man ; he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to planchet .: 44.34
<S> but for the honor of the king of the queen . well , let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor , said the queen .: 19.09
<S> in the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim : are you playing with justice , accused , and do you dare set your fellow citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled ? several persons hurried up to m. de villefort , who sat half bowed over in his chair , offering him consolation , encouragement , and protestations of zeal and sympathy .: 83.93
<S> by general oliver cromwell .: 38.36
<S> i have heard speak of a mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in question .: 80.58
<S> whilst he thus hesitated the host re entered the room , followed not only by a surgeon , but by many other persons , whom curiosity had attracted to the spot .: 86.25
<S> let us sit down . villefort fell , rather than seated himself .: 36.96
<S> i remember well that the slaves , convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives , passed whole days and nights in praying , crying , and groaning .: 106.42
<S> i will no longer detain you , m. de villefort , for you must be fatigued after so long a journey ; go and rest .: 29.57
<S> precisely what i was about to say , cried danglars .: 21.53
<S> it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers that there is a sun .: 55.11
<S> but to return to the charming musicians you should give us a treat , danglars , without telling them there is a stranger .: 58.06
<S> true , the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices ; but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance .: 118.60
<S> the apparition chapter 101 .: 40.91
<S> it was very hard . the horse ? said morcerf , laughing .: 37.80
<S> i wished to make my adieux to you , but time does not permit .: 49.38
<S> d artagnan picked it up ; by good luck it had not been extinguished .: 41.80
<S> come , said he , laughing , there are all my hopes about to be destroyed . how so ? asked beauchamp .: 19.31
<S> what should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let mazarin go ? why , i should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily . bravo , porthos !: 47.97
<S> you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary , compressed , marked up , nonproprietary or proprietary form , including any word processing or hypertext form .: 44.89
<S> madame , said he , if i dared in my turn advise would it be to give up broussel , sir ?: 42.62
<S> bayonne ? yes ; the road to bayonne . and afterwards the road to cha tillon ? yes . by the tower of montlhe ry , you mean ? yes . thank you .: 43.30
<S> richelieu , as everyone knows , had loved the queen .: 47.27
<S> moreover , you are our prisoners . fool ! cried aramis ; knowest thou not , then , mordaunt ?: 39.48
<S> it may , therefore , be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum , that wonder of all ages , which martial thus eulogizes : let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids , and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us ; all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the c sars , and the many voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument . as for albert and franz , they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants ; and , indeed , it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage , as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands .: 92.05
<S> yes , it is so long ago , answered porthos .: 14.43
<S> you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg license when you share it without charge with others .: 27.04
<S> now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign , with full license and privilege . never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly majesty .: 271.84
<S> is the spot far from here ? a hundred leagues . it is not ill planned , said the governor .: 45.44
<S> come , my lord , you shall be treated like a prince , as you are . a fallen prince ! exclaimed mazarin , piteously .: 35.30
<S> franz and albert were like men who , to drive away a violent sorrow , have recourse to wine , and who , as they drink and become intoxicated , feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present .: 75.02
<S> as to the king , he made no demonstration of politeness , only stopping before the queen .: 31.95
<S> once concealed with her at armentie res , it would be easy to make her believe that d artagnan had not come to be thune .: 29.07
<S> in short , he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins , when suddenly , in the direction of the rue de l arbre sec , the crowd opened , crying : long live the coadjutor ! and gondy , in surplice and cloak , appeared , moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left , as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the fete dieu .: 60.10
<S> then he had run to the train , impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge , and full of confidence , as are those whom god blinds , he had set fire to the wick of nitre .: 69.95
<S> leave me , i command you . carlini obeyed , rejoined his comrades , folded himself in his cloak , and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest .: 33.07
<S> and the four friends , guided by mousqueton , took up the way toward the house , already almost restored to their former gayety ; for they were now , as athos had said , all four once more united and of single mind .: 60.32
<S> but by what means ?: 22.05
<S> most decidedly , said he , men are not equal , and i must beg my father to develop this theorem in the chamber of peers . chapter 42 .: 50.21
<S> nothing of all this escaped grimaud , but la ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children .: 68.04
<S> all the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement .: 34.96
<S> i forgot , said athos , laughing .: 13.86
<S> the sergeant of this company , a veteran of the spanish wars , had recognized porthos , his old companion , and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of tre ville .: 65.30
<S> having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinal s cloak , he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road , and having lost sight of them , he returned at a gallop to the inn , which was opened to him without hesitation .: 32.31
<S> ah ! said gondy , reflecting , you are right , sir ; some one who could raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of paris ; some one who would know how to cry aloud to them , that all france might hear it , that it is mazarin who has reduced them to poverty . exactly your man . bravo !: 70.30
<S> but , as you know , a corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance , so his carriage , fast as it went , was never above half a day s journey before me , who followed him on foot .: 71.68
<S> the rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental ideas ; the floors were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce ; the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture ; while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed , with piles of soft and yielding cushions , that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose .: 129.88
<S> it was forty eight hours since i had taken any nourishment .: 40.58
<S> listen to me .: 17.52
<S> a second time he was disappointed in his expectation .: 32.90
<S> and he took hold of one within his reach ; his two companions did the same thing .: 42.64
<S> chevalier , he continued , addressing aramis , who , leaning proudly on his sword , seemed to agree with his companion , chevalier , porthos and i run no risk ; besides , should any ill luck happen to two of us , will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended ?: 63.77
<S> in four days time the shore will be beneath your feet , the sea will be open to you more open than will perhaps be agreeable to you , for in four days england will be relieved of you . milady folded her hands , and raising her fine eyes toward heaven , lord , lord , said she , with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone , pardon this man , as i myself pardon him . yes , pray , accursed woman ! cried the baron ; your prayer is so much the more generous from your being , i swear to you , in the power of a man who will never pardon you ! and he went out .: 53.33
<S> some of that at the bottom , near the laths .: 90.61
<S> however , i shall have no occasion to work , for the little sum of money buried by you , and which i found in the place you mentioned , will be sufficient to maintain me .: 32.89
<S> franz congratulated albert , who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited .: 44.09
<S> but drink some of this ; and the count took a bottle from his pocket , containing a red liquid , of which he poured a few drops into the glass .: 28.21
<S> i swear before god , who seeth us , and who , in the darkness of this night heareth us , never shall my sword cross yours , never my eye express a glance of anger , nor my heart a throb of hatred , at you .: 104.36
<S> they sat silent and dejected .: 47.05
<S> he was received by baptistin .: 19.47
<S> the audience m. de tre ville was at the moment in rather ill humor , nevertheless he saluted the young man politely , who bowed to the very ground ; and he smiled on receiving d artagnan s response , the be arnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country a double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages ; but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to d artagnan with his hand , as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him , he called three times , with a louder voice at each time , so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent .: 56.04
<S> monsieur du tremblay received d artagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper , of which he was himself about to partake .: 29.23
<S> he had received in the chest the bullet of d artagnan s first adversary .: 32.45
<S> your offer , however , smooths all difficulties , and i have only to ask you , my dear m. de morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile , whether you undertake , upon my arrival in france , to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin china ? oh , that i do , and with infinite pleasure , answered albert ; and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris , in consequence of a treaty of marriage my dear franz , do not smile , i beg of you with a family of high standing , and connected with the very cream of parisian society . connected by marriage , you mean , said franz , laughingly .: 55.64
<S> if d artagnan forgets his host , or appears to forget him , under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried , we will not forget him , and we know where he is .: 38.50
<S> mademoiselle de villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of saint me ran ; i say hers , for she inherits it today .: 69.91
<S> adieu , sir , she said .: 10.64
<S> the idea of suicide , which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence , now hovered like a phantom over the abbe s dead body .: 82.30
<S> though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion , when once seated he recovered himself , as it were , and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape .: 69.61
<S> no .: 17.05
<S> then the king , who , without our suspecting it , had overheard our conversation , interrupted us by saying , villefort observe that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier , but , on the contrary , placed considerable emphasis on that of villefort villefort , said his majesty , is a young man of great judgment and discretion , who will be sure to make a figure in his profession ; i like him much , and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the son in law of the marquis and marquise de saint me ran .: 42.02
<S> upon my word , said monte cristo , paris is a strange city , and the parisians a very singular people .: 28.68
<S> he was , however , forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they employed .: 104.18
<S> when the hour for his jailer s visit arrived , dante s straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could , and placed it in its accustomed place .: 43.39
<S> i would make your fortune . how ?: 36.91
<S> we thought it dead , he repeated ; i placed it in the chest , which was to take the place of a coffin ; i descended to the garden , i dug a hole , and then flung it down in haste .: 32.31
<S> has your husband any spanish bonds ? he asked of the baroness .: 55.86
<S> all his furniture consisted of a bed , a chair , a table , a pail , and a jug .: 36.53
<S> here , said he , leaning heavily on the arm of monte cristo , here is the spot where my father stopped , when the pharaon entered the port ; it was here that the good old man , whom you saved from death and dishonor , threw himself into my arms .: 30.00
<S> monsieur le prince is led by the coadjutor , who is led by madame de guemenee . therefore , madame , i ask you to look , not among your friends of to day , but among those of other times . among my friends of other times ? said the queen .: 43.50
<S> fontrailles , his aide de camp , had an arm broken ; his horse had received a bullet in his neck and he had difficulty in controlling him , maddened by pain .: 106.44
<S> the king is with us and his generals are the duke of orleans and the prince de conde , although i must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs . yes , answered athos , but his right place is in our ranks , with the prince de conti , de beaufort , d elbeuf , and de bouillon ; but , sir , supposing that the conference is broken off are you going to try to take charenton ? such are my orders . sir , since you command the cavalry pardon me , i am commander in chief . so much the better .: 63.48
<S> here we are , said monte cristo ; it is only half past ten o clock , come in . certainly , i will . my carriage shall take you back . no , thank you ; i gave orders for my coupe to follow me . there it is , then , said monte cristo , as he stepped out of the carriage .: 19.55
<S> the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which i am here . he then made a sign for mousqueton to come to him .: 28.74
<S> oh , no , edmond , it is myself that i blame , myself that i hate !: 40.85
<S> eh ?: 58.00
<S> it has so chanced that i met with a spaniard in my peregrinations who had seen many countries , and among them the new world . what connection can the new world have with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe ? patience , monsieur , everything will come in its turn . this spaniard had in his service a lackey who had accompanied him in his voyage to mexico .: 72.63
<S> you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that , ever since i have known this man , i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him .: 46.72
<S> it was now one o clock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home .: 11.43
<S> but , while we are speaking of business , danglars added , pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject , tell me what i am to do for m. cavalcanti . give him money , if he is recommended to you , and the recommendation seems good . excellent ; he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40,000 francs , payable at sight , on you , signed by busoni , and returned by you to me , with your endorsement of course , i immediately counted him over the forty bank notes . monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent .: 50.83
<S> he saw me this morning for the first time , and has already forgotten he has seen me .: 21.02
<S> orders had just been given to the royal guards and the swiss guards , not only to stand firm , but to send out patrols to the streets of saint denis and saint martin , where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous , when the mayor of paris was announced at the palais royal .: 45.53
<S> mistrust everybody , your friend , your brother , your mistress your mistress above all . d artagnan blushed .: 56.02
<S> ma foi ! said monte cristo , after the first compliments were over , what is the matter with you , m. de villefort ?: 18.01
<S> tell the king that if he sleeps badly to night he will sleep better to morrow night . these blunt words , so terrible if taken literally , were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter .: 105.17
<S> rest assured , gentlemen , that within three days , in a less time than justice would demand , the revenge i shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble ; and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth , and grasped the old man s senseless hand .: 60.69
<S> the boy , the hostess , and all the house had the same regard for d artagnan that one would have for hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve labors .: 94.24
<S> here is what i am looking for , thought d artagnan ; but alas !: 20.24
<S> the calumniator is not yet punished , and he may hope that he will not be ; but , on my honor , if he thinks so , he deceives himself . well , listen , morcerf . ah , beauchamp , i see you know something already ; you will restore me to life . i do not say there is any truth in what i am going to tell you , but it is , at least , a ray of light in a dark night ; by following it we may , perhaps , discover something more certain . tell me ; satisfy my impatience . well , i will tell you what i did not like to mention on my return from yanina . say on . i went , of course , to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries .: 38.77
<S> sir , we don t keep any , was the reply of the people who opened the doors ; but please ask at the hay dealer s. where is the hay dealer s ? at the last large door in the street . are there any other people in saint germain who sell straw ? yes ; there s the landlord of the lamb , and gros louis the farmer ; they both live in the rue des ursulines . very well . d artagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw , which he obtained , at the rate of three pistoles each .: 60.01
<S> d artagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge .: 33.76
<S> i say that he doesn t suit me at all , said porthos , and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramis s advice . by no means , my dear porthos ; that man is a messenger of general cromwell ; it would insure for us a poor reception , i imagine , should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant . nevertheless , said porthos , i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice . listen , returned d artagnan , when our embassy is finished well ? if it brings us back to france well ? well , we shall see . at that moment the two friends reached the hotel , arms of england , where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port .: 44.31
<S> i tell you that the dose has been double , the poison changed , and that this time it has succeeded .: 38.09
<S> you may copy it , give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at www.gutenberg.org .: 8.75
<S> oh , yes , i assure you , count , they want nothing that can render them happy ; they are young and cheerful , they are tenderly attached to each other , and with twenty five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild . five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum , however , replied monte cristo , with a tone so sweet and gentle , that it went to maximilian s heart like the voice of a father ; but they will not be content with that .: 32.63
<S> a woman could go up a ladder like that . aramis s searching look seemed to seek his friend s thought even at the bottom of his heart , but d artagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity .: 47.69
<S> indeed , sir , said he to albert , if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because i have preferred him to you , i shall resign the case to the king s attorney . you mistake , sir , said morcerf with a gloomy smile ; i am not referring in the least to matrimony , and i only addressed myself to m. cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us .: 38.96
<S> m. de tre ville requested athos , whatever might happen , to be observant of his duty to the king , but particularly to the queen , begging him to convey his desires to his comrades .: 37.93
<S> he knocked , and it opened immediately to admit him .: 43.74
<S> this athos , then , was a very extraordinary man .: 23.91
<S> at length the reading of the indictment was ended .: 23.60
<S> in the proper time and place i will remember everything .: 79.50
<S> oh , how happy you make us !: 33.07
<S> yes , said noirtier .: 8.89
<S> the house is sold , then ? demanded the concierge ; and this gentleman is coming to live here ? yes , my friend , returned the count ; and i will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master . oh , monsieur , said the concierge , i shall not have much cause to regret him , for he came here but seldom ; it is five years since he was here last , and he did well to sell the house , for it did not bring him in anything at all . what was the name of your old master ? said monte cristo .: 27.80
<S> after ten minutes expectation the clock struck ten ; at the fifth stroke the door opened and lord wilmore appeared .: 45.00
<S> tell me at least the means . my husband had been at liberty these two or three days .: 38.42
<S> creating the works from print editions not protected by u.s. copyright law means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works , so the foundation and you !: 24.03
<S> he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been , and was now to find out what the man had become .: 48.81
<S> one of my friends one of my friends , please to observe , not myself , said athos , interrupting himself with a melancholy smile , one of the counts of my province that is to say , of berry noble as a dandolo or a montmorency , at twenty five years of age fell in love with a girl of sixteen , beautiful as fancy can paint .: 51.60
<S> he could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features , the only defect , or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor .: 53.69
<S> oh , i assure you , sir , it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures , destined by their talents for higher stations , toiling together , and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house , taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three .: 78.56
<S> if he were minister and i were his d artagnan , instead of belonging to that beast of a mazarin , mordieu !: 114.27
<S> he will not go today , said d artagnan ; but here , i ll pay you for us two . in that case let us go , said the shipmaster .: 22.49
<S> this marriage , added madame de villefort , is quite agreeable to the wishes of m. d e pinay and his family ; besides , he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt , his mother having died at his birth , and his father having been assassinated in 1815 , that is to say , when he was but two years old ; it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits , and he has , therefore , seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will . that assassination was a mysterious affair , said villefort , and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection , although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person . noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile .: 48.05
<S> it was only a way of speaking .: 24.75
<S> you would fight only by broad daylight , warn your foe before an attack , and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness . athos smiled .: 110.09
<S> the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart .: 13.02
<S> fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen .: 56.92
<S> cardinal , i must have the queen s papers . but how to take them , sire ?: 43.69
<S> trial it was a stormy and dark night ; vast clouds covered the heavens , concealing the stars ; the moon would not rise till midnight .: 80.74
<S> these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous , observed d artagnan to porthos and went on his way .: 32.97
<S> when at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn , a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man and a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath ; then , fixing his eyes upon grimaud with a singular expression , the dying man uttered the last death rattle and expired .: 62.36
<S> at this moment the clock of la samaritaine struck six ; the four friends pleaded an engagement , and took leave of m. de tre ville .: 22.77
<S> at the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the palais royal , a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to cardinal mazarin .: 27.56
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> then , having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything , he went down again to noirtier , shut the doors carefully , and after convincing himself that no one was listening : do you , said he , know anything of this young lady s illness ? yes , said the old man .: 39.51
<S> he resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal , and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were dead .: 24.78
<S> d artagnan related his story simply , with the omission of names .: 84.74
<S> but it is not my fault , as i shall endeavor to prove . everyone listened eagerly ; monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips , was about to speak .: 41.85
<S> singular man ! muttered gondy , taking his hat to go away ; but on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the door .: 53.52
<S> with regard to athos , he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop ; only instead of following the road , he went across the fields , urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to listen .: 36.86
<S> he came toward teresa in high spirits , and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening .: 38.18
<S> oh ! cried porthos ; what s the matter now ?: 21.61
<S> and now , resumed bertuccio , your excellency may , perhaps , be able to comprehend that this place , which i revisit for the first time this garden , the actual scene of my crime must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature , and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency , who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause .: 63.36
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> a police agent entered .: 70.26
<S> now i recollect what ? to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at pe re pamphile s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding .: 105.67
<S> in a moment he had passed through them , and could see the house distinctly .: 29.56
<S> all that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard .: 118.84
<S> but the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you , and here are monsieur de flamarens and monsieur de chatillon , who bring me from her majesty the queen anne of austria , the very latest intelligence . aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness , even the gayety of the queen s manner .: 42.03
<S> yours is a noble nature . he said ; here is your sword . raoul bent his knee to the ground .: 36.00
<S> i have the note , said he to athos and to his friends .: 24.67
<S> now i can not be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who can not speak , and as the object of his desire or his repugnance can not be clearly proved to me , on account of his want of speech , my services here would be quite useless , and can not be legally exercised . the notary then prepared to retire .: 58.09
<S> well , continued the latter , since that heart is no longer with you in the bois de vincennes , it is elsewhere , and i must go and find it . go , said the count deliberately ; go , dear friend , but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that i have some power in this world , that i am happy to use that power in the behalf of those i love , and that i love you , morrel . 40260m i will remember it , said the young man , as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid .: 44.63
<S> but no matter ; we must trust in god . as soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors , who , boat hook in hand , began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were involved .: 49.49
<S> let him follow me ; i will take him to his cell . go ! said the gendarmes , thrusting dante s forward .: 29.73
<S> bonacieux away , and convey her to a place of safety , and there , if matters required , make her a hostage .: 74.94
<S> bonacieux at home it was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the king .: 41.07
<S> here , said he , is a proof of my satisfaction . at this epoch , the ideas of pride which are in fashion in our days did not prevail .: 41.49
<S> he laughs best who laughs last .: 312.39
<S> however , as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance , and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment , a new misfortune befell them ; the gallery on the sea side , which had long been in ruins , was rebuilt .: 85.50
<S> i know all these things .: 15.23
<S> at the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassin s wrist , and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers , and caderousse uttered a cry of pain .: 32.90
<S> without doubt the chancellor se guier looked about at that moment for the rope of the famous bell ; but not finding it he summoned his resolution , and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the queen had acknowledged the paper was to be found .: 59.61
<S> so would you ! said mazarin , looking with astonishment at those two men .: 30.49
<S> the vessel was quite ready to sail , and the captain was waiting on the wharf .: 24.99
<S> you surprise me ! exclaimed the monarch .: 33.17
<S> in one respect you are right , for i am ready to quarrel with everyone today ; but you have the first claim , m. danglars . 40212m sir , replied danglars , pale with anger and fear , i warn you , when i have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog , i kill it ; and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime , i believe i do society a kindness .: 50.45
<S> besides , you know , i had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when i came to france .: 35.93
<S> at another time , added he , i should have said , give them , besides , two hundred francs over as a present ; but times are changed , and the little money that remains to me is not my own , so do not think me mean on this account . penelon turned to his companions , and exchanged a few words with them .: 47.98
<S> it is true , however , that it was the shorter and easier part .: 24.26
<S> what is your name ? i shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me , my lord , or my prince , as it may suit you best to be called , said our gascon , who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat .: 36.59
<S> what the devil could that handkerchief signify ? placed where he was , d artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis .: 39.23
<S> she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless .: 29.02
<S> aramis and his thesis chapter xxvii .: 29.40
<S> never mind , continued the young man , smuggler or not , you must agree , mother dear , as you have seen him , that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man , who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris .: 20.58
<S> why ? an apology on the ground ! said the young captain , shaking his head .: 21.64
<S> my lord has forgotten the supper . no , but i have forgotten monsieur grimaud . my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present . go on , then ; have it your own way . come here , my lad , said la ramee , and hear what i have to say . grimaud approached , with a very sullen expression on his face .: 33.48
<S> sir , said monte cristo to him , i do not recommend my pictures to you , who possess such splendid paintings ; but , nevertheless , here are two by hobbema , a paul potter , a mieris , two by gerard douw , a raphael , a van dyck , a zurbaran , and two or three by murillo , worth looking at . stay , said debray ; i recognize this hobbema . ah , indeed ! yes ; it was proposed for the museum . which , i believe , does not contain one ? said monte cristo .: 51.20
<S> he will set out upon receiving an order from me , without knowing what he carries , and he will carry your majesty s letter , without even knowing it is from your majesty , to the address which is on it . the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion , gazed at her as if to read her very heart , and , seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes , embraced her tenderly .: 38.60
<S> i must know , so that i may assist you if there is any chance . i know nothing about it , continued aramis , but the cleverest , the bravest , the most devoted of us four said to me when i left him , tell the king that to morrow at ten o clock at night , we shall carry him off . he has said it and will do it . tell me the name of that generous friend , said the king , that i may cherish for him an eternal gratitude , whether he succeeds or not . d artagnan , sire , the same who had so nearly rescued you when colonel harrison made his untimely entrance . you are , indeed , wonderful men , said the king ; if such things had been related to me i should not have believed them . now , sire , resumed aramis , listen to me .: 42.95
<S> the domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands .: 63.56
<S> from my earliest recollections , i have been beloved by no one so much the worse ; that has naturally led me to love no one so much the better now you have my profession of faith . then , said danglars , pale with anger , which was not at all due to offended paternal love , then , mademoiselle , you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin ? your ruin ?: 63.04
<S> well , do you understand , monsieur ?: 9.96
<S> have you never seen anyone enter your room at night ? oh , yes ; i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me , approach , and disappear ; but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination , and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium . then you do not know who it is that attempts your life ? 50073m no , said valentine ; who could desire my death ? you shall know it now , then , said monte cristo , listening .: 53.66
<S> while yet young , unfortunately handsome , i was dragged into a snare .: 83.57
<S> what is the matter , then ? he asked .: 5.78
<S> the bottle was covered with spiders webs , and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man s face .: 86.71
<S> pardieu !: 27.02
<S> friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts , d artagnan .: 250.18
<S> and how did it happen ? i will tell you all about it , replied mousqueton .: 13.92
<S> the fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch , to which it had retired to die of old age .: 36.22
<S> some of the inmates of the lions den were watching the operations of the prisoner s toilet with considerable interest .: 52.32
<S> athos had a noble heart , and made , therefore , but a poor courtier .: 35.75
<S> thank you , d artagnan , said comminges , showing half of his body through the window of the broken vehicle , thanks , my young friend ; your name that i may mention it to the queen . raoul was about to reply when d artagnan bent down to his ear .: 29.95
<S> having aroused the enmity of the sultan , he was proscribed and put to death by treachery in 1822 , at the age of eighty . ed .: 74.21
<S> mordaunt remained standing near the door .: 15.29
<S> do you wish to assassinate a man who , in the eyes of heaven , is a brother ?: 19.05
<S> if you have two coats you will give me one of them .: 21.98
<S> and can not women be dishonored by appearances ?: 120.26
<S> this kind of life fatigues and oppresses me ; besides , he is a turbulent fellow , who will ruin our party .: 59.01
<S> i have resolved to fly with you , not a word be ready .: 34.80
<S> as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person , he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information .: 96.52
<S> they hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose ; at length valentine ventured .: 91.58
<S> and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts , harmonizing as ours do , and almost miraculously brought us together , to separate us at last . those are kind and cheering words .: 126.38
<S> i am not in any want , thank god , my living is suited to my means .: 64.66
<S> but this is not to the purpose , our business concerns valentine , let us leave the dead in peace . all this was said with such exceeding rapidity , that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium .: 49.98
<S> in that case , my lord , the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand ; my lord , in three days , if you wish it , my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be cardinal . the coadjutor started .: 33.68
<S> she joined her hands with a suppliant air , but without venturing to speak a word .: 29.84
<S> d artagnan was a woman , and still more , a mother .: 29.52
<S> good bye , said cha teau renaud in his turn , keeping his little cane in his left hand , and saluting with his right .: 19.01
<S> there are the prince de conti , the duc de longueville , the duc de beaufort , the duc de bouillon , the marechal de la mothe , the marquis de sevigne , and i don t know who , for my part . and the vicomte raoul de bragelonne ? inquired athos , in a tremulous voice .: 14.00
<S> you accept this young lady as your interpreter , m. noirtier ? yes . well , sir , what do you require of me , and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up ? valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to w. at this letter the eloquent eye of noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop .: 41.45
<S> who was it you were talking with over there ? she asked .: 68.32
<S> and then , besides , the useless blood !: 50.72
<S> i wish every respect to be shown the count , although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen . my lord , answered comminges , he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur d artagnan is confined that is , in the hunting lodge , opposite the orangery . mazarin thought for an instant .: 40.12
<S> the time and place are but ill suited for an introduction . said albert ; but we are not superstitious .: 88.77
<S> yes ; but why don t you come there also ? athos colored a little and answered : should i go , i shall be delighted to see you there . halloo , planchet ! cried the gascon from the door , we must set out in ten minutes ; give the horses some hay . then turning to athos he added : i seem to miss something here .: 44.83
<S> when the reading was finished , he remained silent , with knitted brows .: 31.76
<S> milady was wrong in fearing that mme .: 46.76
<S> cucumetto had violated thy daughter , said the bandit ; i loved her , therefore i slew her ; for she would have served as the sport of the whole band . the old man spoke not , and grew pale as death .: 58.12
<S> albert s lips scarcely whispered good bye , but his look was more explicit ; it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger , proud disdain , and generous indignation .: 119.46
<S> who could intercept us on such a night as this , pitch dark , when one does not see more than twenty yards before one ? yes , but to morrow morning to morrow we shall be at boulogne . i hope so , with all my heart , said the gascon , and i confess my weakness .: 52.97
<S> bonacieux indeed reflected on what had just been said to him .: 76.60
<S> good ! said d artagnan , rising and brushing his knees ; now i have thee thou art a frondeur and the lover of madame de longueville . chapter x. monsieur porthos du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds .: 36.67
<S> truth compelled franz , in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count , to confess that the advantage was not on pastrini s side .: 55.11
<S> villefort sprang into the room , ran to valentine , and took her in his arms .: 12.29
<S> you tell me he burned the letter ? he did ; saying at the same time , you see i thus destroy the only proof existing against you . this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural . you think so ? i am sure of it .: 46.16
<S> you know i have made the most of my arms , though i never forgot my origin . a proof of great humility or great pride , said monte cristo .: 38.06
<S> mousqueton was a norman , whose pacific name of boniface his master had changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of mousqueton .: 111.72
<S> by the way , said athos , take some pains with your toilet , raoul ; i want you to be approved . i hope , sir , replied the youth , smiling , that there s no idea of a marriage for me ; you know of my engagement to louise ? athos , in his turn , smiled also .: 39.55
<S> and , sir , continued the wounded man , i suffer much and would like , if possible , to be carried to some house . where you can be relieved ? asked de guiche .: 36.05
<S> so much the worse for you , for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage .: 30.06
<S> no , you do not know me ; i have done all in my power to oppose it . ah , i understand , said beauchamp , on our friend albert s account . on my account ? said the young man ; oh , no , indeed , the count will do me the justice to assert that i have , on the contrary , always entreated him to break off my engagement , and happily it is ended .: 25.36
<S> at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step ; then restrained himself , and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment .: 44.56
<S> if i am not mistaken those are citizens , helmeted and mailed , armed with good muskets , as in the time of the league , and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much ; and now come to the other side what do you see ?: 85.55
<S> it was six o clock in the morning , the dawn was just breaking , and its feeble ray came into the dungeon , and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp .: 28.53
<S> his mother ! he repeated .: 17.01
<S> in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best .: 62.31
<S> kitty s detention was not long .: 45.67
<S> lord de winter died without revealing anything to his brother .: 33.08
<S> he had advanced at first , but stopped at the sight of this display of force .: 26.07
<S> you love me , you ! cried he .: 13.43
<S> could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me ? how , dear sister ! said lord de winter .: 37.97
<S> your power is great , i know ; but you also know that with the help of god men have often conquered the most terrible demons .: 57.34
<S> it would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel upon such horses . well , my dear aramis , you may enjoy that pleasure , for one of those three horses is yours . ah , bah !: 38.14
<S> well , gentlemen , said the brave captain , i hope you have been well amused during your excursion . prodigiously , replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades .: 40.98
<S> never ! cried d artagnan .: 8.60
<S> on my right i saw the tree , behind me the rock .: 52.95
<S> yes , we will fly ; i will confess all to her , i will tell her daily that i also have committed a crime ! oh , what an alliance the tiger and the serpent ; worthy wife of such as i am !: 76.04
<S> yes , but never with the same advantages , said d artagnan , in a tone of raillery ; for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight . very good , very good , said the voice .: 23.85
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> yes , keep it keep it . monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say , come , reflect ; if you repent there is still time . no , said danglars , no , decidedly no ; keep my signatures .: 55.74
<S> morrel , overpowered , turned around in the armchair ; a delicious torpor permeated every vein .: 85.79
<S> his name , or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name , reached him .: 63.28
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded .: 78.66
<S> let her alone , said he .: 21.80
<S> oh , as i told you before , i think the old fellow is very close . come , you do not flatter him . i scarcely know him ; i think i have seen him three times in my life ; all i know relating to him is through busoni and himself .: 43.39
<S> another , older and less strong than he , had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake , and had failed only because of an error in calculation .: 78.32
<S> apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls , i believe , but very common among men . madame de villefort appeared more and more thoughtful .: 92.19
<S> in an instant he was among the branches , and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion .: 37.68
<S> my friend ! cried athos , suddenly , where have you brought us ?: 24.17
<S> jesus seigneur ! no sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and athos and aramis rushed out .: 41.01
<S> there , however , ended the signs which might have confounded her with a lady of rank .: 42.62
<S> the matter was to ascertain , by reconnoitering , how the enemy guarded this bastion .: 87.65
<S> then , in spite of the wind and rain , he fell into the deep , sweet sleep of utter exhaustion .: 39.14
<S> and me , too ! said aramis .: 14.09
<S> athos smiled .: 12.79
<S> well , said she ; if you love me , grandpapa , try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment .: 39.79
<S> he must wait .: 36.23
<S> pray , do people get into a passion at random at noisy ?: 159.82
<S> motionless against the dark tapestry , with her hair in disorder , she appeared like a horrid image of terror .: 58.23
<S> but listen ; they appear to be speaking of me . d artagnan drew near the window , and lent his ear .: 28.01
<S> he ran towards her .: 19.56
<S> the queen saving us , her friends ; nothing more moral .: 56.63
<S> peppino mounted the seat behind .: 96.46
<S> and athos i don t see athos .: 50.97
<S> this was more than poor bonacieux could endure , depressed as he was by the successive emotions which he had experienced ; he uttered a feeble groan which might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man , and fainted .: 46.10
<S> well , by means of these lines , which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth , and the ellipse it describes round the sun , i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch ; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements , while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths . this last explanation was wholly lost upon dante s , who had always imagined , from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean , that it moved , and not the earth .: 72.65
<S> d artagnan , as we have said , perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase .: 37.02
<S> look attentively , then , at this gentleman . the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on morrel .: 50.13
<S> both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was about .: 34.77
<S> the door opened , and d artagnan went into the chamber .: 7.05
<S> it was said at this moment that danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs , and had unlimited credit .: 41.42
<S> they do not want my papers , said monte cristo , they want to kill me ; they are no robbers , but assassins .: 36.46
<S> you have befouled the face of your king .: 38.95
<S> but even if you had caused me to wait a little while , i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours . your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking , said the man ; i came here direct from the castle of st. angelo , and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo . and who is beppo ? oh , beppo is employed in the prison , and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holiness s castle . indeed !: 50.11
<S> a deathlike silence reigned in the room above .: 56.36
<S> marie michon was a very aristocratic person ; like her sister the queen , she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen ; she resolved , therefore , to seek hospitality of the priest . athos paused .: 56.12
<S> take what precautions you please , if it is any satisfaction to you to do so ; but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve i seek . remember , the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow , and that you have but one day to work in . and what of that ?: 53.47
<S> you were only a charming man before , but , if you accede to my proposal , you will be adorable . what must i do to attain such sublimity ? you are today free as air come and dine with me ; we shall be a small party only yourself , my mother , and i .: 70.24
<S> one step farther into rest , two , perhaps , into silence .: 129.53
<S> i hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble , or else , i warn you , i will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion .: 54.98
<S> a fine prize , friend mordaunt ; we have both myself and monsieur du vallon , taken two knights of the garter , nothing less . but , said mordaunt , looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes , these are frenchmen , i imagine . i faith , i don t know .: 45.47
<S> edmond was intensely interested .: 79.91
<S> describe him , in order that , if we meet him by chance , like jean sbogar or lara , we may recognize him . you could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points , for i knew him when he was a child , and one day that i fell into his hands , going from ferentino to alatri , he , fortunately for me , recollected me , and set me free , not only without ransom , but made me a present of a very splendid watch , and related his history to me . let us see the watch , said albert .: 62.52
<S> if i had any money , said d artagnan to himself , i would go away ; but i have none .: 14.95
<S> meanwhile , come along with us ; and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly . alas , resistance was far from my thoughts .: 92.42
<S> the others withdrew .: 35.91
<S> my god , it is i i and this fellow who will help me to avenge myself . chapter lvi .: 41.49
<S> no , positively i will not go .: 31.76
<S> julie , said he to her , cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs ; that completes the 250,000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains .: 48.70
<S> sir , said villefort , striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotion , sir , you are deceived ; no one commits crimes here .: 51.57
<S> the landlord sent out for every description of garment , as if he wanted to fit up his wardrobe .: 97.28
<S> do you hear how they sleep ? he asked .: 20.93
<S> the hostess replied only by gasps .: 86.14
<S> good god !: 19.64
<S> maximilian emmanuel if we do but discover him , he must believe in the gratitude of the heart ! monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes , and he again walked hastily up and down the room .: 61.19
<S> a propos , said m. de tre ville , calling him back .: 14.51
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> a long pause ensued , which lasted until all the flowers were removed .: 72.94
<S> but d artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of m. bazin ; and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friend s valet , he simply moved him out of the way with one hand , and with the other turned the handle of the door of number five .: 43.43
<S> on arriving at the king s private antechamber , m. de tre ville found la chesnaye , who informed him that they had not been able to find m. de la tre mouille on the preceding evening at his ho tel , that he returned too late to present himself at the louvre , that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king .: 20.42
<S> one could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death .: 54.09
<S> at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean , d artagnan upset a man ; it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on .: 67.56
<S> valentine , repeated the same voice .: 25.14
<S> while walking near the wood of monsieur le prince , i laid a few snares in the runs ; and while reclining on the banks of his highness s pieces of water , i slipped a few lines into his fish ponds .: 64.50
<S> what ? after the varied relations i have had the happiness to sustain towards you , can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing ?: 43.44
<S> i would confide my life to them , but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majesty s. well ! said athos , since you have not a regiment , we are three devoted men .: 58.48
<S> then you were going to rueil ? yes !: 17.86
<S> go . the musketeers set off and d artagnan was left alone with raoul .: 33.65
<S> there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women .: 19.67
<S> in half an hour la ramee returned , full of glee , like most men who have eaten , and more especially drank to their heart s content .: 46.66
<S> felton remained in the corridor .: 21.23
<S> you perceive , then , that he is not happy ? said the count .: 15.14
<S> he had the resolution to stop with this .: 30.83
<S> kitty , said he , i will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like ; don t let that disturb you . and he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a cherry .: 39.49
<S> in heaven s name , my dear athos , do not make a useless sacrifice .: 21.34
<S> still , she felt her pulse , and finding it throb violently she remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink , for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain , and for a short time she suffered less .: 81.33
<S> that has weakened my purse . and i , said aramis , imagined that i had given almost my last sou to the church of montdidier and the jesuits of amiens , with whom i had made engagements which i ought to have kept .: 39.13
<S> know you again ?: 120.99
<S> the moment the little troop passed goskal and were approaching the post , a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness , and advanced into the middle of the road , putting his finger on his lips .: 44.75
<S> oh ! and , more especially , a notorious coward . oh , oh !: 55.64
<S> really ! said d artagnan , abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts , athos , i can not imagine how you can talk to us in that way .: 47.84
<S> the abbe scarron .: 16.95
<S> take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself . then , replied d artagnan , though i shall not have you , athos , at all events i shall have that dear fair haired head by me ; and though he s but a boy , yet , since your soul lives again in him , dear athos , i shall always fancy that you are near me , sustaining and encouraging me . the four friends embraced with tears in their eyes .: 52.60
<S> sinbad started and looked fixedly at him , as he replied , what makes you suppose so ? everything , answered franz , your voice , your look , your pallid complexion , and even the life you lead . i ? i live the happiest life possible , the real life of a pasha .: 67.67
<S> he sat down without saying a word to anybody , and began to reflect .: 16.47
<S> a door opened , through which the attendant and the baron disappeared .: 34.03
<S> all this is perhaps folly perhaps insanity ; but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love ; what queen a servant more ardent ? my lord , my lord , you invoke in your defense things which accuse you more strongly .: 130.18
<S> fernand understood nothing except that dante s was absent .: 37.81
<S> i shall leave you the saucepan , and pour your soup into that .: 42.93
<S> when she was only about three steps from him , he turned his head round , fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion , who had risen and was approaching , followed by her black boy and her woman .: 43.50
<S> how could this rock , which weighed several tons , have been lifted to this spot , without the aid of many men ?: 70.50
<S> tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man .: 145.31
<S> what ! demanded d artagnan .: 10.48
<S> the counsels of his friend , joined to the cries of his own heart , made him determine , now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied , not to see milady again .: 69.53
<S> i was then obliged to come back again .: 19.64
<S> fifty vessels were waiting to set out .: 50.81
<S> under orders from general cromwell .: 133.97
<S> the whole of the second story was set apart for maximilian ; it was precisely similar to his sister s apartments , except that for the breakfast parlor he had a billiard room , where he received his friends .: 56.91
<S> the catacombs of saint sebastian chapter 38 .: 26.36
<S> the interrogatories , preceded by a minute search operated upon the persons arrested , were almost always framed thus : has madame bonacieux sent anything to you for her husband , or any other person ?: 112.81
<S> the morning was beautiful , and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades , like curtains of golden gauze .: 65.88
<S> morrel could not resist this ; he was not exemplary for piety , he was not easily impressed , but valentine suffering , weeping , wringing her hands before him , was more than he could bear in silence .: 45.13
<S> here it is , said he .: 8.53
<S> well , well , said one , the madman has gone to look after his treasure .: 41.59
<S> ah , i know , said she , lowering her voice and going close to the old man .: 17.42
<S> tis true , he said ; but where can i get a chisel to take the planks out , a gimlet to pierce the cask ? trousers , said grimaud , still squaring his accounts .: 65.09
<S> i thought i had been deceived had mistaken the spot .: 35.55
<S> the island was familiar to the crew of la jeune ame lie , it was one of her regular haunts .: 20.17
<S> ah , said monte cristo i did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded . oh , things take their course without our assistance .: 48.31
<S> he is leaving them ! they are beating the rappel ! cried chatillon ; we must discover what is going on . in fact , they saw the soldiers running to their arms ; the trumpets sounded ; the drums beat ; the duc de beaufort drew his sword .: 44.52
<S> comte de la fere ! the man cried out ; chevalier d herblay !: 28.39
<S> this affair does not , then , weigh upon your conscience ? faith , no . and you , d artagnan ? i i own that when my mind returns to that terrible period i have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor madame bonancieux .: 71.49
<S> i am a criminal , as it appears .: 21.26
<S> what s to be done ? what did the cardinal say about me ? i was to take your dispatches , written or verbal , and return by post ; and when he shall know what you have done , he will advise what you have to do . i must , then , remain here ? here , or in the neighborhood . you can not take me with you ? no , the order is imperative .: 33.06
<S> that s a frightful place , that bastille !: 44.33
<S> felton named lord de winter ; the unknown would not name anybody , and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make himself known .: 70.43
<S> i will set before him the example of madame de morcerf and her son . what example ? they gave all their fortune to the hospitals . what fortune ? their own m .: 86.08
<S> you may copy it , give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at www.gutenberg.org .: 8.75
<S> and i say to you : one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow ; one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared , despite many crimes . mr .: 226.11
<S> open the gate , he cried .: 20.15
<S> i shall follow the count s directions . not under present circumstances , monsieur . perhaps you mean to disobey me ? yes , monsieur , i must . you persist , then ? yes , i am going ; may you be happy , monsieur , and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out .: 36.44
<S> at the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript , upon the cover of which was written mirame , a tragedy in five acts , and raised his head .: 41.19
<S> and that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education , to be entered upon the following day .: 70.12
<S> you said that his majesty , king charles , my august consort , had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects ! yes , madame , chatillon stammered out .: 49.62
<S> her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband .: 42.88
<S> i have sent for three of my friends , but who knows whether they were at home ? yes , yes !: 18.90
<S> what do you say ? said louise .: 8.71
<S> will they dare to arrest a man in his majesty s service ? pardieu ! they did not scruple much in the case of athos .: 43.15
<S> in your place i would stake the furniture against the horse . but he will not wish for only one harness . stake both , pardieu ! i am not selfish , as you are . you would do so ? said d artagnan , undecided , so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail , in spite of himself .: 44.06
<S> excellency , returned bertuccio , joining his hands , and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the count s laughter , had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him , and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience .: 40.91
<S> you are always right , said the music teacher , seating herself by the side of her friend .: 30.77
<S> had entertained toward mazarin , and he endeavored to receive the minister s homage with civility .: 77.79
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> what does the animal say ? asked the duke .: 16.63
<S> was born .: 132.64
<S> all that you tell me of those by whom i am surrounded , monsieur d artagnan , is doubtless true , said the queen , but i have confidence in you alone .: 32.73
<S> the king came out first from his room .: 35.13
<S> the steward entered .: 20.08
<S> the count followed them with his eyes , his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth , whose height was almost equal to his own ; but as soon as they were out of sight he said : raoul , we set out to night for paris . eh ? cried the young man , turning pale .: 27.01
<S> the storm increased , the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly , the thunder began to growl , and the wind , the precursor of a hurricane , whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen .: 43.90
<S> this moment come , my lord , said d artagnan .: 12.84
<S> the officer entered , a large fat man , with an open physiognomy .: 41.02
<S> you , who are a perfect being , bid spirit triumph over body .: 176.94
<S> there s luck , my lord !: 22.96
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> we were all so happy in the chateau de pierrefonds ! and without any other complaint , passive and obedient , either from true devotion to his master or from the example set by blaisois , mousqueton leaped into the sea headforemost .: 73.50
<S> yes , he checks his pace ; he stops at the gate ; he rings . milady sprang out of bed .: 66.24
<S> neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina , and also what performers appeared in it .: 69.33
<S> it was a melancholy sight that of these six men , traveling in silence , each plunged in his own thoughts , sad as despair , gloomy as chastisement .: 71.74
<S> this is what had taken place : we have seen that it was not of his own free will , but , on the contrary , very reluctantly , that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner .: 27.41
<S> nevertheless , let not your majesty be uneasy , we will find means . and i have none , either , said the queen .: 37.69
<S> i merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife , and see whether it has not always been consistent .: 54.32
<S> his hands , gracefully placed , one upon his hat , the other in the opening of his white waistcoat , were not at all tremulous ; his eye was calm and even brilliant .: 43.57
<S> this will give a faint idea of the carnival at rome .: 34.75
<S> you are rich then , my dear monsieur bonacieux ? i am comfortably off , monsieur , that s all ; i have scraped together some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the haberdashery business , but more particularly in venturing some funds in the last voyage of the celebrated navigator jean moquet ; so that you understand , monsieur but ! cried the citizen .: 70.62
<S> when the police is at fault , it declares that it is on the track ; and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say , with a sneaking air , that the track is lost . yes , but they have found a corpse ; the general has been killed , and in all countries they call that a murder . a murder do you call it ?: 54.38
<S> the officer waited for his reply , and seeing it so long coming , he burst into a laugh , turned upon his heel , and re entered the house .: 26.13
<S> do not attribute to me more than i deserve , sire , that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me . the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look , and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design ; that is to say , that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king , he had made a friend of one on whom , in case of necessity , he might rely .: 36.11
<S> but tell me , valentine , how has it all been effected ?: 27.46
<S> don t think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage , said he ; oh , no , it s only because i am tired , and also because i have a little business to talk over with you . come , step in , said the young man .: 34.61
<S> i saw him from the window , madame ; he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age , and is called the viscount de bragelonne . the queen , smiling , made a sign with her head ; the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold .: 23.89
<S> let us load the guns . the four musketeers went to work ; and as they were loading the last musket grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready .: 32.79
<S> d artagnan and i .: 26.48
<S> valentine rose to fetch the dictionary .: 31.84
<S> coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of a good housewife .: 80.24
<S> the newly introduced personage followed bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out ; and the moment the door closed , they have seen each other ; said he , approaching the cardinal eagerly .: 66.44
<S> madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo , around the courtyard , over the peristyle , and across the front of the house , then , repressing a slight emotion , which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color , she ascended the steps , saying to morrel : sir , if you were a friend of mine , i should ask you if you would sell your horse . morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace , and then turned round to monte cristo , as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment .: 39.31
<S> athos then arose from his chair , girded on his sword , enveloped himself in his cloak , and left the ho tel .: 18.08
<S> edmond , said she , and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke , how noble it is of you , how great the action you have just performed , how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her , alas , i am grown old with grief more than with years , and can not now remind my edmond by a smile , or by a look , of that merce de s whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating .: 73.09
<S> mon dieu !: 16.61
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> nothing but one word ! said d artagnan .: 12.46
<S> i can never forgive myself ! monsieur , said louis xviii. , i command you to speak . well , sire , the usurper left elba on the 26th february , and landed on the 1st of march . and where ?: 40.07
<S> did not the messenger say your father s safety depended upon it ? but what danger threatens him , then , emmanuel ? she asked .: 48.54
<S> he was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty feet .: 35.28
<S> oh , we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you , answered la carconte , with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took .: 59.59
<S> do you see that ? said the king .: 7.88
<S> few have passed through this revolutionary period , in the midst of which we were born , without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier , or the gown of the magistrate .: 75.58

<S> although it was impossible that valentine should see him , hidden as he was , he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him ; his disturbed mind told him so .: 39.23
<S> cruel enough , if i am guilty ; but what name can you give it , what name will the lord give it , if i am innocent ? i am a soldier , madame , and fulfill the orders i have received . do you believe , then , that at the day of the last judgment god will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges ?: 51.16
<S> there was a moment of frozen silence between these two .: 25.96
<S> yes , i will not deny it , i do await , and i do love him of whom you speak ; and , if he does not return , instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate , i will tell you that he died loving me and me only . the young girl made a gesture of rage .: 30.71
<S> penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his master s daughter mademoiselle julie , and had never been able to change the name to madame herbault .: 39.41
<S> we , too , said athos , to the footman who had given him that answer , not only bring news from england , but have just come from there . what ?: 40.54
<S> ah , pardieu ! is that you ? said porthos to d artagnan .: 12.48
<S> why , it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation .: 28.72
<S> athos immediately profited by the permission , and the door was closed behind him .: 20.66
<S> my dear fellow , i invited them to a dinner the next day , replied aramis .: 22.33
<S> there she must always be ; and to marry mademoiselle danglars would be awful . you are difficult to please , viscount . yes , for i often wish for what is impossible . what is that ? to find such a wife as my father found . monte cristo turned pale , and looked at albert , while playing with some magnificent pistols .: 44.19
<S> tis a long time since i saw thee ! come , come , d artagnan , said athos , do not affect to be strong minded ; there are tears in your eyes .: 24.07
<S> yes , we are severed ; there is the great , the distressing truth !: 52.39
<S> how should i know what horse furniture is ? you should have left it to me , then , madame , who know what they are ; but you wished to be frugal , and consequently to lend at usury . it was wrong , monsieur porthos ; but i will repair that wrong , upon my word of honor . how so ? asked the musketeer .: 36.73
<S> debray had told you ah , yes ; he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation . i was once very fond of it , but i do not indulge now . then you are wrong , madame .: 32.24
<S> from that time he had watched them , and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone , had carried her off , and believed he at length had her in his power , when the ball , directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman , had pierced his heart .: 34.91
<S> monte cristo bowed , and went to madame de villefort .: 8.23
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> that is the reason which has induced you to leave via reggio , where you have lived since the death of your wife .: 37.64
<S> i wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom , but your brother maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now , i am sure . then turning around , and seeing that morrel , still on his knees , had thrown himself into an armchair , he added in a low voice , pressing emmanuel s hand significantly , watch over him . why so ? asked the young man , surprised .: 37.98
<S> what means this ? asked the count .: 12.97

<S> during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions , porthos and aramis , they could remember having often seen him smile , but had never heard him laugh .: 47.60
<S> and a gentleman to hobnob with a bailiff ! porthos , said aramis , athos has already told you that you are a simpleton , and i am quite of his opinion .: 30.40
<S> go on , baptistin . then to admit no one except major bartolomeo cavalcanti and his son . you hear major bartolomeo cavalcanti a man who ranks amongst the most ancient nobility of italy , whose name dante has celebrated in the tenth canto of the inferno , you remember it , do you not ?: 71.70

<S> my friend , said she , how came you here ?: 17.23
<S> i retained my harness by instinct .: 68.11
<S> the next morning , however , just as he removed his bed from the wall , he heard three knocks ; he threw himself on his knees .: 19.38
<S> then walking towards morrel , he took his hand ; the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor .: 34.63

<S> he was profoundly versed in hunting and falconry , and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished even louis xiii .: 124.83

<S> teach bazin prosody ; that will console him .: 145.70
<S> indeed , madame , you believe me too credulous ! confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this personage . i invent nothing , madame ; i create nothing .: 70.52
<S> we have fallen in with a party of spaniards .: 46.35
<S> he shuddered , and rubbed his eyes as though awaking from a dream .: 26.41

<S> one of marie michon s adventures .: 32.27

<S> a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave , and was feeding at a little distance .: 36.53
<S> athos and aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades , who demanded the watchword ; and on their saying that they were going to monsieur de bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them , but in fact as a spy over their movements .: 56.74
<S> the king s authority will put all this to rights . was it to tell me that , madame , coldly replied gondy , that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence ? no , my dear coadjutor , said mazarin ; it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves . is it true , asked gondy , feigning astonishment , that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion ? yes , said the queen , it is requested . the coadjutor bowed .: 37.82
<S> let us see , said he , i have swum above an hour , but as the wind is against me , that has retarded my speed ; however , if i am not mistaken , i must be close to tiboulen .: 32.06
<S> in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new born child .: 85.78
<S> you know noirmont , do you not ?: 19.15
<S> but d artagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that .: 20.09
<S> everyone held the accusing paper , but , as usual , no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack .: 55.11
<S> i have been most anxious to see you , that i might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express . surely so trifling a circumstance can not deserve a place in your remembrance .: 115.39
<S> i make the first advances ? said the king .: 26.78
<S> in all probability , therefore , the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi vampa himself , and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as sinbad the sailor , but who , no doubt , was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome , as he had already done at porto vecchio and tunis .: 42.16
<S> his health hurrah ! but the means the means ? said fernand .: 110.89
<S> the floor of the abbe s cell was paved , and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which dante s had witnessed the completion .: 45.03
<S> one hour s rapid progress , however , sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young man s bright anticipations ; and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedom a pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependence seemed to raoul to gild not only heaven and earth , but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future .: 160.92
<S> noirtier gave his assent .: 61.08
<S> ten men for monsieur de comminges . as the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the quai and overflowed the pont neuf and adjacent streets .: 76.51

<S> come , will you do to day what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for the queen ? i will do everything your majesty commands , replied d artagnan .: 43.18
<S> he can not possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct , not being , as you are , a paid servant , but a mere slave a dog , who , should he fail in his duty towards me , i should not discharge from my service , but kill . baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment .: 72.30
<S> you seem secretly elated . yes , giulio , she said , proud and happy ; for i have found the means of strangling this hydra . you are a great politician , my queen , said mazarin ; let us hear the means . and he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper .: 61.10
<S> are you armed ? he asked .: 13.04
<S> once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown , whom he loved already ; and then his mind was made up when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening , he would kill him with his water jug .: 70.95
<S> come , aramis . and we , porthos , said d artagnan , will return , carrying our shame to the cardinal . and tell him , cried a voice , that i am not too old yet for a man of action . d artagnan recognized the voice of de rochefort .: 27.97
<S> happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to one s self and the walls walls have ears but no tongue ; but if a large fortune produces happiness , danglars is happy . and fernand ? fernand ?: 206.37
<S> aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times .: 33.90
<S> do you remember how he cried , on , d artagnan , on , i am taken ?: 40.50
<S> if he could have made any use of me , he would have taken me with him ; he leaves me in paris , as our separation will conduce to his benefit ; therefore he has gone , and i am free forever , added madame danglars , in the same supplicating tone .: 35.05
<S> come , monsieur , come ! and both set off towards the capital at full gallop .: 29.35
<S> now suppose that next day , one of these eels , or pike , or carp , poisoned at the fourth remove , is served up at your table .: 76.29
<S> the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape , and that she had fainted in one of the paths , was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind .: 41.37
<S> no , sir ; before all who are here . albert s witnesses looked at each other .: 28.33
<S> ah , monseigneur , how dearly have i paid for that fault , unhappy wretch as i am ! that gentleman , i say , what has become of him ? deign to listen to me , monseigneur , and be merciful !: 37.97
<S> you may be overheard . yes , you are right ; i should be ashamed for anyone to know your baseness . but what do you require of me , then ?: 22.71
<S> we must extricate ourselves from this position . but how ? listen !: 50.05
<S> the lions den chapter 108 .: 21.62
<S> but d artagnan , whose ideas had taken quite another course , forgot himself like a fool , and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts .: 65.73
<S> what the truly guilty ? the truly guilty , said milady , is the ravager of england , the persecutor of true believers , the base ravisher of the honor of so many women he who , to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart , is about to make england shed so much blood , who protects the protestants today and will betray them tomorrow buckingham !: 122.79
<S> the two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the mazarinists scattered about the isle of france , and also to escape the frondeurs , who were in possession of normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the duc de longueville , in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes .: 55.56
<S> yes . and you will protect us , who are your children , against the will of my father ? noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel , as if to say , perhaps i may . maximilian understood him .: 37.12
<S> have you kept him in the cellar all this time ? merciful heaven !: 44.03
<S> at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade .: 19.82
<S> to know what ? the name of the owner of the winning horse ? excessively ; only imagine but do tell me , viscount , whether you really are acquainted with it or no ? i beg your pardon , madame , but you were about to relate some story , were you not ?: 51.28
<S> de motteville will not be astonished at this reply .: 43.60
<S> d artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword ; but bernajoux cried out that it was nothing , and rushing blindly upon him , absolutely spitted himself upon d artagnan s sword .: 59.10
<S> by the latter i mean your relatives and friends .: 90.18
<S> never mind where he is , let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends . during this conversation , dante s , after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends , had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him , merely saying , make yourselves quite easy , my good fellows , there is some little mistake to clear up , that s all , depend upon it ; and very likely i may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that . 0075m oh , to be sure ! responded danglars , who had now approached the group , nothing more than a mistake , i feel quite certain . dante s descended the staircase , preceded by the magistrate , and followed by the soldiers .: 52.28
<S> what orders ? asked milady .: 22.98
<S> but you are deceived , edmond , she continued .: 15.42
<S> he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted .: 41.39
<S> i require honorable guaranties . i am , sir , a living guaranty , replied monte cristo , motionless , but with a threatening look ; we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shed that is our mutual guaranty .: 80.24
<S> the jailer continued : now this was his project .: 79.33
<S> since his first arrival at paris , he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man , whom he had always found worthy , loyal , and great .: 66.80
<S> you may reckon upon me and so may your friend . then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile , he re entered his closet more calmly , for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment .: 58.92
<S> he almost believed in the tenderness of milady ; he almost believed in the crime of de wardes .: 43.86
<S> you talk like a noodle , my friend , said caderousse ; and here is danglars , who is a wide awake , clever , deep fellow , who will prove to you that you are wrong .: 32.97
<S> besides , of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch ?: 48.78
<S> besides , the wheels of a carriage , which appeared to have come from paris , had made a deep impression in the soft earth , which did not extend beyond the pavilion , but turned again toward paris .: 44.70
<S> section 1 .: 33.41
<S> he lifted up the drapery over the entrance to edward s room , and his eye reaching as far as madame de villefort s apartment , he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor .: 39.23
<S> last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds .: 99.20
<S> oh , how bitter a fate is mine , to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself , while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse !: 75.48
<S> the queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left , and seeing that it was empty , she said : but where is madame de longueville ? ah , yes , where is my sister ? asked the prince .: 16.22
<S> in that case i can comprehend the length of the conversation . felton started ; and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted puritan .: 27.29
<S> did you know that ? no , monseigneur .: 14.95
<S> on their side , the three musketeers were much attached to their young comrade .: 22.00
<S> you see , said he , calling d artagnan s attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hour s walk , we have made a tour of my domains . all is charming and everything savors of nobility , replied d artagnan .: 30.80
<S> it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact , said athos .: 21.55
<S> am i to accompany you , your excellency ? cried bertuccio .: 18.99
<S> the nails , too , were turning blue .: 87.74
<S> d artagnan then repeated his name , and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past , m. de tre ville grasped the situation .: 31.80
<S> preparations were making on every side ; chairs were placed , scaffolds were raised , and windows were hung with flags .: 105.27
<S> set out immediately for paris , and demand of the count of monte cristo , avenue des champs e lyse es , no .: 25.11
<S> you have , perhaps , no money ? perhaps is too much , said d artagnan , smiling .: 19.83
<S> he produced the ring , his mark of authority , with which ali pasha generally sealed his letters , and which the latter had given him , that he might , on his return at any hour of the day or night , gain access to the presence , even in the harem .: 61.94
<S> a strange , incomprehensible , unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city ; one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets , now dark as ocean s most unfathomable caves .: 150.78
<S> he grew deadly pale , placed his hand upon his heart , which was breaking , and at once perceived all the treachery .: 38.31
<S> it is very fortunate , she observed , that such substances could only be prepared by chemists ; otherwise , all the world would be poisoning each other . by chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry , said monte cristo carelessly .: 47.97
<S> if my vote and interest can obtain it for him , i will readily give him the one and promise the other .: 64.04
<S> you appear to forget yourself sadly . no , sir , said albert , coldly ; there are circumstances in which one can not , except through cowardice , i offer you that refuge , refuse to admit certain persons at least . what is your errand , then , with me , sir ? i mean , said albert , drawing near , and without apparently noticing cavalcanti , who stood with his back towards the fireplace i mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes ; that will be sufficient where two men having met , one of them will remain on the ground . danglars turned pale ; cavalcanti moved a step forward , and albert turned towards him .: 59.77
<S> i had a brother , an elder brother , who was in the service of the emperor ; he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of corsicans .: 41.81
<S> he then inquired how they had fared in their trip .: 54.91
<S> we traveled five or six leagues , serious , silent , and almost without speaking .: 62.13
<S> what hatred she distills !: 286.93
<S> besides , one must lay out one s inheritance somehow . ah , porthos ! cried one of his companions , don t try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity .: 61.87
<S> don t be uneasy on that score , replied villefort ; no ceremony will be neglected in my house .: 30.81
<S> the blood rose to her head , and her little foot worked with impatience beneath her robe .: 48.75
<S> now , asked porthos , what are we to do ? now we shall make use of your shoulder , friend porthos , if this door proves to be locked .: 37.27
<S> yes , he is a terrible antagonist .: 22.92
<S> this duet is one of the most beautiful , expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti .: 77.56
<S> i , he said .: 17.92
<S> add another day for landing , and that would make four .: 81.07
<S> my lord , said d artagnan , monsieur de vallon is like me , he prefers service extraordinary that is to say , enterprises that are considered mad and impossible . that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin ; he fell into meditation .: 60.83
<S> but , said debray to beauchamp , if i spoke to the president , you must have been with the procureur . it was an impossibility ; for the last week m. de villefort has secluded himself .: 34.33
<S> the same night , such a man of regularity was the patron of la jeune ame lie , the profits were divided , and each man had a hundred tuscan livres , or about eighty francs .: 36.77
<S> at one of the doors , that by which he had entered , i placed our scotchman , making a sign to him to follow the man wherever he might go , if he came out again .: 30.59
<S> they arrived at the drinking room of the parpaillot .: 23.21
<S> at the first words of the count de guiche , the prince , having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon , had understood everything .: 35.34
<S> on leaving bazin , friquet started off to the palais royal , where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards ; and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music , he took his place at their head , beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet , which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony .: 52.44
<S> you , also , stand aside , he said to the masked man .: 42.95
<S> he made his way along the corridors through force of habit ; he threw aside his magisterial robe , not out of deference to etiquette , but because it was an unbearable burden , a veritable garb of nessus , insatiate in torture .: 108.55
<S> to lose you my friendship if he were conquered , and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor .: 117.65
<S> no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does , and is , like himself , a dealer in magical arts .: 68.00
<S> when i strove to speak , a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips .: 50.62
<S> la chesnaye , said the king , let someone go instantly and find monsieur de la tre mouille ; i wish to speak with him this evening . your majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between monsieur de la tre mouille and myself ? nobody , by the faith of a gentleman . tomorrow , then , sire ? tomorrow , monsieur . at what o clock , please your majesty ? at any hour you will . but in coming too early i should be afraid of awakening your majesty . awaken me !: 33.37
<S> at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again , and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner , who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself .: 48.50
<S> reports were whispered about , like certain sounds which announce , as they whistle from wave to wave , the coming storm and when they pass athwart a multitude , presage an emeute .: 222.95
<S> do you know that his eminence has been making fresh complaints against your musketeers , and that with so much emotion , that this evening his eminence is indisposed ?: 51.59
<S> thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it , m. de tre ville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword , and was so faithful to his motto , that louis xiii. , one of the good blades of his kingdom , was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight , he would advise him to choose as a second , himself first , and tre ville next or even , perhaps , before himself .: 57.42
<S> are not your name , your social position , and your merit sufficient ? no , said andrea , no ; it is useless for you to say so , count .: 33.25
<S> so you defend him !: 49.15
<S> ah ?: 39.84
<S> a carriage had been sent to meet him , and the gigantic porthos , who stood a head above the entire rabble , soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching .: 58.27
<S> when i am happy , i wish all the world to be so ; but it appears that is not possible . the young man departed , laughing at the joke , which he thought he alone could comprehend .: 28.38
<S> from th abyss he ll give ear to my moan . felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified .: 153.20
<S> it appears that in falling , continued athos , with some hesitation , he broke his thigh . ah , ah ! said the cardinal ; and you , monsieur porthos ? i , monseigneur , knowing that dueling is prohibited i seized a bench , and gave one of those brigands such a blow that i believe his shoulder is broken . very well , said the cardinal ; and you , monsieur aramis ? monseigneur , being of a very mild disposition , and being , likewise , of which monseigneur perhaps is not aware , about to enter into orders , i endeavored to appease my comrades , when one of these wretches gave me a wound with a sword , treacherously , across my left arm .: 56.46
<S> madame danglars therefore came , not only beautiful in person , but radiant with splendor ; she entered by one door at the time when merce de s appeared at the door .: 48.95
<S> how , go then ? exclaimed d artagnan .: 19.31
<S> he awoke .: 25.23
<S> the first advantage had been gained by buckingham .: 35.83
<S> but , said he , did you observe one very singular thing ? what ? how attentively he looked at you . at me ? yes . albert reflected .: 36.29
<S> but be of good courage , my lad ; in three days we shall be delivered from this creature , and where i shall send her she can harm nobody . you hear him ! cried milady , with vehemence , so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven , and that felton might understand she was addressing him .: 53.58
<S> athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described , and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him .: 45.72
<S> i have known you four days ; i have loved him four years .: 32.49
<S> that the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument . are you mad , la ramee ?: 79.26
<S> empty ! he exclaimed ; the infernal demons ! we must pursue them , said groslow , they can t be gone far , and we will sink them , passing over them . yes , but the fire , ejaculated mordaunt ; i have lighted it . ten thousand devils ! cried groslow , rushing to the hatchway ; perhaps there is still time to save us . mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh , threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after it .: 56.78
<S> you follow the world , my young friend , and i tremble lest grace prove not efficacious . be satisfied , my reverend father , i can answer for myself . mundane presumption ! i know myself , father ; my resolution is irrevocable . then you persist in continuing that thesis ? i feel myself called upon to treat that , and no other .: 72.30
<S> go and tell lord de winter that his prisoner has fainted for this event not having been foreseen , i don t know what to do . the soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer .: 39.81
<S> you know the vessel is lost . the pharaon , sir they signal the pharaon !: 101.23
<S> when i live at auteuil , you must come there , as you belong to my service . bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master , and remained motionless , without making any answer .: 28.91

<S> sir , cried morrel , seizing the moist hand of the paralytic , they ask me who i am , and what right i have to be here .: 29.40
<S> at the same time , continued d artagnan , notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year , and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year , it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage , hey ? yes indeed , said porthos .: 25.14

<S> i don t very well know what , but still something . monseigneur , said d artagnan , this was what happened to me never mind , never mind ! resumed the cardinal , with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it .: 30.10
<S> ah ! said d artagnan , who began to understand .: 9.70

<S> on guard ! but , said he whom d artagnan thus provoked , it appears to me that this place is badly chosen , and that we should be better behind the abbey st. germain or in the pre aux clercs . what you say is full of sense , replied d artagnan ; but unfortunately i have very little time to spare , having an appointment at twelve precisely .: 51.03

<S> they had observed for some time before them , on the horizon , a rather thick wood ; and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it , monsieur d arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count s two grooms .: 39.10
<S> by degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon ; but as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology , its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave , as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of amphitrite , who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle .: 49.09
<S> and this room ? he asked , pointing to the captain s cabin .: 24.81

<S> help !: 33.86
<S> the man at the telegraph , said he , must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture . suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves ; the something rose , uttering an exclamation of astonishment , and monte cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old , who was plucking strawberries , which he was placing upon grape leaves .: 125.94

<S> what you would now do amounts to treason . d artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning , and was silent .: 68.14
<S> i doubt it .: 23.73

<S> after all , i am not an unreasonable man .: 27.58
<S> in a court of justice that is called an alibi . d artagnan found his advice prudent .: 63.34
<S> habitually he spoke little and slowly , bowed frequently , laughed without noise , showing his teeth , which were fine and of which , as the rest of his person , he appeared to take great care .: 97.62
<S> exactly . he lives at the end of the yard , on the left , on the third story . 40132m andrea went as she directed him , and on the third floor he found a hare s paw , which , by the hasty ringing of the bell , it was evident he pulled with considerable ill temper .: 49.13
<S> very good , said d artagnan ; and now in what direction did they set out ? that i am forbidden to tell . d artagnan drew from his pocket a paper .: 19.38
<S> the authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt .: 62.81
<S> what design can i have ? why , then , not let me out by the door ? what would be the advantage of waking the porter ? ah , reverend sir , tell me , do you wish me dead ? i wish what god wills . but swear that you will not strike me as i go down . cowardly fool ! what do you intend doing with me ? i ask you what can i do ?: 36.52
<S> noirtier s room was opened , like all the rest .: 18.55
<S> edmond , at the approach of his patron , respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m. morrel , who , forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared , was gayly followed by the guests , beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes .: 72.66
<S> mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean , he came , his horse going at a foot s pace , to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge , reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year , seven men surrounded by empty bottles .: 73.16
<S> although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress , she did at last so decide , which was all d artagnan wished .: 92.73
<S> besides , there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thought in what way was the escape to be effected ?: 65.21
<S> all this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital .: 96.18
<S> do i regret life ?: 81.15
<S> meanwhile , as the little troop drew nearer to lens , the noise of the cannon sounded louder .: 30.73
<S> then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow ; a croak answered this signal .: 124.00
<S> no longer could edmond look into those wide open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death ; no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed .: 98.17
<S> this screaming mob , are they , or are they not , my subjects ?: 84.39
<S> give your orders , and we will execute them . then open the door directly . peppino obeyed .: 34.36
<S> d artagnan had just passed the rue cassette , and already perceived the door of his friend s house , shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it , when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni .: 44.03
<S> five minutes afterward bazin set off on a full trot , urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie , which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip .: 49.57
<S> monsieur , said i , does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne ?: 54.43
<S> d artagnan , i have always loved you as my son ; porthos , we slept six years side by side ; aramis is your brother as well as mine , and aramis has once loved you , as i love you now and as i have ever loved you .: 51.11
<S> at the beginning of this work , his servant , notwithstanding orders to the contrary , came to his room .: 31.87
<S> you are not convinced yet ? i hope at least , that you may be mistaken . shall you see the king again ? perhaps . would you pass in his eyes for a prophet ? prophets of evil are not in favor at the court , father . true , but some day they do them justice ; and supposing a second restoration , you would then pass for a great man . well , what should i say to the king ? say this to him : sire , you are deceived as to the feeling in france , as to the opinions of the towns , and the prejudices of the army ; he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre , who at nevers is styled the usurper , is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons , and emperor at grenoble .: 59.87
<S> yes .: 18.24
<S> planchet was equally seized with admiration , and said no more about going away .: 61.84
<S> villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him .: 29.56
<S> stay a moment , your excellency , said peppino , rising ; you still owe me something . i said they would skin me , thought danglars ; but resolving to resist the extortion , he said , come , how much do i owe you for this fowl ? your excellency has given me a louis on account . a louis on account for a fowl ? certainly ; and your excellency now owes me 4,999 louis . danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke .: 65.76
<S> each word that fell from his companion s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science , as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda , which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth .: 112.12
<S> i beg you to return me that dispatch . d artagnan obeyed , and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact .: 31.90
<S> the inspector kept his word with dante s ; he examined the register , and found the following note concerning him : edmond dante s : violent bonapartist ; took an active part in the return from elba .: 83.74
<S> diable ! resumed aramis , i have little fancy for the sea by day , still less at night ; the sounds of wind and wave , the frightful movements of the vessel ; i confess i prefer the convent of noisy . athos smiled sadly , for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward de winter .: 58.19
<S> if your excellencies will please to be seated , said the man , i will let the count know that you are here . and with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried portie res .: 29.15
<S> that is their mean yet mighty byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated , hanged , and made away with concini ; and if i gave them their way they would assassinate , hang , and make away with me in the same manner , although they have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then .: 127.34
<S> for my part , i declare i want two thousand . four times two makes eight , then said aramis ; it is eight thousand that we want to complete our outfits , toward which , it is true , we have already the saddles . besides , said athos , waiting till d artagnan , who went to thank monsieur de tre ville , had shut the door , besides , there is that beautiful ring which beams from the finger of our friend .: 48.75
<S> you are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this , said porthos .: 39.64
<S> in the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each other s arms .: 41.53
<S> have you seen him since i left him ?: 23.53
<S> besides , it has perhaps been her majesty s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly .: 91.81
<S> as for himself , he declared that he had only need of a little rest , and that when they returned he should be easier .: 27.50
<S> do you , then , know in what manner fernand injured dante s ? inquired the abbe of caderousse .: 39.52
<S> did you send this wine , aramis ? said athos .: 19.80
<S> you are madame s brother , i learn be it so ; but fortunately you are not mine . it might be thought that milady , timid as women are in general , would have interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to prevent the quarrel from going too far ; but on the contrary , she threw herself back in her carriage , and called out coolly to the coachman , go on home ! the pretty soubrette cast an anxious glance at d artagnan , whose good looks seemed to have made an impression on her .: 56.95
<S> i am at the command of the committee , and even claim the honor of being heard .: 24.00
<S> besides , d artagnan passed the evening with me . well , said the cardinal , everybody seems to have passed the evening with you . does your eminence doubt my word ? said tre ville , with a brow flushed with anger .: 26.10
<S> morrel attributed penelon s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire ; it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account ; he was , no doubt , engaged on board some other vessel , and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having , if we may so express ourselves , worn mourning for the pharaon longer .: 83.97
<S> franz looked up they were opposite the rospoli palace .: 62.62
<S> i waited for him until this hour , replied franz .: 25.50
<S> yes ; a passage of st. augustine , upon which we could not agree , said the gascon .: 36.86
<S> i will go with you . and he took his sword and cloak .: 16.10
<S> he was a man of execution , this worthy porthos .: 29.66
<S> gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of paris .: 33.33
<S> gentlemen ! cried the surrounding group .: 48.52
<S> i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself , had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul .: 86.80
<S> oh , were i not a foreigner !: 26.31
<S> oh , i saw the snare , and i answered you would be quite in despair on your return .: 33.96
<S> nevertheless , as we have said , one circumstance reassured her .: 22.60
<S> d artagnan was perplexed .: 18.75
<S> thinking that porthos will be at last a baron , and d artagnan a captain .: 45.50
<S> she is some emissary of the cardinal ; a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head . the devil !: 27.37
<S> meanwhile raoul closely observed the young general , already made so famous by the battles of rocroy , fribourg , and nordlingen .: 97.51
<S> this letter had been conveyed by d artagnan and had arrived in time .: 27.31
<S> the count was erect and triumphant , like the avenging angel !: 67.71
<S> as to planchet , he has certain reasons for not going to court . and what are they ? oh , he doesn t stand well with his eminence . mouston , said porthos , saddle vulcan and bayard . and for myself , monsieur , shall i saddle rustaud ? no , take a more stylish horse , phoebus or superbe ; we are going with some ceremony . ah , said mousqueton , breathing more freely , you are only going , then , to make a visit ? oh !: 49.73
<S> hayde e had taken away ali , and bertuccio remained with noirtier .: 56.91
<S> i raised my head ; i was in utter darkness .: 22.69
<S> i had well concerted my plans , pursued aramis ; the coadjutor gave me sixty men ; twenty guard the walls of the park , twenty the road from rueil to saint germain , twenty are dispersed in the woods .: 70.37
<S> charles was perceived through the door , lying dressed upon his bed , at the head of which parry was seated , reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible .: 52.58
<S> now , sir , i am listening go on . i will come at once to the point .: 17.83
<S> i know you even better now . his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads , carried by the breeze , until lost in the depths of the horizon .: 52.87
<S> and , now , when are we to go ? asked athos .: 18.58
<S> qui vive ? he asked .: 60.85
<S> why , there is nothing improper in our conversation , my dear planchet , and no one could find fault with it . ah , monsieur ! replied planchet , recurring to his besetting idea , that monsieur bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows , and something very unpleasant in the play of his lips . what the devil makes you think of bonacieux ? monsieur , we think of what we can , and not of what we will . because you are a coward , planchet . monsieur , we must not confound prudence with cowardice ; prudence is a virtue . and you are very virtuous , are you not , planchet ? monsieur , is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder ?: 50.04
<S> his natural prudence , however , never forsook him for a single instant .: 31.78
<S> if the window had been open or even ajar , i should think nothing of it ; but , no all was hermetically sealed .: 74.27
<S> still , it must have been many years in use , for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot ; this soot i dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every sunday , and i assure you a better ink can not be desired .: 76.90
<S> but dante s can not remain forever in prison , and one day or other he will leave it , and the day when he comes out , woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration ! oh , i should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me . yes , and merce de s !: 39.22
<S> as it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege , but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating , we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded , to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal .: 47.94
<S> and the other ? asked athos .: 9.24
<S> they were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother of pearl and silver , and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor .: 85.17
<S> mazarin sent us with a letter to general cromwell . but how came you to fall into company with mordaunt , whom i bade you distrust ? asked athos .: 76.75
<S> as long as he was in the city , planchet kept at the respectful distance he had imposed upon himself ; but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark , he drew softly nearer , so that when they entered the bois de boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master .: 58.65
<S> at that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet .: 35.46
<S> there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged ; monte cristo then was in league with his father s enemies .: 47.40
<S> she felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair , and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity .: 77.09
<S> ideology if the count of monte cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of parisian society , he would have appreciated better the significance of the step which m. de villefort had taken .: 38.88
<S> noirtier , seated in his chair , and listening to every sound , was watching the door ; he saw valentine , and his eye brightened .: 30.26
<S> my daughter is only seventeen years old , and your son twenty one .: 34.73
<S> i sold myself for more than i thought i was worth , he added , attempting to smile ; i fetched 2,000 francs . then these 1,000 francs said merce de s , shuddering .: 47.37
<S> leave him to build up the future for you , and i venture to say you will confide it to safe hands . oh , replied the wretched woman , mournfully shaking her head , the prosperity of which you speak , and which , from the bottom of my heart , i pray god in his mercy to grant him , i can never enjoy .: 44.36
<S> it was against his will that athos took these precautions , but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent , that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission , which , received at the foot of the scaffold , could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta .: 63.33
<S> he was desirous of an explosion , because in that case the mine throws forth fire , and fire enlightens .: 97.04
<S> the pardon the next day danglars was again hungry ; certainly the air of that dungeon was very provocative of appetite .: 124.92
<S> i am mad for her ! kitty breathed a second sigh .: 32.20
<S> not before me , behind me . but with what ? asked the duke .: 38.17
<S> d artagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions .: 58.89
<S> why , if my information prove correct , a sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered . can i believe my ears ? cried the marquise .: 57.27
<S> don t be a coward , or i shall cut off your ears .: 26.69
<S> i therefore maintain , in spite of morcerf , that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment , but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which , after all , may be his ordinary mode of existence . perhaps you are right , said morcerf ; meanwhile , who is in the russian ambassador s box ? which box do you mean ? asked the countess .: 63.32
<S> well , if you know them , you know that they are good and free companions .: 25.51
<S> what should i care for either riches or poverty , if my valentine was near me , and i felt certain that no one could deprive me of her ?: 67.68
<S> ah , said he to debray , who had thrown himself into an easy chair at the farthest extremity of the salon , and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left , what are you doing there ?: 29.90
<S> is he not peculiar ? he is more than that , replied cha teau renaud ; he is one of the most extraordinary men i ever saw in my life .: 19.36
<S> return to camp and you shall know . rochefort remained for a moment in thought ; then , as they were only a day s journey from surge res , whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king , he resolved to follow the advice of athos and go with them .: 39.86
<S> milady sprang out of bed and opened the window .: 16.20
<S> tis a rondeau by monsieur voiture that monsieur l abbe is repeating to me . said athos in a loud voice , and i confess i think it incomparable . raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round madame de chevreuse .: 66.58
<S> there is nothing to do but to send monsieur mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that , nor any other entrance into france . one instant , sir , said the man in a gown , whom he addressed ; a plague on t !: 55.28
<S> of all the exploits performed since their arrival in england by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated , this seemed without question to be the most wonderful .: 74.55
<S> athos cast a glance over the epistle , and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created , read aloud : my cousin , my sister and i are skillful in interpreting dreams , and even entertain great fear of them ; but of yours it may be said , i hope , every dream is an illusion .: 59.07
<S> what ! said he , you have just lost one woman , whom you call good , charming , perfect ; and here you are , running headlong after another . d artagnan felt the truth of this reproach .: 43.45
<S> m. albert would not do us the honor to be jealous ; he does not like euge nie sufficiently .: 47.81
<S> during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed , madame de villefort had gone to visit m. noirtier .: 28.05
<S> bonacieux , shuddering .: 27.52
<S> he sees no one but the king .: 27.67
<S> we must go , said the superb lord of bracieux , lest they should say we were afraid .: 63.77
<S> go on , signor pastrini , continued franz , smiling at his friend s susceptibility .: 14.90
<S> this supposition appeared to her most reasonable .: 52.49
<S> she required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into order .: 63.76
<S> as monsieur porthos is a very boastful man , he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess , whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his adventure . it is a wound that confines him to his bed ? ah , and a master stroke , too , i assure you .: 57.17
<S> now , who was that someone ?: 60.88
<S> on the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on his throne , it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own subjects . to the point , sir , said the queen , to the point , and answer me , yes or no ; if the king persists in remaining in england will you send him succor ?: 59.62
<S> often he was driven away , oftener still had he a dread of being sent away .: 121.51
<S> dante s , though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take , had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him .: 115.40
<S> beware , sir , replied the president , you are no longer in the assembly , and have only to do with individuals ; do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible . but instead of listening , m. d e pinay went on , you are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one . the president stopped the coach .: 50.19
<S> before this day closes , if m. danglars is guilty , he shall cease to live , or i shall die .: 51.11
<S> i point one of the poniards at la ramee s breast and i say to him , my friend , i am sorry for it , but if thou stirrest , if thou utterest one cry , thou art a dead man ! the duke , in pronouncing these words , suited , as we have said , the action to the words .: 40.03
<S> one of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of romance .: 97.63
<S> the nasturtiums and other plants , which his father had delighted to train before his window , had all disappeared from the upper part of the house .: 57.52
<S> mademoiselle de villefort , my step daughter , said madame de villefort to monte cristo , leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards valentine with her hand .: 23.49
<S> does not his appearance speak for him ?: 51.26
<S> did he send you ? yes , sir ; he sent for me to his house , gave me money for my journey , procured a horse , and made me promise not to stop till i had reached you , i have come in fifteen hours . albert opened the letter with fear , uttered a shriek on reading the first line , and seized the paper .: 43.04
<S> i have distrusted god ; i could the more easily distrust you .: 57.78
<S> when their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom , a messenger is sent to negotiate ; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger ; should the ransom be refused , the prisoner is irrevocably lost .: 77.79
<S> they will treat you as a deserter , i warn you . i do not enter the church ; i re enter it .: 37.09
<S> understanding he had nothing more to fear from him , caderousse began to go down .: 46.31
<S> speak . madame , said the cardinal , affecting an effusive frankness of speech , i shall convince your majesty , i trust , of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart .: 36.15
<S> if the lemonade be pure and inoffensive , the syrup will retain its color ; if , on the contrary , the lemonade be drugged with poison , the syrup will become green .: 60.90
<S> well , my dear friend , win it it is at the point of your sword .: 19.50
<S> bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young man .: 13.16
<S> he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head , whilst the musketeer got off the box .: 33.25
<S> he described the death of the other soldier , and the perils they had encountered .: 48.92
<S> it was almost a triumphal procession ; only , behind the guards the barricades were closed again .: 71.66
<S> his own youth seemed to reappear , bringing with it all those savoury remembrances , which are like perfumes more than thoughts .: 111.25
<S> you confess it ! exclaimed mazarin .: 24.00
<S> i am afraid he has turned out ill , she added .: 32.77
<S> then , suddenly pausing , he added , your pardon , sire , but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget , not the respect i have , for that is too deeply engraved in my heart , but the rules of etiquette . go on , go on , sir , replied the king ; you have today earned the right to make inquiries here . sire , interposed the minister of police , i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head , when your majesty s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf , and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty . on the contrary , sir , on the contrary , said louis xviii. , this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention , and the death of general quesnel will , perhaps , put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy . at the name of general quesnel , villefort trembled .: 42.23
<S> the challenge then , continued beauchamp , i took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen .: 42.60
<S> richelieu and now , said athos , resuming his cloak and putting on his hat , now that i have drawn your teeth , viper , bite if you can . and he left the chamber without once looking behind him .: 59.90
<S> to arms ! cried grimaud .: 26.05
<S> to what end ?: 72.85
<S> what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of france in the terrible events which had occurred in england , which they thought should have arrested the attention of all europe .: 54.64
<S> call the viscount and take the musket with you . blaisois was the tall youth , half groom , half peasant , whom we saw at the chateau de bragelonne , whom athos had christened by the name of his province .: 46.40
<S> some of the apartments were closed within and without ; the shutters were only opened to admit a minute s air , showing the scared face of a footman , and immediately afterwards the window would be closed , like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre , and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice , will there be another funeral today at the procureur s house ? madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion ; descending from the cab , she approached the door with trembling knees , and rang the bell .: 60.68
<S> unfortunately he was an honorable man ; he married her .: 39.41
<S> with a little more heart , he might have been contented with this new conquest ; but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride .: 55.25
<S> when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard , of which the lock was difficult , the person was pricked by this small point , and died next day .: 63.52
<S> her pose , which i must admit was rather free , wounded this officer .: 209.36
<S> thus , we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .: 26.64
<S> in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousse s letter .: 50.50
<S> d artagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled curses .: 140.96
<S> tell him also what you have just told me that mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make me a visit , and assure him that i shall take advantage of this honor he proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our captivity . which can not last , interrupted comminges ; the cardinal said so ; there is no prison here . but there are oubliettes ! replied athos , smiling .: 48.00
<S> i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions , and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity .: 100.98
<S> at the moment of arriving at st. paul the spot where such as were condemned at the bastille were executed he was near fainting and crossed himself twice .: 59.81
<S> you really vilify me ! cried olivain .: 27.55
<S> the pavilion at nine o clock d artagnan was at the ho tel des gardes ; he found planchet all ready .: 19.31
<S> you see i am dying ! d artagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in both his own , and hastened to her .: 42.57
<S> the crime was depicted in the most vivid colors ; the former life of the prisoner , his transformation , a review of his life from the earliest period , were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that of the procureur .: 50.31
<S> well , in that case , we can manage famously , said d artagnan ; which of the two horses will you ride that which you bought or the one that was given to you ? that which was given to me , assuredly .: 44.21
<S> what is it , grimaud ?: 15.50
<S> the people , kept back by louvieres , had not made another step forward ; but the awful murmuring , which indicates an angry people , continued .: 100.92
<S> she would have questioned him as he passed by her , but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation , and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed : oh , mademoiselle , mademoiselle , what a dreadful misfortune !: 44.76
<S> a single word had reminded her that morrel was expecting her in m. noirtier s room .: 34.51
<S> depart then , depart , i implore you ! oh , how beautiful you are thus !: 35.71
<S> but how to die ?: 46.82
<S> oh , how i love you ! said buckingham .: 15.24
<S> the trap once replaced over his head , you being on the trap , dead or alive , they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped .: 53.03
<S> he even opened his mouth to tell milady who he was , and with what a revengeful purpose he had come ; but she added , poor angel , whom that monster of a gascon barely failed to kill . the monster was himself .: 80.01
<S> he sprang into his saddle ; the lackey took his place by the coachman ; the carriage went off at a quick pace , escorted by the three horsemen , and all was over .: 23.70
<S> viscount , said athos to raoul , as he entered , you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him . oh !: 46.04
<S> he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice .: 85.15
<S> display is not becoming to everyone , m. de morcerf . at this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene .: 59.10
<S> why did you not accept it ? because i am not willing to die ! cried milady , struggling .: 18.82
<S> the sermon over , the procurator s wife advanced toward the holy font .: 55.11
<S> with his white , aristocratic hands he played with the louis , bending and straightening them again , as if they were made of pewter .: 86.81
<S> look at his uniform , monsieur commissary , look at his uniform ! that s true , murmured the commissary ; pardieu , that s true . at this moment the door was opened quickly , and a messenger , introduced by one of the gatekeepers of the bastille , gave a letter to the commissary .: 26.00
<S> you are poor , are you not ? then he added to himself : these english revolutionists are all beggars and ill bred . my lord , i ought to have a fortune of six millions , but it has been taken from me . you are not , then , a man of the people ? said mazarin , astonished .: 25.51
<S> tell him all this for me , for these are things which a king can not say for himself . thanks , sire , thanks , said the duke ; but your majesty may be assured that it is not those i do not speak of monsieur de tre ville whom your majesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to you . ah !: 31.66
<S> is that monte cristo ? asked the traveller , to whose orders the yacht was for the time submitted , in a melancholy voice .: 41.41
<S> i have always found them ; and more , i repeat it with joy , with triumph , i have always found some proof of human perversity or error .: 57.16
<S> let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal , and how he likes ; but the queen is sacred , and if anyone speaks of her , let it be respectfully . porthos , you are as vain as narcissus ; i plainly tell you so , replied aramis .: 50.93
<S> what s that ? the lightning , answered the captain , our felucca . so far , so good , laughed athos .: 56.70
<S> raoul motioned to the host to approach , threw a crown upon the table , mounted his horse , and posted his letter at senlis .: 42.49
<S> and then must not all be over ?: 87.03
<S> immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire .: 66.12
<S> but how is it he is not already returned ?: 27.20
<S> this began to be annoying .: 55.08
<S> he was never seen at the theatres , at concerts , or in any place of public resort .: 43.01
<S> it was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell , for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility .: 103.15
<S> he commanded a retreat , which began , step by step , foot by foot ; unhappily , in an instant he fell , mortally wounded .: 110.68
<S> now , the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes ; and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean . he went to find aramis .: 80.67
<S> the sight of marks renewed edmond fondest hopes .: 140.90
<S> well , said franz to him ; there is the beginning of an adventure . laugh if you please i really think so .: 41.58
<S> an intervening elevation of land hid the light .: 165.73
<S> le on d armilly , twenty years of age ; profession , artist ; hair black , eyes black ; travelling with his sister . capital !: 146.24
<S> oh , i see you prefer peregrination .: 48.89
<S> why , did not the countess , the proud merce de s , the disdainful catalane , who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances , take your arm , lead you into the garden , into the private walks , and remain there for half an hour ? ah , baron , baron , said albert , you are not listening what barbarism in a megalomaniac like you ! oh , don t worry about me , sir mocker , said danglars ; then turning to monte cristo he said : but will you undertake to speak to the father ? willingly , if you wish it . but let it be done explicitly and positively .: 47.73
<S> the horses started on a trot and took the road to the louvre , which they entered .: 20.45
<S> come , he said , if i pay you the 100,000 francs , will you be satisfied , and allow me to eat at my ease ? certainly , said peppino .: 15.88
<S> they brought me that book .: 74.22
<S> aramis and d artagnan whispered to each other .: 18.64
<S> during this time mazarin walked up and down the study , glancing from time to time at his beautiful venetian mirror , starred in every direction .: 48.10
<S> you do not understand me , gentlemen , said d artagnan , throwing up his head , the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun .: 21.16
<S> by that plain arrangement of the hair , by that costume of extreme simplicity , by the brow polished like marble and as hard and impenetrable , she recognized one of those gloomy puritans she had so often met , not only in the court of king james , but in that of the king of france , where , in spite of the remembrance of the st. bartholomew , they sometimes came to seek refuge .: 64.25
<S> lord de winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him ; and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal , we shall not be compromised .: 28.89
<S> this morning i ventured to run along the gutters and well , interrupted d artagnan , i am delighted that de rochefort is free , but as for thee , if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the king s servants they will hang thee without mercy .: 53.62
<S> yesterday i undertook to employ that cord which you see hanging against the wall , but pain prevented my continuing the pious exercise . that s the first time i ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot wounds with cat o nine tails ; but you were ill , and illness renders the head weak , therefore you may be excused . when do you mean to set out ? tomorrow at daybreak .: 177.98
<S> but whom are you seeking , debray ? i am seeking the count of monte cristo said the young man .: 21.42
<S> in italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count . you have , doubtless , heard the adventures of m. zaccone s youth ? the father s ? no , the son s. i know nothing certain ; at that period of his life , i lost sight of my young comrade . was he in the wars ? i think he entered the service . in what branch ? in the navy . are you not his confessor ? no , sir ; i believe he is a lutheran . a lutheran ? i say , i believe such is the case , i do not affirm it ; besides , liberty of conscience is established in france . doubtless , and we are not now inquiring into his creed , but his actions ; in the name of the prefect of police , i ask you what you know of him .: 49.01
<S> athos alone smiled , with a self possessed , disdainful smile .: 66.10
<S> franz adjusted his telescope , and directed it towards the yacht .: 58.52
<S> the cemetery of the cha teau d if chapter 21 .: 9.88
<S> morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks , apparently awaiting a sign from them to advance , and pointed him out to valentine .: 58.31
<S> at this instant the three friends turned , in spite of themselves , a last look on the rock , upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still .: 64.36
<S> this itinerary possessed another great advantage , that of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrini s story , in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up .: 82.14
<S> as you said , we have acquired glory , and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance . which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us , for , with the help of god , we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists . that evening d artagnan went to present his respects to m. dessessart , and inform him of his promotion .: 65.17
<S> he repaired , then , instantly to the office of the lieutenant criminel .: 41.07
<S> but d artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age , dressed simply , but in perfect taste , entered the room , raising , as he came , his hat , adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers .: 58.64
<S> ah , i am an unfortunate king , monsieur de tre ville !: 14.85
<S> i am a frondist from my heart .: 20.84
<S> about two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe ; but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o clock .: 69.26
<S> upon that , athos yielded .: 61.69
<S> the carriage rolled rapidly onward .: 32.68
<S> at the end of an hour , he heard a faint noise , which increased .: 12.00
<S> porthos placed his hand on the pistols .: 15.21
<S> let us unfold them first , and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his eminence than the others .: 90.78
<S> i have killed your chief , cucumetto , whose dress i now wear ; and i set fire to the villa san felice to procure a wedding dress for my betrothed . an hour afterwards luigi vampa was chosen captain , vice cucumetto , deceased . 20129m well , my dear albert , said franz , turning towards his friend ; what think you of citizen luigi vampa ? i say he is a myth , replied albert , and never had an existence . and what may a myth be ? inquired pastrini .: 66.20
<S> woe is me ! cried the lieutenant ; there s only one man in the world who could stay my hand ; by a fatality that very man bars my way .: 94.97
<S> m. de morcerf is sometimes occupied , his business makes him reflective , and he might , without intending it nothing could be in better taste than my father s demeanor , madame , said albert ; nay , more , he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years .: 91.46
<S> it appears , she resumed , that he sold it he sold it in order to save me another time to be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his danger he sold it to monsieur des essarts , on whose finger i remarked it .: 38.33
<S> come in , tre ville . the duke saluted and retired .: 27.79
<S> if bonaparte landed at naples , the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach piombino ; if he land in tuscany , he will be in an unfriendly territory ; if he land in france , it must be with a handful of men , and the result of that is easily foretold , execrated as he is by the population .: 76.18
<S> aramis related what had been agreed upon .: 53.43
<S> accordingly , d artagnan , on awaking , found his breakfast waiting for him .: 29.85
<S> good morning , my dear host , cried d artagnan .: 11.73
<S> what do you want with me , my friend ? said aramis , with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church .: 24.75
<S> you do not believe me , m. danglars ! i can not help doubting , answered danglars with his stupid smile .: 30.17
<S> have i travelled in that country ?: 45.33
<S> do you think of him ? yes , madame , often and often , but pazienza , as we say in italy ; next , after monsieur de conde , comes the duke of orleans . what are you saying ?: 33.13
<S> dandre is not a man to be accused of treason !: 46.12
<S> they are fed on thyme only , your hares . and how do you like my wine ? asked porthos ; it is pleasant , isn t it ? capital ! it is nothing , however , but a wine of the country . really ? yes , a small declivity to the south , yonder on my hill , gives me twenty hogsheads . quite a vineyard , hey ? porthos sighed for the fifth time d artagnan had counted his sighs .: 58.54
<S> he crossed the court , ran up the two flights to athos s apartment , and knocked at the door enough to break it down .: 36.78
<S> the four countenances expressed four different feelings : that of porthos , tranquillity ; that of d artagnan , hope ; that of aramis , uneasiness ; that of athos , carelessness .: 117.12
<S> why does not he go about his business ? stupid fellow yourself ! said d artagnan , stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse , and answering on his side through the carriage window .: 38.18
<S> no , it does not concern me .: 8.60
<S> he was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real .: 68.48
<S> descend , my lord , said the man in the moat .: 20.38
<S> you owe me nothing but some trifle of 20,000 francs , which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses , so that there is not much of a score between us ; but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate , and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take . upon my word , said albert , i deserve no credit for what i could not help , namely , a determination to take everything as i found it , and to let those bandits see , that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world , there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself .: 88.85
<S> under pretense that he s a king it appears he can not dress or undress without assistance . really , captain , said d artagnan , determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced , the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french .: 72.34
<S> he struck thrice .: 38.30
<S> so that now , continued caderousse , he owns a magnificent house no .: 72.38
<S> he arrived at his usual hour , with a proud look and insolent demeanor ; he alighted , passed through the corridors , and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door keepers or the coolness of his colleagues .: 41.81
<S> shall i speak to him ?: 17.94
<S> she turned upon him , no longer like a furious woman , but like a wounded panther .: 42.57
<S> there he told the chief all his affection for the prisoner , their promises of mutual fidelity , and how every night , since he had been near , they had met in some neighboring ruins .: 59.40
<S> were consumed or nearly so he commenced complaints which athos thought nauseous , porthos indecent , and aramis ridiculous .: 276.31
<S> examine the past and the present , and endeavor to dive into futurity , and then say whether i am not a divine instrument .: 53.44
<S> without uttering a word , they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion .: 71.26
<S> if succor be sent to me , i will accept it . ah , madame , said monte cristo , you should not talk thus !: 26.06
<S> what blows , what blood ! he fainted .: 116.26
<S> there is the prince de conde the hero of rocroy .: 31.75
<S> i must divert my attention ! amuse yourself with milady , my dear d artagnan ; i wish you may with all my heart , if that will amuse you . hear me , athos , said d artagnan .: 32.37
<S> nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner .: 106.67
<S> adieu , my noble and generous friend , adieu ; i will go and tell valentine what you have done for me . and slowly , though without any hesitation , only waiting to press the count s hand fervently , he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by monte cristo .: 49.43
<S> what is it ? asked the baroness .: 5.31
<S> and now , said milady , without appearing to remark the change of the duke s tone toward her now that i have received the instructions of your eminence as concerns your enemies , monseigneur will permit me to say a few words to him of mine ? have you enemies , then ? asked richelieu .: 39.99
<S> you must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me .: 70.15
<S> so soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her eyes .: 32.46
<S> my father howled aloud , plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made , and tore up one of the planks entire .: 83.97
<S> who are you , madame ? said the count to the veiled woman .: 19.97
<S> he did not look like an executioner . and who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office ? but , said mordaunt , it might have been some personal enemy of the king , who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way .: 51.57
<S> it was in this pavilion , on the ground floor , that d artagnan and porthos were confined , suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each different temperament .: 51.92
<S> see paragraph 1.c below .: 25.68
<S> he could not see it , but he felt its presence .: 20.61
<S> but will you not go up ? pass on before me , i beg of you . as the late cardinal used to say to the late king , only to show you the way , sire . and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant .: 45.52
<S> never , till then , had i placed any confidence in presentiments , but now i can not help believing them , valentine .: 58.56
<S> but in returning thither last night , when fortunately you did not accompany him , as his carriage was crossing the rue de la ferronnerie his guards insulted the people , who began to abuse them .: 79.21
<S> if they do not bring us peace , we will give them war ; if they do not bring life , we will give them death . and he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of dionysus of old crete.16 but i , being only a little child , was terrified by this undaunted courage , which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless , and i recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us .: 95.25
<S> gentlemen , i will see the king this evening ; but as to you , i do not advise you to risk doing so . this advice was too reasonable , and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well , to allow the four young men to dispute it .: 34.59
<S> is it you , baron ? said he .: 8.71
<S> the young king would , perhaps , show us some gratitude ; but the queen would never forgive us , and it is she whom we have to consider .: 52.17
<S> i kiss your hands .: 40.41
<S> i told you so , athos , said d artagnan , shrugging his shoulders .: 8.34
<S> athos rose , and offering him his hand , be welcome , my lord , said he , you are one of us . i set out five hours after her from portsmouth , said lord de winter .: 23.53
<S> and now , gentlemen , he continued , turning towards m. de blacas and the minister of police , i have no further occasion for you , and you may retire ; what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war . fortunately , sire , said m. de blacas , we can rely on the army ; your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment . do not mention reports , duke , to me , for i know now what confidence to place in them .: 43.52
<S> the servant then approached athos and said , hesitatingly : monsieur le vicomte has no sword . tis well , said athos , i will take care of that . they went downstairs , raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand , but athos was silent .: 43.21
<S> the jailer was right ; dante s wanted but little of being utterly mad .: 71.63
<S> now , i repeat , beauchamp , i wish to return to human and material existence , and if you are still the friend you profess to be , help me to discover the hand that struck the blow . be it so , said beauchamp ; if you must have me descend to earth , i submit ; and if you will seek your enemy , i will assist you , and i will engage to find him , my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours . well , then , you understand , beauchamp , that we begin our search immediately .: 41.95
<S> la ramee sent away the guards , desiring them to drink to the duke s health , and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors , put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified : whenever my lord pleases . the prince looked at grimaud , grimaud looked at the clock ; it was hardly a quarter past six .: 33.48
<S> and your servants , too , how very well behaved they are ; there is quite a style about them .: 50.39
<S> then an idea crossed my mind , which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box , two feet long , and six or eight inches deep .: 81.61
<S> i will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword between this and calais .: 87.69
<S> project gutenberg is a registered trademark .: 9.94
<S> it is fortunate for you , although your name is bernajoux , to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer .: 55.02
<S> if it be to avenge her , i am ready to follow you . athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis to go and fetch the superior .: 39.04
<S> i entreat you continued villefort .: 32.90
<S> yes , that may be .: 21.86
<S> ah , my friend ! cried the duke , you are so good ; if i could but do as you do , and eat pates and drink burgundy at the house of father marteau s successor . tis true , my lord , answered la ramee , that his pates are famous and his wine magnificent . in any case , said the duke , his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of monsieur de chavigny . well , my lord , said la ramee , falling into the trap , what is there to prevent your trying them ?: 33.43
<S> a change of ideas presented themselves to his brain , like a new design on the kaleidoscope .: 49.51
<S> at length he interrogates me ! said milady to herself , at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result .: 65.98
<S> yes , replied she , trying to recover her self possession .: 21.91
<S> the letter is here . and the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom .: 20.05
<S> on the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air .: 34.19
<S> myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires . to this athos replied quietly : we also have money left for i have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond , and porthos and aramis have not eaten all theirs .: 94.61
<S> on the eve of battle .: 12.28
<S> look , said he to the procureur , whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard , here is in this cup some syrup of violets , and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which m. noirtier and barrois partook .: 58.45
<S> i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively ; that it seems as if i had always known you , and always hated you ; and , in short , since the young people of the present day will not fight , it remains for us to do so .: 33.81
<S> then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle danglars voice , and on his regret , after what he had just heard , that he had been unable to be present the previous evening .: 31.04
<S> war between england and france was talked of as near and certain , and the jolly sailors were having a carousal .: 138.66
<S> the ribbons which held them have been cut with scissors . if my lord suspects they have been stolen , perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his hands . wait , wait ! said the duke .: 65.63
<S> this famous invention of yours ? must i tell you , replied the duke , on what i most reckon and what i determine to try first ? yes , that s the thing , my lord ! cried his custodian , gaily .: 48.80
<S> he turned towards the sailor , who , during this dialogue , had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office , and asked him how these men had landed , as no vessel of any kind was visible .: 47.39
<S> wait a minute longer , and i will introduce him to you . there followed between these two personages a strange silence , during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching .: 36.21
<S> yes , continued the young man ; all is now explained ; with this key i open the abyss .: 45.06
<S> speak , sir , and pray begin at the beginning ; i like order in everything . sire , said villefort , i will render a faithful report to your majesty , but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language . a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium , assured villefort of the benignity of his august auditor , and he went on : sire , i have come as rapidly to paris as possible , to inform your majesty that i have discovered , in the exercise of my duties , not a commonplace and insignificant plot , such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army , but an actual conspiracy a storm which menaces no less than your majesty s throne .: 76.11
<S> bonacieux the second time , as he had carried her off the first .: 35.04
<S> diavolo ! he exclaimed , i forgot the recommendation of de comminges , who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door , in order not to put myself at the mercy of that four headed combination of devils . and with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his steps .: 43.43
<S> monte cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity .: 15.96
<S> you mean to say , then , my dear monsieur la ramee that unless monsieur de beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird , i will continue answerable for him . take care !: 39.76
<S> general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg electronic works 1.a .: 19.61
<S> be christians !: 90.14
<S> six days !: 53.40
<S> he took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable , where he saw a little straw , but in doing so he struck his foot against a human body , which uttered a cry and arose on its knees , rubbing its eyes .: 57.61
<S> he had noticed , however , that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor ; no matter , this was a greater reason for proceeding if his neighbor would not come to him , he would go to his neighbor .: 38.60
<S> in truth , i was fated , said she .: 18.42
<S> then they returned to the rospoli palace ; but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared ; the two windows , hung with yellow damask , were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited .: 31.41
<S> this man uvre was incomprehensible to dante s .: 17.75
<S> matrimonial projects chapter 67 .: 148.20
<S> that letter is not lost ! cried he .: 25.51
<S> grimaud smiled .: 17.69
<S> franz was the excellency , the vehicle was the carriage , and the ho tel de londres was the palace . the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase .: 59.07
<S> is it against you or against myself ?: 82.79
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> he was told that twenty citizens , headed by one man , had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal s bodyguard ; but a reinforcement having come up , the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings ; the house was now being searched .: 58.19
<S> my faith , said aramis , i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians . he is a bad priest , said porthos , who has pity for heretics . in truth , said athos , aramis is right .: 35.32
<S> in paris ? yes . athos and aramis looked at each other .: 11.64
<S> this introduction to milady clarik occupied the head of our gascon greatly .: 143.15
<S> should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law , but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession , a steel probe to search hearts , a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy ? sir , said villefort , upon my word , you overcome me .: 113.07
<S> but what shall you do with him ? with whom ? with albert . what shall i do with albert ?: 28.78
<S> i have reflected , and i can not , must not be guilty of such a sin . ah , you have reflected ! said the prisoner , sitting down in her armchair , with a smile of disdain ; and i also have reflected . upon what ? that i can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word . oh , my god ! murmured felton .: 24.09
<S> indeed , indeed , maximilian , i am very miserable , and if you love me it must be out of pity . valentine , replied the young man , deeply affected , i will not say you are all i love in the world , for i dearly prize my sister and brother in law ; but my affection for them is calm and tranquil , in no manner resembling what i feel for you .: 33.49
<S> your majesty has none but submissive and respectful subjects .: 49.43
<S> and all present , even including cavalcanti and his son , notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other , were thoughtful , on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man .: 61.58
<S> sir , said athos , turning to comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt , here is my sword ; have the kindness to keep it safely for me until i quit my prison .: 45.08
<S> very well , sir , said comminges , you shall hear of this anon . and you of me , sir , said louvieres ; and we shall see then who can speak the loudest . friquet and nanette continued to shout ; the cries , the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects .: 57.20
<S> this illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjects fallen from her high estate . indeed ! well , my lord , four men resolved to save her .: 62.42
<S> raoul , on foot , for he had not time to mount his horse again , tired , like the guards , of distributing blows with the flat of his sword , had recourse to its point .: 51.56
<S> planchet stopped short , staring at d artagnan .: 37.65
<S> the concierge who attended him had only been there since 1830 .: 106.75
<S> ? no , louis xviii . the brother of louis xvi . !: 99.03
<S> tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt urban grandier , though . my friend , urban grandier wasn t a sorcerer , he was a learned man .: 90.62
<S> on the altar , and beneath the portrait , was the casket containing the diamond studs .: 52.48
<S> yet , stammered dante s , wiping the perspiration from his brow , yet i gave you two hundred francs when i left , three months ago . yes , yes , edmond , that is true , but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor , caderousse .: 34.18
<S> the valet led felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from la rochelle , headed by the prince de soubise , and introduced him into a closet where buckingham , just out of the bath , was finishing his toilet , upon which , as at all times , he bestowed extraordinary attention .: 63.72
<S> then he has not returned ? said the duke .: 20.85
<S> she ran therefore to debray , who , after having , like the rest of paris , witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it , had retired in haste to his club , where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the world .: 66.00
<S> as for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual , for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the cafe de paris , venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected , they collected in groups in the hall , in the kitchens , or in their rooms , thinking very little of their duty , which was thus naturally interrupted .: 91.73
<S> shot , my dear boy ?: 89.98
<S> the latter a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty two years , active and lively , the true soubrette of a great lady jumped from the step upon which , according to the custom of the time , she was seated , and took her way toward the terrace upon which d artagnan had perceived lubin .: 51.29
<S> go and fetch a physician ? said she .: 27.01
<S> a young priest , with a simple and trustful heart , performed the duties of the church of that convent .: 42.19
<S> morcerf and cha teau renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission .: 52.47
<S> it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown up daughter ; it seems to make one feverish , and to raise one s pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done . but m. d e pinay , unlike you , bears his misfortune patiently . still more , he talks seriously about the matter , puts on a white tie , and speaks of his family .: 100.55
<S> wait , said valentine ; and , turning to her grandfather , she repeated , wa we wi the old man stopped her at the last syllable .: 41.21
<S> he must now get his bearings .: 64.82
<S> gracious heaven , we are hesitating ! cried d artagnan ; if we hesitate what will the servants do ? i do not hesitate , you know , said grimaud .: 33.55
<S> i will take the whole world as a witness of your crime , and that until i have found an avenger . you are a prostitute , said he , in a voice of thunder , and you shall undergo the punishment of prostitutes !: 36.78
<S> monsieur d artagnan made a compact with you ; and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife , and has placed her beyond reach . m .: 81.76
<S> the bars were filled with drinkers .: 36.61
<S> now then , said andrea , while dressing himself , i ll wait till he leaves , and then i ll slip away . 50047m and , saying this , andrea , who had now put on his boots and cravat , stole gently to the window , and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain .: 46.68
<S> my god !: 11.06
<S> a terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent ; but by degrees carlini s features relaxed , his hand , which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt , fell to his side .: 44.87
<S> but come , i am waiting for you . both men entered monte cristo s carriage , which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at no .: 41.46
<S> yes , that is my name . you said , then , by the word of bonacieux .: 16.50
<S> that you inherit from your mother . truly , from my mother , leonora corsinari . how much may it amount to ? indeed , sir , said andrea , i assure you i have never given the subject a thought , but i suppose it must have been at least two millions . danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure , or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up .: 75.18
<S> then , when we asked them what were their intentions , the master replied that he had forty charges to fire , and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar .: 65.32
<S> d artagnan seemed iron .: 69.71
<S> halloo !: 28.51
<S> as the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detachments .: 160.04
<S> a week passed by .: 54.64
<S> i forget how , but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy . her ladyship is waiting to receive you , gentlemen , said the servant , who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress .: 44.01
<S> but he can easily become one , if he is not already ; it is no uncommon thing in italy .: 42.26
<S> but what is the matter , albert ?: 10.78
<S> besides , i shall only take the time to go and return . yes , yes , i understand , said danglars , and then in a low tone , he added , to paris , no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him .: 24.34
<S> to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected ; they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the people s misery .: 89.98
<S> he had contemplated danger with a smile , and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher , pain , thou art not an evil . he had , moreover , looked upon the customs officer wounded to death , and , whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter , or the chill of human sentiment , this sight had made but slight impression upon him .: 108.82
<S> it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength .: 149.86
<S> terror was so strongly painted on his face , covered with a cold sweat , that d artagnan took pity on him , and casting upon him a look of contempt , stop , said he , i will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you .: 43.26
<S> the guests chapter 40 .: 26.58
<S> but this sufficed for jacopo , who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of position a superiority which edmond had concealed from all others .: 89.90
<S> well , said athos , when aramis and he were in the boat again , are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting mazarin ? you are wisdom incarnate , athos , aramis replied .: 48.07
<S> i must find them within three days . three days are a short time and france is large . no matter ; you know the word must ; with that word great things are done . and when do you set out ? i am now on my road . good luck to you . and to you a good journey . perhaps we shall meet on our road . that is not probable . who knows ?: 51.09
<S> but , by degrees , watch chains , necklaces , parti colored scarves , embroidered bodices , velvet vests , elegantly worked stockings , striped gaiters , and silver buckles for the shoes , all disappeared ; and gaspard caderousse , unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor , had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities , both for himself and wife , although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung , more for the shelter than the profit it afforded .: 126.01
<S> however , it does not signify ; he has a letter of credit on me , so i must see him when he requires his money . then , throwing himself back in his carriage , danglars called out to his coachman , in a voice that might be heard across the road , to the chamber of deputies . apprised in time of the visit paid him , monte cristo had , from behind the blinds of his pavilion , as minutely observed the baron , by means of an excellent lorgnette , as danglars himself had scrutinized the house , garden , and servants .: 56.49
<S> reload the muskets , grimaud , said athos , and we , gentlemen , will go on with our breakfast , and resume our conversation .: 34.42
<S> prove it , danglars .: 60.14
<S> amongst us a simpleton , possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity , who has an enemy to destroy , or some near relation to dispose of , goes straight to the grocer s or druggist s , gives a false name , which leads more easily to his detection than his real one , and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping , purchases five or six grammes of arsenic if he is really a cunning fellow , he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers , and thereby becomes only five or six times more easily traced ; then , when he has acquired his specific , he administers duly to his enemy , or near kinsman , a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst , and which , without rhyme or reason , makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood .: 109.89
<S> it was not over the downfall of the man , but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea , that they rejoiced , and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence .: 71.56
<S> you had better see him , for his madness is amusing . i will see them both , returned the inspector ; i must conscientiously perform my duty . this was the inspector s first visit ; he wished to display his authority .: 39.50
<S> if you can , my dear d artagnan , answer for mademoiselle oh , monsieur , be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting paris . then , said aramis , this falls out very well . he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring , and gave the billet to kitty .: 30.61
<S> with a full heart and burning head he desired olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn , which he observed within gunshot range , a little in advance of the place they had reached .: 84.53
<S> this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual , but speak to dante s , and seeing that he received no reply , go to the bed , and thus discover all .: 30.43
<S> sire , replied tre ville , without lowering his voice in the least , either order my musketeer to be restored to me , or let him be tried . he shall be tried , said the cardinal .: 35.72
<S> eh , it was that that did the business ; after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak .: 107.97
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> ah , la ramee !: 10.85
<S> do you know i always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel ? dear , good rene e , whispered villefort , as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker .: 66.56
<S> overcome by example , grumbling to himself , nevertheless , porthos stretched out his hand , and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by d artagnan : all for one , one for all . that s well !: 75.74
<S> pray tell me , is it sympathy of heart ? no ; of taste , continued franz gravely .: 66.06
<S> why did her father ask for this key which she always kept , and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment ?: 89.96
<S> the insult chapter 89 .: 36.25
<S> on the opposite side two cavaliers , one covered with a gilt cuirass , the other wearing simply a buff doublet , from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet , charged in front .: 55.72
<S> you are about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word , and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied .: 44.49
<S> to save a man , to spare a father s feelings , or a mother s sensibility , is not to do a good action , but a simple deed of humanity . at these words , uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness , madame de morcerf replied : it is very fortunate for my son , monsieur , that he found such a friend , and i thank god that things are thus . and merce de s raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude , that the count fancied he saw tears in them .: 44.10
<S> monte cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl s arm , drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat , and said with a paternal smile : my child , believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of providence and the love of maximilian . valentine gave him a look full of gratitude , and remained as docile as a child .: 27.78
<S> the duke thanked monsieur de chavigny for having , as he said , cleaned his drawing paper for him ; he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in mazarin s life .: 78.07
<S> albert wrote to request me to come to the opera , doubtless that i might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you . probably , said monte cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity .: 35.58
<S> d artagnan was over him at a bound , and said to the englishman , pointing his sword to his throat , i could kill you , my lord , you are completely in my hands ; but i spare your life for the sake of your sister . d artagnan was at the height of joy ; he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand , whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his face .: 37.13
<S> athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking .: 113.47
<S> both were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance .: 139.18
<S> the bell and bottle tavern and now let us leave mademoiselle danglars and her friend pursuing their way to brussels , and return to poor andrea cavalcanti , so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune .: 92.96
<S> oh , oh ! replied d artagnan , straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance , it is the murmur of the populace in revolution . we must fly , said the queen .: 34.78
<S> ah , my dear , replied d artagnan , upon that very horse i came to paris . what , does monsieur know this horse ? said mousqueton .: 30.32
<S> arrested at compiegne , they have been carried to rueil ; at rueil they have been questioned by the cardinal , who has either kept them near him or sent them to saint germain .: 45.02
<S> without you i was a dead man thrice dead . but one recovers , sir , as you perceive , replied raoul , and we have but had a little bath . oh !: 53.12
<S> for stealing . for stealing !: 233.34
<S> have you had any account of it ? none .: 21.91
<S> come , finish your cup of coffee , said monte cristo ; the history is ended . chapter 78 .: 36.80
<S> d artagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed , saying , let us go . at this moment laporte reappeared .: 28.75
<S> the carriage started at a measured pace , without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry .: 43.95
<S> i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack . be of good cheer , replied dante s ; your strength will return . and as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside faria , and took his hands .: 54.39
<S> was it not by chance he caused the earth to be dug up ?: 41.35
<S> we have heard all it was necessary we should hear ; besides , i don t prevent you from listening , but i must be gone . you must be gone ! said porthos ; and if the cardinal asks for you , what answer can we make ? you will not wait till he asks ; you will speak first , and tell him that i am gone on the lookout , because certain expressions of our host have given me reason to think the road is not safe .: 38.65
<S> d artagnan , more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the abbe d herblay , which contrasted so strongly with those of the musketeer aramis , remained staring with wide open eyes at the face of his friend .: 47.56
<S> monte cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands , as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts .: 38.19
<S> but where is franz ? in the first carriage , with m. de villefort , who considers him already as one of the family . 40024m such was the conversation in almost all the carriages ; these two sudden deaths , so quickly following each other , astonished everyone , but no one suspected the terrible secret which m. d avrigny had communicated , in his nocturnal walk to m. de villefort .: 66.87
<S> you see ? he said to porthos .: 15.68
<S> their appearance , although it was not quite at ease , excited by its carelessness , at once full of dignity and submission , the admiration of d artagnan , who beheld in these two men demigods , and in their leader an olympian jupiter , armed with all his thunders .: 65.79
<S> not at all , i assure you . but where will you manage to stow me ? in the chamber overhead . surely that is where you yourselves sleep ? never mind that ; we have a second bed in the adjoining room . caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment .: 48.61
<S> the lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister , and became enamoured of her amorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her .: 62.51
<S> indeed , this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men ; one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children . my dear athos , i admire you , but nevertheless we were in the wrong , after all . how , in the wrong ? said athos .: 43.64
<S> but d artagnan had now slipped through the window .: 17.72
<S> give us a light , said the other bearer , or i shall never find what i am looking for . the man with the torch complied , although not asked in the most polite terms .: 57.38
<S> i ve broken my man s skull , cried d artagnan .: 40.41
<S> i was sent there to intercept a correspondence between chalais and the archduke , and even then , when i was discovered i was nearly torn to pieces .: 61.95
<S> make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description , and when you have met with an eligible spot , visit it , and if it possess the advantages desired , purchase it at once in your own name .: 74.05
<S> and when jacopo inquired of him , what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me ? edmond replied , who knows ?: 64.52
<S> since i was a faithful servant , my lord , to cardinal richelieu during his life , it stands to reason that now , after his death , i should serve you well , in defiance of the whole world . with regard to myself , monsieur de rochefort , replied mazarin , i am not , like monsieur de richelieu , all powerful .: 41.90
<S> begone , if you do not desire to see me dash my head against that wall before your eyes ! very well , it is your own doing .: 41.97
<S> her son ? said he .: 14.82
<S> are you ambitious ?: 19.63
<S> frightful !: 85.37
<S> the fact is , said d artagnan , if men are punished for imprudence and triviality , this poor king deserves punishment .: 71.77
<S> have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it ?: 55.95
<S> everything was in readiness .: 22.11
<S> i was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation , that i am sure i was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude i feel toward you .: 78.37
<S> all day dante s walked up and down his cell .: 26.34
<S> i should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major . and you would have flattered him , for certainly , as you say , he has no manner .: 32.50
<S> when he quitted me , he bade me be of good courage , and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence .: 57.59
<S> he had always something or other to do .: 62.73
<S> while he was listening to this recital , delivered with the greatest simplicity , the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment , as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence , courage , and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years .: 36.76
<S> so you see , my dear friend , that if you are not in a hurry , i am very much in a hurry . aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion , and took leave of him .: 13.73
<S> you will go to london , continued the cardinal .: 11.98
<S> we will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely united .: 86.67
<S> everything points to the conclusion , sire , said the minister of police , that death was not the result of suicide , as we first believed , but of assassination .: 50.76
<S> the file on the corso broke the line , and in a second all the carriages had disappeared .: 32.11
<S> forward , planchet , forward !: 57.32
<S> yes , indeed , i have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches , which would make the wealth of a dozen families , will be forever lost to those men who persecute me .: 45.90
<S> some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right ; that he intended to be civil , in his way , and that they would set the example of liberty of conscience , and the mob retired .: 53.66
<S> however , the two culprits advanced , and as they approached their faces became visible .: 35.95
<S> shall i go and offer her my services ? thought he .: 40.81
<S> just as , ordinarily , faces are colored by blood , his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid .: 87.94
<S> another motive had influenced albert s selection of his seat , who knew but that , thus advantageously placed , he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman , and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage , or a place in a princely balcony , from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival ?: 108.59
<S> well , ask your worthy jailer what favor i this instant solicited of him . you demanded a favor ? said the baron , suspiciously .: 142.89
<S> but you are able to have me arrested , you are able to have me tortured , you are able to have me hanged ; you are the master , and i could not have the least word to say .: 25.78
<S> and i set off without waiting for one , but he called me back and gave me this ; and he presented a little leather bag , plump and giving out a golden jingle .: 45.02
<S> meanwhile fernand made his appearance , poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand ; then hastily swallowing it , went to sit down at the first vacant place , and this was , by mere chance , placed next to the seat on which poor merce de s had fallen half fainting , when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dante s .: 73.69
<S> but to return to our millions . certainly , said danglars , in the most natural tone in the world .: 23.54
<S> at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door .: 19.75
<S> porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to dine .: 69.12
<S> villefort s brow darkened more and more , his white lips and clenched teeth filled dante s with apprehension .: 69.93
<S> grimaud entered .: 24.30
<S> the best swordsman in the kingdom , my lord , said d artagnan .: 17.52
<S> the duke smiled .: 12.63
<S> besides , there was no tranquillity in paris itself .: 42.95
<S> at midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard .: 55.58
<S> a physician was sought for , but none was yet found .: 96.48
<S> do you know her ? milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid .: 35.80
<S> is your love returned ? i suppose so , said andrea with a triumphant smile , since i am accepted .: 47.99
<S> there was a secret communication between the cardinal s apartments and those of the queen ; and through this corridor mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit anne of austria .: 39.01
<S> athos did the same .: 20.64
<S> the two rooms looked on to the street a fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage .: 95.54
<S> my first care was to run to the door ; he had left the key in it , taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock .: 39.91
<S> where are you come from , sir ?: 24.44
<S> these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by danglars , and restored him to some degree of tranquillity .: 62.81
<S> four hours later he was in neufcha tel .: 16.20
<S> he found the prisoner in the same position , as if fixed there , his eyes swollen with weeping .: 37.38
<S> in a recess was a kind of divan , surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards , and the handles resplendent with gems ; from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass , of beautiful shape and color , while the feet rested on a turkey carpet , in which they sunk to the instep ; tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered , and also in front of another door , leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated .: 65.85
<S> speak , then , i am all ears . d artagnan related his adventure with mme .: 27.47
<S> i saw madame de saint me ran only last year at marseilles , when i was coming back from algiers , said cha teau renaud ; she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old , from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body .: 47.74
<S> brave , rash , and enterprising , this was not the first time he had risked his life in such attempts .: 38.77
<S> be prudent !: 102.19
<S> place that table there , said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of felton .: 65.77
<S> what procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against m. magendie or m. flourens , in consequence of the rabbits , cats , and guinea pigs they have killed ? not one .: 100.29
<S> it was now nine o clock .: 8.40
<S> better study a little common prudence .: 409.48
<S> i knight you , monsieur le comte . then turning to aramis , he said : it is now your turn , monsieur le chevalier . the same ceremony recommenced , with the same words , whilst winter unlaced his leather cuirass , that he might disguise himself like the king .: 34.05
<S> i knew very well that they tired out their executioners , but i did not believe them so strong against their lovers ! alas !: 65.96
<S> you appear to be a brave young man ; besides , your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness . i will do , without a promise and voluntarily , all that i can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the queen .: 34.64
<S> to prison with him !: 50.47
<S> a man of from thirty five to forty years of age , dressed in deep black , had just entered , accompanied by a young woman dressed after the eastern style .: 32.71
<S> he passed through several apartments , of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea , and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness .: 52.50
<S> you were in the south of france , i think ? yes , replied andrea , with an embarrassed air , i was in the south of france . a carriage was to await you at nice ? precisely so ; and it conveyed me from nice to genoa , from genoa to turin , from turin to chambe ry , from chambe ry to pont de beauvoisin , and from pont de beauvoisin to paris . 30133m indeed ?: 36.67
<S> let us get ready , gentlemen . but this second letter , said athos , you forget that ; it appears to me , however , that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened .: 40.48
<S> now , if your mistress is not dead , if it is she we have just seen , you will meet with her again some day or other .: 34.39
<S> i do . in that case i will go . and the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations .: 32.91
<S> yes , replied m. de boville ; i myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 , and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers .: 46.99
<S> m. de tre ville received him as if he had seen him that same morning ; only , when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual , he informed him that the company of dessessart was on duty at the louvre , and that he might repair at once to his post .: 26.51
<S> he then looked at the objects near him .: 22.90
<S> then all was dark again .: 51.36
<S> gondy related to them the insults he had received at the palais royal and retailed the jests of beautin , the count de villeroy and marechal de la meilleraie .: 44.82
<S> if it is written yonder , in heaven , that the duc de beaufort is to escape , he will escape ; and all the precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it . mazarin started .: 31.62
<S> but these forces increase as we go higher , so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base .: 106.64
<S> no one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged with others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of royalty .: 78.87
<S> well , will you take me , or shall i take edward ? madame de villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer , but to all her inquiries m. de villefort remained mute and cold as a statue .: 38.80
<S> if you do not believe that it is my father , say so immediately ; and if , on the contrary , you believe it to be him , state your reasons for doing so . beauchamp looked at albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him , and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind .: 44.03
<S> as he had foreseen , lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after raoul s departure .: 39.59
<S> i might not always be content with that answer , replied the visitor , for i come from one to whom everyone must be at home .: 46.64
<S> here i am back again , and we are going to be happy . yes , yes , my boy , so we will so we will , replied the old man ; but how shall we be happy ?: 26.43
<S> then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard , and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips .: 47.35
<S> you know it is you alone whom i love . how can i know that ? by the scorn i will throw upon her . d artagnan took a pen and wrote : madame , until the present moment i could not believe that it was to me your first two letters were addressed , so unworthy did i feel myself of such an honor ; besides , i was so seriously indisposed that i could not in any case have replied to them .: 43.37
<S> i remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water , and when i leaned over to ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our palikares.14 besides the rowers , the boat contained only the women , my father , mother , selim , and myself .: 70.62
<S> the baroness was also surprised , and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper , where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations .: 51.95
<S> the devil it does ! said la ramee , scratching his head ; you are in the wrong to tell me that , my lord .: 25.62
<S> you would then be in present possession of the letter .: 33.05
<S> in eight days the campaign would open , and he would be compelled to leave paris ; d artagnan had no time for a prolonged love siege .: 52.00
<S> he felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything .: 46.56
<S> as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance d artagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain , followed by his three friends , directing their course , as well as they could guess , toward london .: 35.65
<S> d artagnan in his fortieth year .: 20.31
<S> we are invited , replied d artagnan , to pass the night with m. groslow .: 21.11
<S> we know him , said athos , he never left the king . yes , that is he .: 18.85
<S> it was then observable that the substance was greenish .: 39.05
<S> now , as d artagnan had been the hero of these two fights , it was upon him that all the felicitations fell , which athos , porthos , and aramis abandoned to him , not only as good comrades , but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his .: 53.93
<S> peppino chapter 115 .: 61.69
<S> they descended the great staircase , taking with them all the guards they found on their road , and crying out , to arms !: 53.27
<S> selim made ready his lance .: 144.85
<S> what number was it that rang ? number 3. run , waiter ! at this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled .: 127.44
<S> being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood , he did not then press his inquiries , but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her , or receive an avowal proprio motu .: 67.21
<S> do not speak so loud , young man don t speak so loud .: 31.68
<S> wait , then , said the duke , fumbling in his pocket .: 14.32
<S> d artagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding ; they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door , leaped upon them , buried their spurs in their sides , and set off at full gallop .: 32.27
<S> and morrel was right , for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal .: 46.67
<S> raoul has no fortune other than i possess , poor child !: 117.33
<S> yes , happy as myself , said he .: 22.62
<S> milady , who had arisen , threw herself quickly into the armchair , her head thrown back , her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled , her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace , one hand on her heart , and the other hanging down .: 36.34
<S> let us go on .: 10.52
<S> one thought in particular tormented him : namely , that during his journey hither he had sat so still , whereas he might , a dozen times , have plunged into the sea , and , thanks to his powers of swimming , for which he was famous , have gained the shore , concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel , escaped to spain or italy , where merce de s and his father could have joined him .: 73.10
<S> this time i have merely come from cadiz . you have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit .: 70.66
<S> the stranger ascended a rough staircase , and before a table , illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness , he perceived the abbe in a monk s dress , with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages .: 61.61
<S> then he would be free to make his researches , not perhaps entirely at liberty , for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him .: 46.51
<S> if you reveal it to anyone in the world , i shall be lost , and perhaps yourself likewise . oh , my god ! listen .: 27.89
<S> we will judge you in spite of your silence .: 33.12
<S> your very devoted husband , baron danglars . the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful letter , and saw him , notwithstanding his self control , change color once or twice .: 123.82
<S> the queen read it , recognized the writing , and , since there were no details in it of what had occurred , asked for particulars .: 58.79
<S> ah , then , madame , i was able for one instant to be alone with you .: 23.04
<S> so much the worse , sir , said anne of austria ; so much the worse , at least for the queen , for to day she has need of the same courage and the same devotion . what ! exclaimed d artagnan , does the queen , surrounded as she is by such devoted servants , such wise counselors , men , in short , so great by merit or position does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier ? anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it .: 47.66
<S> in fact , four men such as they were four men devoted to one another , from their purses to their lives ; four men always supporting one another , never yielding , executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common ; four arms threatening the four cardinal points , or turning toward a single point must inevitably , either subterraneously , in open day , by mining , in the trench , by cunning , or by force , open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain , however well it might be defended , or however distant it may seem .: 145.74
<S> he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted .: 20.55
<S> what are the turks to such men as the comte de la fere and the abbe d herblay ? ah , his friend is with him ? said raoul .: 22.01
<S> this scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count .: 80.46
<S> with the assistance of blaisois and grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over .: 84.17
<S> it will require four or five days for the transmission of the money , four or five days for her to return ; that makes ten days .: 47.78
<S> and what was this man s name ? danglars . what rank did he hold on board ? he was supercargo . and had you been captain , should you have retained him in his employment ? not if the choice had remained with me , for i had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts . good again !: 85.31
<S> his eye , elate with happiness , was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of hayde e , when suddenly the door opened .: 46.03
<S> you asked for candor and you have it .: 106.28
<S> i know that you were one of them , my uncle , and that you cried louder than the others : she must die . therefore i warn you , and listen well to my words , that they may be engraved upon your memory , never to be forgotten : this murder , which has robbed me of everything this murder , which has deprived me of my name this murder , which has impoverished me this murder , which has made me corrupt , wicked , implacable i shall summon you to account for it first and then those who were your accomplices , when i discover them ! with hatred in his eyes , foaming at his mouth , and his fist extended , mordaunt had advanced one more step , a threatening , terrible step , toward de winter .: 52.92
<S> peppino , put out the torch . peppino obeyed , and franz and the count were in utter darkness , except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare , more evident since peppino had put out his torch , was visible along the wall .: 68.30
<S> the queen , though occupied by a thousand details , tried to catch the gascon s eye ; but he , with his wonted prudence , had mingled with the crowd .: 42.57
<S> and if you were mistaken , doctor if it were not my daughter if i should come one day , pale as a spectre , and say to you , assassin , you have killed my child ! hold if that should happen , although i am a christian , m. d avrigny , i should kill myself . well , said the doctor , after a moment s silence , i will wait . villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words .: 26.06
<S> my dear count , you can not imagine how my mind is harassed .: 22.87
<S> i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me . you are mistaken , my dear viscount . prove it to me . do you wish me to do so ? yes . well , i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron . by whom are you charged ? by the baron himself . oh , said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable .: 28.55
<S> nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of athos than i have ; but i like better to hear my sword clang against lances than against staves .: 123.73
<S> yes , athos , i know what you mean : we shall do very well at the parpaillot . let us go to the parpaillot , then , for here the walls are like sheets of paper . d artagnan , who was accustomed to his friend s manner of acting , and who perceived immediately , by a word , a gesture , or a sign from him , that the circumstances were serious , took athos s arm , and went out without saying anything .: 27.89
<S> because he had no cash to save .: 42.74
<S> she draws only fifteen feet .: 218.29
<S> the swiss became as purple as a peony .: 44.88
<S> let us send in our names , and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of france .: 34.49
<S> the guards looked on it with indifference .: 40.59
<S> there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly .: 22.06
<S> i am tired of hearing only of market reports , of the end of the month , of the rise and fall of spanish funds , of haitian bonds .: 90.69
<S> this wine will give you strength , drink ! and she put the glass to the lips of the young woman , who drank mechanically .: 36.62
<S> such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the count of monte cristo s door .: 27.53
<S> why , the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by god for each other . my lord , cried the queen , you forget that i have never said that i love you . but you have never told me that you did not love me ; and truly , to speak such words to me would be , on the part of your majesty , too great an ingratitude .: 32.33
<S> i can not endure the modern school of painting . you are perfectly right in objecting to them , for this one great fault that they have not yet had time to become old . or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen , bartoloni , and canova ? all foreign artists , for , as you may perceive , i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors . you have a right to be unjust to them , monsieur ; they are your compatriots . but all this may come later , when we shall be better known to each other .: 71.55
<S> pray continue . well , then , listen .: 37.55
<S> my god , my god , my god ! she knelt upon a cushion and prayed , with her head buried between her palpitating arms .: 31.00
<S> monsieur de mazarin is not a man of genius , as i thought , he is a man of no origin once a servant of cardinal bentivoglio , and he got on by intrigue .: 37.75
<S> how should i know what a horse is ?: 33.71
<S> i beg you to do so , replied albert .: 8.91
<S> there only remained in the closet of the wounded duke laporte and patrick .: 56.66
<S> then , with a sigh , poor hayde e ! murmured he .: 27.45
<S> he uttered an exclamation of delight , for the large handwriting of porthos was discernible , and underneath some lines traced by his worthy spouse .: 47.60
<S> have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend , though , in reality , it was the first time you had ever met ?: 78.46
<S> it seems like a woman !: 21.72
<S> judge if i should not put myself under its protection . flattery was at that period very current , and m. de tre ville loved incense as well as a king , or even a cardinal .: 80.81
<S> i have extricated you from misery , felton ; i have caused you to be named lieutenant ; i once saved your life , you know on what occasion .: 67.39
<S> duty before everything .: 398.58
<S> captivity : the first day chapter liii .: 32.98
<S> the dull driver , smoking his pipe , was plodding along toward the limits of the faubourg saint denis , where no doubt he ordinarily had his station .: 57.16
<S> will finish by shouting out , down with all the people i have mentioned , each in his turn .: 76.78
<S> the result , then , of six more such months as this would be to reduce the third rate house to despair . oh , said danglars , becoming very pale , how you are running on ! let us imagine seven such months , continued monte cristo , in the same tone .: 59.57
<S> noirtier watched the expression of each one , and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude .: 76.30
<S> i rushed towards the staircase , clutching my hair , and uttering a groan of horror .: 25.26
<S> valentine uttered a cry of horror ; morrel took her in his arms , as if to defend her from some unknown danger .: 22.99
<S> and you , porthos , continued the count , as if in consideration for d artagnan s embarrassment , you , the best heart , the best friend , the best soldier that i know you , with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne , and who , sooner or later , must receive your reward from an intelligent king you , my dear porthos , you , a gentleman in manners , in tastes and in courage , you are as culpable as d artagnan . porthos blushed , but with pleasure rather than with confusion ; and yet , bowing his head , as if humiliated , he said : yes , yes , my dear count , i feel that you are right . athos arose .: 42.80
<S> he had reported to aramis what had taken place , and aramis , not less distrustful than he , had increased his suspicions .: 36.53
<S> what is my daughter doing ? asked madame danglars .: 14.63
<S> here it is at last , he said , not without some trouble , though . yes , was the answer , but it has lost nothing by waiting . as he said this , the man came towards edmond , who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him , and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence .: 52.38
<S> yes , monsieur , said d artagnan , bowing , we have had that honor .: 14.50

<S> what did mazarin do ? stormed ! suggested athos .: 83.79
<S> when you spoke to me at the cemetery , i answered you my heart was softened ; when you arrived here , i allowed you to enter .: 42.86
<S> larboard your helm , cried the captain to the steersman .: 77.47
<S> it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting .: 65.71
<S> hers had been accomplished ; it remains , possibly , for us to accomplish ours . i have sometimes thought as you do , athos . she had a son , that unhappy woman ? yes . have you ever heard of him ? never . he must be about twenty three years of age , said athos , in a low tone .: 45.55
<S> but this was not so easy a matter , for the streets were thronged with people , and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events ; and at rome there are four great events in every year , the carnival , holy week , corpus christi , and the feast of st. peter .: 65.75
<S> he had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever , to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial .: 35.91
<S> her first movement was repellent .: 48.97
<S> bonacieux wept all day , like a true mercer , not being at all a military man , as he himself informed us .: 96.04
<S> the cardinal rose , and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england .: 23.59
<S> i say that she is a hostage for the parisians , answered the cardinal .: 18.36
<S> he remembered how at the louvre he had often seen , as she passed by him in the full radiance of her dazzling charms , the beautiful madame de longueville .: 37.69
<S> dear du vallon , does one forget the happiest days of flowery youth , one s dearest friends , the dangers we have dared together ?: 103.82
<S> however , his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile , so much was every mind engaged , and so solemn was the situation .: 69.22
<S> my first visit is due to my father , though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me . 0029m right , dante s , quite right .: 38.23
<S> at length he saw a dark mass , against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash ; but the vehicle turned to one side , leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome .: 36.87
<S> his smile is so sweet when he addresses me , that i forget it ever can be bitter to others .: 80.28
<S> athos listened to his projects , then shook his head , and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness .: 37.19
<S> carefully closing the box door , ali placed himself before it , while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian .: 87.62
<S> it was fourteen years , day for day , since dante s arrest .: 44.27
<S> he had scarcely been a week at leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins , contraband cottons , english powder , and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark .: 68.94
<S> beauchamp , who had watched with sincere pity the young man s paroxysm of grief , approached him .: 50.62
<S> he is of no earthly use to anybody . and you , monsieur du vallon , is that your advice ?: 26.23
<S> oh , good lord !: 17.90
<S> no quarter ! cried a voice in french , answering to that of winter , which made them tremble .: 51.91
<S> well , my dear dante s , are you now free ? inquired the owner .: 16.97
<S> then , said albert , you became the property of this man ? 40080m no , replied hayde e , he did not dare to keep us , so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople .: 47.52
<S> why , he is surrounded by sultanas , like a turk .: 34.35
<S> spanish policy and austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the louvre , where they had as yet but partisans ; and he , richelieu the french minister , the national minister would be ruined .: 96.08
<S> the other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row .: 42.82
<S> if i am not saved i shall be avenged . you are not a woman , said athos , coldly and sternly .: 21.59
<S> demand anything you want , and i will hasten to have you furnished with it . but i have neither my women nor my servants . you shall have all , madame .: 52.15
<S> te deums were chanted in camp , and afterward throughout france .: 218.27
<S> good night , friend . and andrea , after placing six pieces of five francs each in the man s hand , leaped lightly on to the pathway .: 68.73
<S> you say she is in a convent ? replied porthos .: 20.38
<S> the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper .: 25.58
<S> you know , bragelonne , said athos , i never speak without reflection . well , comte , i am going instantly , interrupted the duchess , to send for the prince de marsillac , who is happily , in paris just now .: 45.73
<S> he had made up his mind to write to her the next day .: 12.60
<S> you have seen the count , you say ? i have only just left him . and has he conformed to all that the letter specified ? he has . do you understand it ? not in the least . there is a dupe somewhere . at all events , it is neither you nor i. certainly not . well , then why , it does not much concern us , do you think it does ? no ; i agree with you there .: 36.50
<S> as he departed , danglars approached , and said , well , it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at porto ferrajo ? yes , most satisfactory , my dear danglars . well , so much the better , said the supercargo ; for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty . dante s has done his , replied the owner , and that is not saying much .: 37.71
<S> but what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred , the profound hatred , the inveterate hatred of milady , was increased by his not having killed her brother in law .: 55.00
<S> her husband , who , when he married her , had no other patrimony than his noble probity , his first rate ability , and his spotless reputation , wished to possess as much as his wife .: 37.76
<S> tomorrow you shall be free . i had but one wish ; that was that he should kill me .: 38.94
<S> your majesty wishes , then you to say what you would do in her place , mazarin hastened to reply .: 41.37
<S> he swam on still , and already the terrible cha teau had disappeared in the darkness .: 51.18
<S> one thing only puzzles me , namely , how franz d e pinay will like a grandfather who can not be separated from his wife .: 62.48
<S> you should not speak so to an old friend like me , caderousse , as you said just now ; you are a native of marseilles , i am do you know then now what you are ? no , but i was brought up in corsica ; you are old and obstinate , i am young and wilful .: 40.69

<S> there was no occasion to push the door , it was wide open .: 23.34
<S> what are yanina and its vizier to you , edmond ?: 96.60

<S> gimblou , a glass of wine . well , how has all gone off ? zounds !: 58.01
<S> i hope you will not complain now ? said the jeweller .: 28.25

<S> the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated .: 80.57
<S> ah , here you are , monsieur , she said in her naturally calm voice ; but how pale you are !: 30.96
<S> i had an affianced husband , a man whom i loved , and who loved me a heart like yours , felton , a man like you .: 30.70
<S> yes . well , as for me , i prefer hannibal . and why , pray , master la ramee ? asked the duke .: 21.40
<S> will you not come with me ? he said ; i shall pass by blois . raoul turned toward athos , who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to go .: 21.24
<S> the young people felt a mutual esteem ; but the queen , who at first sanctioned their affection , changed her mind , and monsieur , the duc d orleans , who had encouraged the familiarity between them , has forbidden his daughter to think any more about the union .: 61.95

<S> the king s children next arrived the princess charlotte , a beautiful , fair haired child , with tears in her eyes , and the duke of gloucester , a boy eight or nine years old , whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing pride .: 96.42
<S> many might take for their device the epithet strong , which formed the second part of his motto , but very few gentlemen could lay claim to the faithful , which constituted the first .: 131.71
<S> ah , my dear doctor , said the procureur , heaven declares itself against my house !: 27.50
<S> occasionally , by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon , the road stretched itself before them , white and solitary ; the flash extinct , all remained in darkness .: 68.97
<S> follow him , said athos .: 10.19
<S> porthos , my friend , said d artagnan , don t distrust providence !: 16.98
<S> i certainly think you act wisely in so doing , said the priest .: 75.52
<S> consider , said aramis , if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world , that woman was punished by the will of heaven .: 59.70
<S> come , let us see what you will do for me . everything that your eminence may please to command me , was the reply .: 26.01

<S> it is this : i swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard on the 5th of february , 1815 , between nine and ten o clock in the evening ; and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath . the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor , which prevented his answering for some moments ; then , overcoming his manifest repugnance , he pronounced the required oath , but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members , who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly , which he did .: 71.52
<S> in military dress he was , indeed , as we have stated , a very handsome man .: 37.36
<S> if , when you arrive at cours la reine , you find no one , you must go on to saint germain .: 31.33
<S> you may think my departure strange and foolish , said the young man ; you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one .: 63.19
<S> he said very good , muttered the major , then sir replied he .: 89.37
<S> the cardinal would reply , with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic , strong at once by power and genius , you should not have allowed yourself to be taken . then milady collected all her energies , murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of felton the only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen ; and like a serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength , she enveloped felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination .: 71.94
<S> june and july were the terrible months with athos .: 228.18
<S> galloping through the bushes . the count !: 93.08

<S> what ? said monte cristo .: 8.08
<S> i shall be at home till midday , or if not , i will leave a receipt with my steward . the money you desire shall be at your house by ten o clock tomorrow morning , my dear count , replied danglars .: 26.42
<S> most palpable proofs , said he , as you may perceive . you think , then , that i may rely on the count s promises ? certainly i do . you are sure he will keep his word with me ? to the letter , but at the same time , remember , we must continue to play our respective parts .: 33.37
<S> i was so delighted to see her again !: 19.56
<S> night overtook her ; she stopped , and slept at an inn .: 60.89
<S> i know you to be a man of resolution ; and your services , well directed , instead of leading you to ill , might be very advantageous to you .: 56.02
<S> some one ! la ramee ran in haste to obey the call .: 52.72
<S> your having sent for me is another proof of your affection .: 59.51
<S> that reminds me , he said , that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds ; i have already signed two : will you allow me to do the same to the others ? pray do so . there was a moment s silence , during which the noise of the banker s pen was alone heard , while monte cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling .: 34.00
<S> i have committed no crime .: 33.57
<S> the fifth of september chapter 31 .: 13.62
<S> but really no matter , go on . the journey of that day had been long and wearing ; it was a cold day , the eleventh of october , there was no inn or chateau in the village and the homes of the peasants were poor and unattractive .: 56.32
<S> my dear fellow , don t speak like that of monsieur groslow .: 23.90
<S> though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle , owing to the reported approach of harrison and the king .: 81.39
<S> true , i forgot ; provided he can get money out of the people , that is all he wants . the street of saint honore , when the cardinal and his party passed through it , was crowded by an assemblage who , standing in groups , discussed the edicts of that memorable day .: 63.76
<S> what have you done ? i have avenged myself ! said he .: 16.55
<S> you hear , comminges ? said the queen .: 16.86
<S> as for his suspicions , once on terra firma , once that he had seen the indifferent , if not friendly , appearance of his hosts , his anxiety had quite disappeared , or rather , at sight of the goat , had turned to appetite .: 89.33
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> is my father here ? most undoubtedly , replied monte cristo ; your father , major bartolomeo cavalcanti . the expression of terror which , for the moment , had overspread the features of the young man , had now disappeared .: 28.69
<S> the prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape ; he called out his name and cried for help .: 69.41
<S> as captain of the musketeers , m. de tre ville had the right of entry at all times .: 22.55
<S> during this time he occupied himself in making figures , with his watch by his side .: 48.00
<S> during this time , exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief , the royal army led a joyous life , neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp .: 145.23
<S> this look told him all , and his anger waxed hot .: 77.22
<S> it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened , and the king entered .: 23.61
<S> noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak .: 10.13
<S> not monsieur d artagnan ? exclaimed the commissary .: 19.71
<S> you know the same thing was done for saint stephen of florence , saint george constantinian of parma , and even for the order of malta .: 58.80
<S> quemadmodum inter c lorum immensitatem . aramis cast a glance upon d artagnan to see what effect all this produced , and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws .: 94.48
<S> it turned out as d artagnan had foreseen .: 26.59
<S> peste , if he is giving away hats like that , porthos , let us look out and both demand a regiment to morrow .: 78.94
<S> yes . without accident ? perfectly safe and sound . porthos , whilst i get up , watch the cardinal .: 78.98
<S> alas , i understand . think of the offense you have committed toward me , madame !: 32.29
<S> yes . must i leave alone ? no . whom am i to take with me ?: 38.50
<S> no , no ; it is as i have said , maximilian , there is no one in the world of whom i can ask help but yourself and my grandfather , who is little better than a corpse no support to cling to but my mother in heaven ! i see that you are right , logically speaking , said maximilian ; but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today . i feel the same as regards yourself . said valentine ; and i own that , if you have no stronger proof to give me i have another , replied maximilian ; but i fear you will deem it even more absurd than the first . so much the worse , said valentine , smiling .: 44.49
<S> the latter smiled .: 22.66
<S> yes , said athos , it reminds me of a family jewel . it is beautiful , is it not ? said d artagnan .: 14.75
<S> as the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement , ran to the sacristy , dressed himself quickly in the choir robes , and cleaving , thanks to that uniform , the crowd that filled the temple , approached bazin , who , clad in his blue robe , was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir .: 75.87
<S> baptiste , give me yesterday s paper , cried beauchamp .: 53.28
<S> estafania , give up the keys of my drawers and my desks . for form s sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named ; but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that day .: 73.93
<S> olivain had ready the horses of the young men , and the lackeys of the count de guiche guarded carefully between them the spanish prisoner , mounted on a pony which had been bought for his use .: 37.70
<S> he sighed , and whispered a name , and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair a head like that of a magdalen by correggio was raised and turned towards him .: 56.08
<S> the suicide meanwhile monte cristo had also returned to town with emmanuel and maximilian .: 80.33
<S> and he had five millions in your hands alone !: 80.90
<S> and then , it must be confessed , fernand had never been hated he was only not precisely loved .: 65.36
<S> you have done this i hope so , at least . madame de villefort stretched out her hands , and fell on her knees .: 16.57
<S> true .: 73.16
<S> destroy him utterly and quit him not until he is dead ; the lives of five men are not safe , in my opinion , as long as he is on the earth . and without adding another word , grimaud , profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors , rushed from the room .: 49.62
<S> you can understand our disappointment when , arriving at a pretty little house on the skirts of a wood , which at a distance had quite a gay appearance , with its red roof and green shutters , we found nothing but a poor wretch bathed ah !: 100.71
<S> you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works , reports , performances and research .: 34.59
<S> there was little change in the cardinal ; still dressed with sedulous care , his hair well arranged and curled , his person perfumed , he looked , owing to his extreme taste in dress , only half his age .: 135.21
<S> he has killed the executioner of bethune in an access of passion , but now his fury is assuaged . de winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head .: 42.50
<S> the only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableau such is the instability of the human mind was the sullen face of grimaud , for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope .: 62.53
<S> the carriage stopped .: 13.17
<S> now , said he , that suffices begone ! which way ? the way you came . you wish me to get out at that window ? you got in very well . oh , you have some design against me , reverend sir . idiot !: 50.92
<S> he continued : so i was going away , but he called me back .: 30.73
<S> milady smiled at this thought , for felton was now her only hope her only means of safety .: 66.90
<S> what , asked the duke , what do you mean ? and he gave him the cane again , first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of pistache .: 33.47
<S> while he was doing this , d artagnan , having no better employment , amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers , who went away , one after another , following them with his eyes until they disappeared .: 60.81
<S> i live , because it is not ordained for me to die .: 30.80
<S> fifty thousand francs a year , said porthos .: 11.06
<S> grimaud , going in advance , followed the course which they were to take in the evening .: 31.52
<S> bonacieux in her power .: 42.31
<S> no , no , never ! cried milady .: 11.11
<S> yes , but they will make you then sign your declaration , and confront you with him you have denounced ; i will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation , for i know the fact well .: 54.18
<S> if you went to spain , would you not see the bull fights ?: 39.69
<S> your hand , athos ! and without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of affection , m. de tre ville seized his right hand and pressed it with all his might , without perceiving that athos , whatever might be his self command , allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him , and if possible , grew paler than he was before .: 49.70
<S> in fact , we must not dissemble that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave him serious uneasiness .: 45.16
<S> tis well , resumed the king .: 14.05
<S> their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared , and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet for behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future .: 165.50
<S> with a man like you i fear nothing . athos bowed .: 42.22
<S> my good charles , i particularly recommend to your care planchet , the laquais of monsieur d artagnan .: 82.55
<S> the day after the event , she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance ; they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain . oh , it is terrible ! and m. de boville retired with this exclamation , after expressing acute sympathy with the father .: 77.84
<S> i have not quitted you since yesterday , returned fernand sorrowfully .: 56.99
<S> bonacieux knocked , as at the shutter , three light and regular taps .: 92.45
<S> be silent , i will write . aramis accordingly took the quill , reflected for a few moments , wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand , and then with a voice soft and slow , as if each word had been scrupulously weighed , he read the following : my lord , the person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the rue d enfer .: 67.69
<S> he has been sent by cromwell to mazarin , and the queen guessed rightly ; we have been forestalled .: 29.84
<S> he had received a message from the prince , to whom he had hastened with olivain the instant he had received it .: 26.92
<S> gentlemen , said de winter , on reaching the gate of the town , let us do here as at paris let us separate to avoid suspicion .: 40.88
<S> yes , i see , for the young man raoul , said d artagnan .: 16.57
<S> franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained .: 56.44
<S> oh , my god !: 5.20
<S> when this operation was complete , he invited her to descend by offering her his hand .: 39.50
<S> morrel rose and advanced to the door ; but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair .: 17.68
<S> here is a beautiful lawn ; let us go on straight forwards . bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow , but obeyed ; however , he continued to take the left hand .: 38.04
<S> but if he be willing to accept my offers , will you oppose them ? you well know , edmond , that i am no longer a reasoning creature ; i have no will , unless it be the will never to decide .: 51.82
<S> twas too brief an enjoyment , and la ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of life .: 96.86
<S> he listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures , that the count , like himself , had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart .: 46.02
<S> explain yourself , then . noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on valentine s hand .: 27.75
<S> the one between the pillars on the first tier it seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh . did you observe anyone during the first act ? asked cha teau renaud .: 59.87
<S> and he touched his mule .: 30.98
<S> i met him on the boulevard , on my way here , said beauchamp .: 21.37
<S> for different reasons this was an agreeable proposition to them all , and it was therefore agreed that each should leave a very exact address and that upon the request of any of the associates a meeting should be convoked at a famous eating house in the rue de la monnaie , of the sign of the hermitage .: 93.86
<S> he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to m. noirtier ; but no one answered , the servants having , as we know , deserted the house .: 30.70
<S> take them , and if you need money for your expedition , sell them fearlessly , my lord .: 42.73
<S> up to this point , said faria , interrupting the thread of his narrative , this seems to you very meaningless , no doubt , eh ? oh , my friend , cried dante s , on the contrary , it seems as if i were reading a most interesting narrative ; go on , i beg of you . i will .: 30.85
<S> let this house be the first repaid , my son , and respect this man . father , i will , said maximilian .: 44.77
<S> the rigors which had attacked barrois gradually increased , the features of the face became quite altered , and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder .: 59.24
<S> he had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o clock ; fortunately the palazzo bracciano , which is on one side in the corso , and on the other in the square of the holy apostles , is hardly ten minutes walk from the ho tel de londres .: 39.89
<S> grimaud , according to custom , obeyed in silence ; the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to speak .: 59.87
<S> i sometimes wonder , replied athos , smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days , that we could form an association of men who would be , after twenty years of separation , still so closely bound together .: 80.08
<S> come , said the count , smiling with his own peculiar smile , not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven o clock tomorrow morning . vampa looked at albert with a kind of admiration ; he was not insensible to such a proof of courage .: 24.25
<S> come in here , monsieur chevalier , said she ; here we shall be alone , and can talk . and whose room is this , my dear child ? it is mine , monsieur chevalier ; it communicates with my mistress s by that door .: 45.42
<S> still further , his shirt had stuck to the wound , and he had lost only a few drops of blood .: 37.09
<S> fatality chapter l. chat between brother and sister chapter li .: 108.47
<S> the queen , on her part , thus chided , softened immediately and sat down , and in an almost weeping voice , letting her arms fall by her side , said : pardon me , sir , and attribute this violence to what i suffer .: 43.54
<S> at the royal arms of england you will find a young gentleman named mordaunt . yes , my lord ; and what am i to do with this young gentleman ? follow wherever he leads you . d artagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air .: 21.82
<S> put to catherine de medici , after the massacre of saint bartholomew : how have i played my little part ? to what do you allude ? asked monte cristo .: 55.39
<S> yes , was the reply , in a low voice .: 12.05
<S> but it seems you have come back rich , my boy , continued the tailor , looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dante s had thrown on the table .: 32.58
<S> c s ... and now , said the abbe , read this other paper ; and he presented to dante s a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it , which edmond read as follows : ... ing invited to dine by his holiness ... content with making me pay for my hat , ... serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara ... i declare to my nephew , guido spada ... ried in a place he knows ... the caves of the small ... essed of ingots , gold , money , ... know of the existence of this treasure , which ... lions of roman crowns , and which he ... ck from the small ... ings have been made ... ngle in the second ; ... tire to him ... ar spada . faria followed him with an excited look .: 144.35
<S> his hand of iron grasped , quick as lightning , firm as a pair of blacksmith s pincers , the soldier s throat .: 64.84
<S> was it not by chance the count of monte cristo bought that house ?: 30.25
<S> that s well , said athos , let us go home and read it . the note burned the hand of d artagnan .: 16.85
<S> m. de villefort s communications on the subject were very limited and concise ; he told her , in fact , that an explanation had taken place between m. noirtier , m. d e pinay , and himself , and that the marriage of valentine and franz would consequently be broken off .: 36.27
<S> come . the same cabriolet which had brought villefort took them back at full speed , and at this moment morrel rapped at monte cristo s door .: 48.27
<S> may i be hanged , said danglars , glancing at the bandit s dinner through the crevices of the door , may i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth ! and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat skin , which reminded him of the smell of the brandy .: 45.38
<S> gondy smiled , the queen s color rose and mazarin grew even paler .: 117.90
<S> indeed ? said athos .: 15.40
<S> the reason why i am now dissatisfied is that i have not a clear appreciation of the past .: 61.02
<S> tis raoul , who is come home . athos , as the name of raoul was pronounced , looked inquisitively at d artagnan , in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his face .: 36.81
<S> this last thought of love counseled her to make this last sacrifice .: 64.75
<S> has your excellency anything to ask me ? said vampa with a smile .: 21.60
<S> once a soldier , what would you do with me , a poor orphan , forlorn , without fortune , with nothing but a half ruined hut and a few ragged nets , the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother , and by my mother to me ?: 68.25
<S> good evening , madame , said the banker ; good evening , m. debray . probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day .: 48.52
<S> he was dead .: 13.20
<S> oh , not the least in the world , madame !: 15.73
<S> to no one , on my honor . everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the island of elba , and addressed to m. noirtier ? everybody , except the person who gave it to me . and that was too much , far too much , murmured villefort .: 34.09
<S> our house transacts business to the amount of a million a year , from which we derive an income of 40,000 francs .: 51.83
<S> his ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them ; he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore mercy .: 74.08
<S> he thanked the governor , bowed , and departed .: 28.64
<S> ah , my worthy gentlemen , cried i , what do you want ? you must have a ladder ? said he who appeared to be the leader of the party .: 21.17
<S> the clock of the invalides struck one .: 25.44
<S> everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour , when the same luminous track was again observed , and the swimmer was soon on board .: 72.80
<S> tis true .: 17.62
<S> richelieu , who passed his life in warding off blows which were forever aimed at him ! but he did ward them off , said de rochefort , and the reason was , that though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends .: 166.91
<S> and that diamond , cried caderousse , almost breathless with eager admiration , you say , is worth fifty thousand francs ? it is , without the setting , which is also valuable , replied the abbe , as he closed the box , and returned it to his pocket , while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper .: 49.29
<S> no , listen to me ; i have the true idea . let us see your idea , aramis , said athos , who felt much deference for the young musketeer .: 30.43
<S> do you not know the race ? said he .: 12.62
<S> eight days after , i was back again , madame .: 35.04
<S> on reaching her room euge nie locked her door , while louise fell on a chair .: 30.63
<S> do you not remember him ? yes ! said dante s , and without relinquishing merce de s hand clasped in one of his own , he extended the other to the catalan with a cordial air .: 30.31
<S> my wife has perhaps requested permission of monsieur athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen ; and he , as usual , has refused .: 51.83
<S> we will not constrain you to help us ; we enroll no one against his conscience , but we will compel you to act generously , even if you are not disposed to do so . you would call acting generously , knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you , that is what i should call becoming your accomplice .: 68.90
<S> she had forced us to accept a little souvenir , a magnificent spanish genet and an andalusian mule , which were beautiful to look upon .: 132.26
<S> if you are young , i will be your comrade ; if you are old , i will be your son .: 26.03
<S> the three valets passed without accident .: 25.13
<S> the prince smiled ; he despised flatterers , but he appreciated enthusiasts .: 112.56
<S> athos merely glanced at it .: 59.07
<S> you understand , my dear baron , that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases ; it was , perhaps , some plot against you . andrea looked steadily at monte cristo and disappeared in the second drawing room .: 51.69
<S> what are you going to tell me ? are we quite alone , my friend ? yes , quite ; but why all these precautions ? because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you , said the doctor .: 20.22
<S> you received me very coldly .: 77.46
<S> well , i must mortify myself .: 25.71
<S> he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner .: 36.67
<S> peste ! that s a fine age ! replied porthos .: 23.39
<S> madame , he said , you have wished to conquer the prince your brother that is to say , the greatest captain of the age ; and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it .: 58.68
<S> he finds the cooking detestable , replied porthos .: 70.59
<S> then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place . rest assured , cried the duchess , i shall do what i can .: 57.07
<S> athos ! muttered d artagnan ; you think of every one ; you are indeed a nobleman !: 33.84
<S> this noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream ; she grew pale and ran to the window , while mme .: 53.81
<S> i have sworn . and now , madame , try to make your peace with god , for you are judged by men ! milady let her head sink , as if crushed by this sentence .: 43.76
<S> but nothing escaped the count s notice , and he observed a little note , passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice , from the hand of madame danglars to that of the minister s secretary .: 59.60
<S> d artagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient .: 57.21
<S> stop , my friend , i have an idea . speak , monsieur . in your place , i would do one thing . what ? while his eminence was seeking for me in paris , i would take , without sound of drum or trumpet , the road to picardy , and would go and make some inquiries concerning my three companions .: 39.63
<S> one day you will be able to understand how all this is . well , then , to the king , your nephew .: 20.98
<S> d artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing .: 26.96
<S> oh , no , said kitty , it is not me you love !: 17.55
<S> but all i know , sir , is , that i am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt .: 50.82
<S> what s your pleasure , gentlemen ? replied the peasant , with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the sorbonne and the rue de l universite .: 44.57
<S> i was for twenty years cardinal spada s secretary ; i was arrested , why , i know not , toward the beginning of the year 1811 ; since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government . why from the french government ? because i was arrested at piombino , and i presume that , like milan and florence , piombino has become the capital of some french department . ah , said the inspector , you have not the latest news from italy ? my information dates from the day on which i was arrested , returned the abbe faria ; and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son , i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and c sar borgia , which was to make italy a united kingdom . monsieur , returned the inspector , providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly . it is the only means of rendering italy strong , happy , and independent . very possibly ; only i am not come to discuss politics , but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of . the food is the same as in other prisons , that is , very bad ; the lodging is very unhealthful , but , on the whole , passable for a dungeon ; but it is not that which i wish to speak of , but a secret i have to reveal of the greatest importance . we are coming to the point , whispered the governor .: 56.44
<S> there is constancy ! then turning to grimaud , he said : and thou , my brave fellow , thou consentest thus to aid me ? grimaud signified his assent .: 51.55
<S> my dear athos , i have reflected on your arguments and i am convinced .: 28.38
<S> he has slept a long time on a hard bed , so he won t object to a soft one ; take every care of him , i beg of you . charles bowed and retired .: 50.61
<S> yesterday he wrote again ; but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the post . do you say the procurator s wife is old and ugly ? fifty at least , monsieur , and not at all handsome , according to pathaud s account . in that case , you may be quite at ease ; she will soon be softened .: 53.47
<S> i am nearly thirty seven . mind , aramis d artagnan smiled as he spoke since we are together again , let us agree on one point : what age shall we be in future ? how ? formerly i was your junior by two or three years , and if i am not mistaken i am turned forty years old . indeed !: 77.72
<S> the four young men , standing and motionless , followed him with their eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared .: 22.99
<S> the second operation was as successful as the first , la jeune ame lie was in luck .: 29.56
<S> i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall , or destroy a staircase ; but i can not so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life . a slight movement of surprise escaped dante s .: 67.44
<S> by a violent effort he rose half out of the water , waving his cap , and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors .: 49.36
<S> athos s idea ! cried aramis and d artagnan , at the same time .: 18.05
<S> where do we go first ? to calais , said d artagnan ; that is the most direct line to london . well , said porthos , this is my advice speak ! four men traveling together would be suspected .: 40.33
<S> it was rita s father , who brought his daughter s ransom in person .: 31.47
<S> chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword .: 34.46
<S> the past came to him like one of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the others .: 73.11
<S> what ?: 20.58
<S> if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law .: 14.71
<S> well , beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army . oh , m. de morcerf , interrupted morrel .: 55.83
<S> oho ! said he , is the hotel on fire ? on approaching the hotel of the roe he found , however , that it was in front of the next house the mob was collected .: 50.23
<S> you are here ! said she .: 12.06
<S> egad ! cried aramis , you set me thinking .: 31.35
<S> he started , and the prisoner saw that start for though her eyes were cast down , nothing escaped her .: 83.76
<S> and you , asked porthos , haven t you still in your service your old lackey , that good , that brave , that intelligent what , then , is his name ? planchet yes , i have found him again , but he is lackey no longer . what is he , then ? with his sixteen hundred francs you remember , the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of la rochelle by carrying a letter to lord de winter he has set up a little shop in the rue des lombards and is now a confectioner . ah , he is a confectioner in the rue des lombards !: 38.19
<S> at the outer door the steward paused .: 39.06
<S> we will invoke the remembrance of that poor de winter , for whom he seemed to have a great regard ; we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is going on ; we will spend with him a guinea each per day ; and i think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed . you forget , aramis , one precaution of considerable importance . what is that ? the precaution of changing our clothes . changing our clothes ! exclaimed porthos .: 50.59
<S> winter approached .: 257.75
<S> now , as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance , as one calls his other hand to aid the first , i looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there ; for i had seen you , aramis , with the king , and you , count , i knew would be under the scaffold , and for that reason i forgive you , he added , offering athos his hand , for you must have suffered much .: 50.17
<S> as for the count , he had fallen on his chair ; it was evident that his legs refused to support him .: 13.62
<S> i thought we agreed for the price i asked . that is , replied the jeweller , i offered 40,000 francs . forty thousand , cried la carconte ; we will not part with it for that sum .: 49.04
<S> i was looking around for porthos when i saw near me a head which had been broken , but which , for better or worse , had been patched with plaster and with black silk .: 73.34
<S> towns fled from them like shadows on their path , and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them , and retreating as rapidly when once reached .: 178.51
<S> certainly ; as m. danglars says , you are rich , and perfectly free .: 52.10
<S> the effect of the present revelation was stunning ; he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy .: 59.49
<S> i do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as monsieur de la fere , replied the cardinal , bowing to athos .: 20.61
<S> you disturb me ?: 34.36
<S> ah , this visit was expected .: 29.85
<S> i was about to give it when you anticipated me . that , then , is your opinion ? asked aramis .: 16.43
<S> i was only speaking in reference to the second rate fortunes we were mentioning just now . and with all this , how unassuming he is !: 53.88
<S> the night chapter 90 .: 17.78
<S> escaped ?: 350.66
<S> d artagnan approached him , and seeing him stare so fixedly , said : well , friend !: 28.10
<S> at noon they rode into the avenue of pierrefonds .: 29.29
<S> besides , here is a piquant fricandeau and a fillet of beef . i am recruiting myself , said porthos , i am recruiting myself .: 40.79
<S> besides , what does the gospel say ?: 33.59
<S> you must be aware that for our undertaking , company would be in the way . that s true , said the guardsman , astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man .: 33.54
<S> before questioning me , he said , reply to my question .: 36.87
<S> when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near , he wished for solitude , his agitation was extreme ; a simple question from a friend would have irritated him .: 64.81
<S> as he found himself in the quarter in which aramis lived , he took it into his head to pay his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to send planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the mousetrap .: 41.66
<S> and am i not a hundred times better thus ? cried euge nie , smoothing the scattered curls of her hair , which had now quite a masculine appearance ; and do you not think me handsomer so ? oh , you are beautiful always beautiful ! cried louise .: 40.99
<S> what is the matter , maximilian ? asked he ; you are pale , and the perspiration rolls from your forehead . morrel fell into a chair .: 20.54
<S> the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message .: 29.63
<S> la ramee s mouth watered and he returned to the duke s chamber rubbing his hands .: 38.61
<S> he followed a short distance close under the wall , then crossed a path , hid entered a clump of trees .: 49.47
<S> and now , gentlemen , i repeat , excuse me , but on that account only , and on guard ! at these words , with the most gallant air possible , d artagnan drew his sword .: 23.82
<S> besides , i expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to walk . come , then , said the prince ; let us lose no time . the peasant started off , running before the prince s horse ; then , a hundred steps from the village , he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom of the valley .: 36.08
<S> the carnival was to commence on the morrow ; therefore albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes , expectations , and claims to notice .: 66.83
<S> your guest is charming , but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes .: 66.02
<S> i have only the letters of ali tepelini , which i have placed before you ; the ring , a token of his good will , which is here ; and , lastly , the most convincing proof i can offer , after an anonymous attack , and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military life . a murmur of approbation ran through the assembly ; and at this moment , albert , had nothing more transpired , your father s cause had been gained .: 58.46
<S> do not try , my lord , you can not guess who it is ; all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned .: 53.30
<S> i know something of him . but it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with him . fortune is a courtesan ; favorable yesterday , she may turn her back tomorrow . which means that you now hesitate ? no , i do not hesitate ; god forbid !: 62.16
<S> swear , by your hopes of salvation , to keep her safely for the chastisement she has merited .: 73.77
<S> yours is a pretty business . but , said the agitated mercer , do me the pleasure , monsieur , to tell me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does while i am in prison ? because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between you of an infernal plan . i swear to you , monsieur commissary , that you are in the profoundest error , that i know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do , that i am entirely a stranger to what she has done ; and that if she has committed any follies , i renounce her , i abjure her , i curse her ! bah ! said athos to the commissary , if you have no more need of me , send me somewhere .: 54.87
<S> presently a good , solid , wooden ladder was placed against the window .: 90.65
<S> it is a mixture of excellent opium , which i fetched myself from canton in order to have it pure , and the best hashish which grows in the east that is , between the tigris and the euphrates .: 56.99
<S> why did you not come down to breakfast ?: 24.83
<S> he took the papers , and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal , and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his eminence . i understand .: 27.75
<S> then , i confess , curiosity mingled with hatred ; i wished to see what villefort was going to do there , and i remained motionless , holding my breath .: 39.84
<S> the unknown day , for which dante s had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes , again dawned .: 74.07
<S> good to eat ! he said , and put it in his pocket .: 27.50
<S> these were the first tears the man of blood had ever wept .: 71.57
<S> luigi vampa s bill of fare chapter 116 .: 48.26
<S> fortune is precarious ; and if i were a woman and fate had made me a banker s wife , whatever might be my confidence in my husband s good fortune , still in speculation you know there is great risk .: 75.85
<S> danglars , who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach , arose softly , again applied his eye to the crack of the door , and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide .: 50.44
<S> at last , however , we succeeded , and worked up to arles .: 55.99
<S> but , said monte cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred ? ah , ma foi ! who is to know ? perhaps it is some political difference ? my father and the baron d e pinay lived in the stormy times of which i only saw the ending , said villefort .: 45.95
<S> i hate this life of the fashionable world , always ordered , measured , ruled , like our music paper .: 125.60
<S> his majesty king louis xiii .: 40.09
<S> blaisois , a tall , simple youth , who understood nothing but what he was expressly told , asked , therefore for the abbe d herblay , and in spite of bazin s assurances that his master was not at home , he persisted in such a manner as to put bazin into a passion .: 35.39
<S> and the royal carriage drove on , followed by the other coaches and about fifty horsemen .: 44.38
<S> they wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign , and that they might move her to compassion ; but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way , haughtily disdainful of their entreaties .: 50.86
<S> we were beginning to grow impatient , said athos .: 22.90
<S> he came down into the kitchen , where your doublet was .: 37.36
<S> thanks to the attentions of raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman , the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man , who opened his eyes , at first entirely bewildered , but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him .: 37.04
<S> oh ! he exclaimed , i begin to be more at my ease , however , whilst you settle yourselves , i shall make the round of the boat . as for me , said porthos , i will see to the supper . a very good idea , porthos , said the gascon .: 31.25
<S> in the meantime , dispose of my coachman , my carriage , and my servants . we have forgotten to mention , that the count s coachman was attired in a bear skin , exactly resembling odry s in the bear and the pasha ; and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys , with spring masks , with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed .: 91.97
<S> he tried it on his left hand ; it fit his finger as if made for it .: 65.30
<S> he meditates .: 33.13
<S> well ? said the landlord .: 14.86
<S> true , monsieur , said mousqueton ; and five hundred feet from here is a small hunting house . mousqueton , thy pistols , said d artagnan .: 38.31
<S> go and see those whom you love and who love you , and tell my sister de longueville that i thank her for the present that she made me of you . and i came , sir , added raoul , gazing at the count with a smile of real affection , for i thought you would be glad to see me again . athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow , as he would have done to a young daughter .: 30.32
<S> i thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds .: 55.49
<S> in each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses .: 116.66
<S> here they are , monseigneur . there was a moment of silence , which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note , or else in writing it .: 34.24
<S> i am doing a little sum in arithmetic . in arithmetic ? yes ; i am calculating by the way , morcerf , that indirectly concerns you i am calculating what the house of danglars must have gained by the last rise in haiti bonds ; from 206 they have risen to 409 in three days , and the prudent banker had purchased at 206 ; therefore he must have made 300,000 livres . that is not his biggest scoop , said morcerf ; did he not make a million in spaniards this last year ? my dear fellow , said lucien , here is the count of monte cristo , who will say to you , as the italians do , denaro e santita , meta della meta . 9 when they tell me such things , i only shrug my shoulders and say nothing . but you were speaking of haitians ? said monte cristo .: 73.32
<S> it seems you must always be playing some game or other . yes ; and that reminds me that i have a revenge to take .: 48.74
<S> he found the wharf too completely deserted , the night too dark , the captain too accommodating .: 103.89
<S> but your wife , monsieur , what has she to do with all this ? her devotion to the queen is known ; and they wish either to remove her from her mistress , or to intimidate her , in order to obtain her majesty s secrets , or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy . that is likely , said d artagnan ; but the man who has abducted her do you know him ? i have told you that i believe i know him . his name ? i do not know that ; what i do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal , his evil genius . but you have seen him ? yes , my wife pointed him out to me one day . has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him ? oh , certainly ; he is a noble of very lofty carriage , black hair , swarthy complexion , piercing eye , white teeth , and has a scar on his temple . a scar on his temple ! cried d artagnan ; and with that , white teeth , a piercing eye , dark complexion , black hair , and haughty carriage why , that s my man of meung . he is your man , do you say ? yes , yes ; but that has nothing to do with it .: 38.61
<S> but then he may have stopped at saint germain . i don t think so ; we appointed to meet at la chevrette . i was there this very day . and had the pretty madeleine no news ? asked aramis , smiling .: 41.90
<S> the tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the palais royal entirely .: 57.14
<S> they could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear , as they lay bound in the chamber .: 37.58
<S> father and daughter we saw in a preceding chapter how madame danglars went formally to announce to madame de villefort the approaching marriage of euge nie danglars and m. andrea cavalcanti .: 88.70
<S> mazarin returned , pale , and evidently thoughtful .: 38.29
<S> then athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin : this temporary sepulture is , he said , that of a man who was of feeble mind , yet one whose reign was full of great events ; because over this king watched the spirit of another man , even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it .: 96.68
<S> there is , then , the second point cleared up , or nearly so , said euge nie , without the least confusion , and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language ; and you appear satisfied with the explanation .: 48.16
<S> my dear host , and you , signora , said albert , in italian , excuse my apparent stupidity .: 33.26
<S> come , be frank , gentlemen , you have settled accounts with somebody !: 59.54
<S> alas , my dear friend , said faria in a resigned tone , you understand , do you not , and i need not attempt to explain to you ? edmond uttered a cry of agony , and , quite out of his senses , rushed towards the door , exclaiming , help , help ! faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him .: 22.36
<S> my mother , replied the young princess , a cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty ; he arrives from the army and has , he says , a letter to remit to you , on the part of the marechal de grammont , i think . ah ! said the queen to de winter , he is one of my faithful adherents ; but do you not observe , my dear lord , that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper ? madame , have pity on me , exclaimed de winter ; you wring my heart ! and who is this cavalier , henrietta ? asked the queen .: 30.32
<S> i ought to meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own . alas , said monte cristo , your words sear and embitter my heart , the more so as you have every reason to hate me .: 60.64
<S> i see , my lord , i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud ! very well , let us say no more about it .: 24.40
<S> what do you mean by that , you idiot ? asked d artagnan .: 8.83
<S> as she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of lord de winter , she placed herself at the table and ate .: 19.84
<S> from that time i looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose .: 83.62
<S> this is all very fine , dear aramis , murmured d artagnan .: 18.01
<S> it was ali , my nubian slave , who rendered this service to madame de villefort . was it ali , asked the count of morcerf , who rescued my son from the hands of bandits ? no , count , replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general ; in this instance i may fairly and freely accept your thanks ; but you have already tendered them , and fully discharged your debt if indeed there existed one and i feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject .: 63.68
<S> you think , then , said he , that i am taken to the cha teau d if to be imprisoned there ? it is probable ; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard . without any inquiry , without any formality ? all the formalities have been gone through ; the inquiry is already made . and so , in spite of m. de villefort s promises ? i do not know what m. de villefort promised you , said the gendarme , but i know we are taking you to the cha teau d if .: 24.51
<S> stop , said he ; i will go with you . excuse me , sir , said franz , since m. noirtier sent for me , i am ready to attend to his wish ; besides , i shall be happy to pay my respects to him , not having yet had the honor of doing so . pray , sir , said villefort with marked uneasiness , do not disturb yourself . 40032m forgive me , sir , said franz in a resolute tone .: 22.05
<S> the inquiry chapter 70 .: 42.61
<S> what the devil !: 8.64
<S> do not forget this evening do not forget that promise . be satisfied .: 45.33
<S> midnight struck slowly and sadly ; every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl .: 67.52
<S> when once in the saddle grimaud reflected on two things ; first , that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles , and secondly , that he had no money .: 83.28
<S> i arose trembling .: 103.57
<S> i staked grimaud , the silent grimaud , divided into ten portions . well , what next ? said d artagnan , laughing in spite of himself .: 42.66
<S> dante s thought , as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him , that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land .: 39.72
<S> yes , replied the old man .: 5.16
<S> i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you . i burnt it , for fear that even a fragment should remain ; for that letter must have led to your condemnation . and the destruction of your future prospects , replied noirtier ; yes , i can easily comprehend that .: 55.01
<S> but , continued d artagnan , how did you escape ? i took advantage of a moment when they left me alone ; and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction , with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window .: 35.80
<S> this , as you know , is the important point of distinction between the covenanter and the cavalier . after some discussion this was agreed to and mousqueton played the role of barber .: 98.04
<S> that knife , which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of , because he knows the use i would make of it !: 74.16
<S> but as soon as it was finished , the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing rooms ; the brilliant sums , the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people , and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young lady s diamonds , which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose , had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly .: 65.86
<S> de monte cristo ! she exclaimed ; and how is he connected with the question you asked me ? 40219m you know , mother , m. de monte cristo is almost an oriental , and it is customary with the orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies . do you say m. de monte cristo is our enemy ? replied merce de s , becoming paler than the sheet which covered her .: 41.58
<S> he hastily tore off the cover , opened the journal with nervous precipitation , passed contemptuously over the paris jottings , and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence , stopped with a malicious smile , at a paragraph headed we hear from yanina . very good , observed danglars , after having read the paragraph ; here is a little article on colonel fernand , which , if i am not mistaken , would render the explanation which the comte de morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary . at the same moment , that is , at nine o clock in the morning , albert de morcerf , dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin , might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of monte cristo s house in the champs e lyse es .: 40.79
<S> he immediately signalled it .: 57.45
<S> you here , rochefort ? he said , in a low voice .: 10.15
<S> almost instantly , in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry , seven or eight horses , excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators , passed by like lightning .: 75.82
<S> although this man was scarcely thirty six or thirty seven years of age , hair , mustaches , and royal , all began to be gray .: 34.61
<S> then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling .: 72.26
<S> what joy for my lord and master , du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds ! thou good mousqueton !: 71.56
<S> sometimes a chief is wanted , but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers .: 117.95
<S> supposing it had been thrown aside , it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate ; but this examination was as useless as the first , and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket , which now contained no hope for me . oh , cried madame danglars , it was enough to drive you mad ! i hoped for a moment that it might , said villefort ; but that happiness was denied me .: 44.74
<S> then no more of felton ; she would have cut your throat , and after that everybody else s .: 86.45
<S> you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle danglars .: 57.31
<S> all england is with cromwell ; and since you ask for my prisoners , i bend , sir , to your wishes .: 47.33
<S> gracious heavens ; another idea presents itself what if they should be his hair stood on end .: 107.08
<S> the poor girl ventured a glance at d artagnan which said , see how i suffer on your account ! toward the end of the evening , however , the beautiful lioness became milder ; she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of d artagnan , and even gave him her hand to kiss .: 47.94
<S> you have no idea what a false look you have , particularly when you are afraid .: 50.71
<S> at the end of fifteen months the level was finished , and the excavation completed beneath the gallery , and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads .: 41.60
<S> he knew the king of old , and he knew that all these complaints were but a preface a sort of excitation to encourage himself and that he had now come to his point at last .: 53.66
<S> at this very moment the court is making overtures to me ; hitherto i have repulsed them ; but since such men as you assure me that i am wrong in doing so , i ve a good mind to follow your advice and to accept a proposition made to me by the duc de chatillon just now . accept it , my lord , accept it , said aramis .: 57.49
<S> he already knew italian , and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east ; and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others , so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish , english , and german .: 56.45
<S> what did you say , sir ? asked the man .: 6.59
<S> athos collected himself , and in proportion as he did so , d artagnan saw that he became pale .: 25.32
<S> i am stricken by fate .: 46.50
<S> so the duke had more than enough to think about ; accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis ; he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game .: 125.00
<S> the cemetery of the cha teau d if on the bed , at full length , and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window , lay a sack of canvas , and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form ; it was faria s last winding sheet , a winding sheet which , as the turnkey said , cost so little .: 58.02
<S> it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance , but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time . but if you yourselves should be struck ? said athos .: 59.39
<S> at the sight of him she expected , though probably not in such a costume , the young woman started in terror , and was about to make a hasty retreat .: 42.12
<S> meantime , he was going to try to find out milady .: 30.76
<S> are you sent by general oliver cromwell , the most illustrious captain of the age ? i have this instant left him , replied mordaunt , alighting , in order to give his horse to a soldier to hold .: 42.62
<S> grimaud rose .: 23.37
<S> then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful mistress .: 52.55
<S> devil take the vain fellow , said d artagnan .: 15.93
<S> one of them took his gun by the barrel , and used it as he would a club .: 34.31
<S> would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt ?: 81.24
<S> the pharaon !: 29.28
<S> holloa , there , some bread ! he called .: 103.58
<S> the porter was drawing the cord at the moment milady cried from her window , don t open ! the young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent gesture .: 72.80
<S> alight , planchet , and inquire , for i confess that i have scarcely courage so to do . planchet alighted .: 72.88
<S> in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters , but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long pointed knife , whose temper he well knew , and which was never absent from him .: 85.45
<S> it is past noon , said she , and today is saturday ; i dare say it is the doctor , grandpapa . noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition .: 39.64
<S> the noble carriage of this gentleman , for whom he believed himself to be engaged , had won planchet that was the name of the picard .: 53.97
<S> every instant mme .: 59.30
<S> he now saw where the breastplate was weak , and prepared the blow .: 70.03
<S> they were parting to meet again when it pleased god , and if it pleased god .: 109.12
<S> i hate you all , but not equally .: 77.76
<S> raoul , his hat in ribbons , his face bleeding , felt not only his strength but also his reason going ; a red mist covered his sight , and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him , ready to seize upon him when he fell .: 100.22
<S> in vain did franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him ; in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep .: 84.71
<S> let us be on our guard . oh !: 20.21
<S> it is even probable that i shall have to make a journey .: 22.66
<S> poor concino concini !: 117.98
<S> this time the marshal charged , but he was welcomed by musket shots , while stones fell like hail from all the windows .: 121.08
<S> mazarin , after this half humble , half gallant attention , went away .: 101.54
<S> captivity : the fifth day chapter lvii .: 42.56
<S> deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between vieille chapelle and la venthie ; and after a reconnoissance along the entire line , in company with marshal de grammont , he had returned and seated himself before a table , with his officers around him .: 98.09
<S> i am of a frankness of character quite french . rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile .: 50.17
<S> the eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water , and the boat , yielding to the impulsion , glided forward .: 39.83
<S> to be named the just you are right , tre ville ; but they were not alone , your musketeers .: 47.66
<S> dante s drew back , and gazed on the abbe with a sensation almost amounting to terror .: 29.77
<S> never more to be separated ? why , as to that i think , my dear son , you must be by this time so accustomed to france as to look upon it almost as a second country . the fact is , said the young man , that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it . as for me , you must know i can not possibly live out of lucca ; therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can . but before you leave france , my dear father , i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent . certainly ; i am come expressly on that account ; it has cost me much trouble to find you , but i had resolved on giving them into your hands , and if i had to recommence my search , it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life . where are these papers , then ? here they are . andrea seized the certificate of his father s marriage and his own baptismal register , and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances , he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents , and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents .: 39.27
<S> charles listened with marked attention , passing over the insults , noting the grievances , and , when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand , replying with a smile of lofty scorn .: 158.56
<S> in six hours they reached compiegne and alighted at the peacock .: 39.14
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> that s his province . ay , ay ! said porthos ; pass the pen to aramis , who writes theses in latin . well , so be it , said d artagnan .: 29.61
<S> i am commandant of the port .: 29.40
<S> but this time our gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be derived from the love which kitty had just confessed so innocently , or so boldly : the interception of letters addressed to the comte de wardes , news on the spot , entrance at all hours into kitty s chamber , which was contiguous to her mistress s .: 76.49
<S> and now , whenever he wishes well , whenever he wishes ? planchet began to sing : un vent de fronde s est leve ce matin ; je crois qu il gronde contre le mazarin .: 126.33
<S> porthos ! murmured the comte de la fere .: 13.58
<S> i acknowledge it affected me , and , indeed , all the committee also , said beauchamp .: 50.39
<S> the carriage , which had been stopped for a minute , resumed its way , passed through the crowd , threaded the rue st. honore , turned into the rue des bons enfants , and stopped before a low door .: 30.47
<S> oh , i am guilty , then ; you will not pardon me ? the monk recovered his usual expression .: 26.44
<S> he knew that athos not only never drank , but more , that he had a kind of repugnance to wine .: 41.73
<S> if his heart is free , and he will marry hayde e , the daughter of ali pasha of yanina , whom i have brought up with the love of a father , and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me , he will thus accomplish my last wish .: 31.09
<S> arrived here only yesterday morning , and married today at three o clock !: 79.07
<S> on looking around him , however , as he could perceive no threatening object , as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger , as the bench was comfortably covered with a well stuffed cushion , as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather , and as large red damask curtains , fastened back by gold clasps , floated before the window , he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated , and he began to turn his head to the right and the left , upward and downward .: 76.12
<S> he questioned him , and as the boy had no interest in deceiving , d artagnan learned that he exercised , from six o clock in the morning until nine , the office of chorister , and from nine o clock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern .: 43.91
<S> when the chill of the night had driven away the guests from the gardens , and the gates of the villa were closed on them for the festa in doors , he took teresa quite away , and as he left her at her home , he said : teresa , what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young countess of san felice ? i thought , replied the young girl , with all the frankness of her nature , that i would give half my life for a costume such as she wore . and what said your cavalier to you ? he said it only depended on myself to have it , and i had only one word to say . he was right , said luigi .: 50.59
<S> climb up , said he to dante s .: 26.67
<S> one day , benedetto , who had been gone from the house since morning , to our great anxiety , did not return until late in the evening , dragging a monkey after him , which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree .: 47.59
<S> i am at home here , and i alone have a right to raise my voice above another s .: 33.74
<S> repudiated by her husband , said athos .: 35.49
<S> and you , you , d artagnan , a man sprung from the ancient nobility of france , bearing an honorable name , carrying a good sword , have helped to give up a king to beersellers , shopkeepers , and wagoners .: 50.97
<S> you can not imagine , mother , how beautiful i think you ! said the young man , impressed with a profound feeling of filial love .: 32.64
<S> caderousse s knife , dark lantern , bunch of keys , and clothing , excepting the waistcoat , which could not be found , were deposited at the registry ; the corpse was conveyed to the morgue .: 55.76
<S> it was just before this that grimaud had perceived the two men seated together .: 46.12
<S> we have arrested monsieur de beaufort , but he is the least dangerous among them .: 29.24
<S> what ?: 20.58
<S> when we parted at the pont du var , you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany ; but instead of that , you come to paris . how does that annoy you ? it does not ; on the contrary , i think it will answer my purpose . so , said andrea , you are speculating upon me ? what fine words he uses ! i warn you , master caderousse , that you are mistaken . well , well , don t be angry , my boy ; you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate ; and misfortunes make us jealous .: 40.04
<S> the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo , and we will go another ; and , if you please , by the corso .: 23.23
<S> the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep , or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours ; it was then , in the silence of night , in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney piece , that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness , and fan the fever with their trembling wings .: 92.06
<S> and you approve of what she said that is to say , you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts ? yes . it was you who sent for me ? yes . to make your will ? yes . and you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions ? the old man winked violently .: 35.16
<S> d artagnan picked it up and offered it to lord de winter .: 15.25
<S> suppose , for instance , the prisoner , as is more than probable , to have served under napoleon well , can you expect for an instant , that one accustomed , at the word of his commander , to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe , will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy , than to slaughter his fellow creatures , merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey ?: 79.82
<S> all the world has not the secret of the medicis or the borgias . now , replied the count , shrugging his shoulders , shall i tell you the cause of all these stupidities ?: 24.59
<S> keeping along the shore , and examining the smallest object with serious attention , he thought he could trace , on certain rocks , marks made by the hand of man .: 106.64
<S> i repeat it , d artagnan , you are the best one among us ; i bless and love you , my dear son . and to think that i couldn t find that out , said porthos , scratching his head ; it is so simple . but , said aramis , if i understand rightly we are to kill them all , eh ? athos shuddered and turned pale .: 35.10
<S> art thou dumb ? cried the duke .: 30.24
<S> only , d artagnan , if you have not lost it , give me the paper which fell from that man s hat , upon which is written the name of the village of ah , said d artagnan , i comprehend !: 30.05
<S> do not copy , display , perform , distribute or redistribute this electronic work , or any part of this electronic work , without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.e.1 with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the project gutenberg license .: 16.33
<S> athos smiled when he saw their bare swords ; he felt it was no longer to be a butchery , but a fight , and he resumed his usual good humor .: 39.63
<S> you offered me hospitality , and i accept it , and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof . caderousse stammered out something , while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow .: 56.88
<S> indeed ! does that alarm you ? no , but it agitates me . oh !: 45.82
<S> lord de winter did the same .: 13.28
<S> it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed , but villefort s was one of those that never close , or if they do , only close to reopen more agonizing than ever .: 89.94
<S> in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes gigantic cabbages walk gravely about , buffaloes heads bellow from men s shoulders , dogs walk on their hind legs ; in the midst of all this a mask is lifted , and , as in callot s temptation of st. anthony , a lovely face is exhibited , which we would fain follow , but from which we are separated by troops of fiends .: 175.41
<S> the bird on the branch , the dog in his kennel , the sheep in the field , the boats moored in the loire , even , became alive and vocal .: 103.43
<S> but , said morrel , i thought this mixture , of which you now take four spoonfuls , was prepared for m. noirtier ? i know it is very bitter , said valentine ; so bitter , that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste . noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter .: 54.96
<S> ah ! continued the count , be good enough to ask pastrini if he has received the tavoletta , and if he can send us an account of the execution . there is no need to do that , said franz , taking out his tablets ; for i saw the account , and copied it down . very well , you can retire , m. bertuccio ; i need you no longer .: 32.60
<S> you persist in your incredulity , edmond , continued faria .: 35.02
<S> how do you think these garments fit me ? wonderfully , said d artagnan ; but i come to offer you a dress which will become you still better . what ? asked porthos .: 32.46
<S> and he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers , who read and returned it to him .: 34.49
<S> they had not mistaken the gravity of this event , for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles , julie saw the latter leave it pale , trembling , and his features betraying the utmost consternation .: 63.53
<S> the cardinal was lavish to his underlings . yes , yes , guitant , said mazarin ; richelieu was a great man , a very great man , but he had that defect .: 31.71
<S> no one ever asked her where she was going .: 35.07
<S> they were rapidly leaving the cha teau d if behind .: 44.01
<S> we have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door , and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared .: 45.35
<S> the darkness lasted two hours longer ; then by degrees a cold light crept through the venetian blinds , until at length it revealed the objects in the room .: 63.65
<S> the coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed ; only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen .: 65.66
<S> as a punishment for having spoken without permission , my friend , you will please to eat this piece of paper ; then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us , you shall afterward drink this glass of wine .: 62.59
<S> on the contrary , that simplifies the matter greatly .: 36.29
<S> as you pass the lodge , wake the porter , and send him for a surgeon . ali obeyed , leaving the abbe alone with caderousse , who had not yet revived .: 53.49
<S> at last , in an hour after the scene we have just described , she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the door .: 24.71
<S> if you can be satisfied with my dinner it consists of cooked tetragones and fruits . what do you mean by tetragones ? asked d artagnan , uneasily .: 31.90
<S> it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory .: 103.52
<S> we will accept them the more readily , since we have them not here ; you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the alle es de meilhan , at marseilles .: 26.93
<S> in his arms he held the child , whom no skill had been able to recall to life .: 39.40
<S> and what makes me all the more wretched , sir , is , that i was the cause of this misfortune . how so ? asked athos .: 25.13
<S> troops ? five or six thousand men . courage ? plenty . then the thing is easy .: 107.55
<S> the papers had related his various adventures , both as the man of fashion and the galley slave ; and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with prince andrea cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate , they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of m. benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains .: 99.37
<S> you tell me of m. franz d e pinay , your betrothed lover , and you shrink from the idea of being his wife ; but tell me , valentine , is there no other sorrow in your heart ?: 27.06
<S> but m. de tre ville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years a novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for d artagnan to render the king any signal service , or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action .: 95.13
<S> remain , parry .: 71.21
<S> villefort burst it open with a violent blow .: 52.16
<S> she must have a long arm . hush ! said porthos , placing a finger on his lips .: 16.79
<S> mr .: 92.47
<S> i approached the jeweller , who was not quite dead , and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor , he opened his eyes , fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze , moved his lips as though trying to speak , then , overcome by the effort , fell back and expired .: 33.55
<S> in the position in which raoul lay , unfortunately , he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard , nor his pistols from their holsters .: 53.79
<S> listen to me , he said , or , rather , look upon me ; look at my face , paler even than usual , and my eyes , red with weariness for four days i have not closed them , for i have been constantly watching you , to protect and preserve you for maximilian . the blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of valentine , for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her .: 59.53
<S> how did you obtain these details ? sire , they are the results of an examination which i have made of a man of marseilles , whom i have watched for some time , and arrested on the day of my departure .: 27.99
<S> the ball fired by porthos s foe went through the throat of his horse , which fell , groaning .: 56.32
<S> this letter is here , in this pocket , and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter .: 29.16
<S> his eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past , of times present , and probably of times to come .: 114.84
<S> m. bertuccio , lay covers for three . he then took franz s tablets out of his hand .: 49.46
<S> besides , if they do , we can easily make an excuse ; we came straight off a journey and are insurgents , too . an excuse for us !: 71.43
<S> i should like to have seen his face at that moment . that would have been difficult . no matter , replied de boville , in supreme good humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francs , no matter , i can fancy it . and he shouted with laughter .: 40.29
<S> what say you , franz ? oh , i agree with you ; the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me . the truth was , that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin , in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal ; and if this muffled up individual proved as franz felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina , then he should be able to establish his identity , and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom .: 53.55
<S> no , replied the count , carelessly ; for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name , for peppino , called rocca priori .: 40.74
<S> and you say he is dressed as a monk , grimaud ? yes , as an augustine monk . what sized man is he ? about my height ; thin , pale , with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair . and he did not see raoul ? asked athos .: 56.25
<S> in life , our greatest preoccupation is death ; is it not then , curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part ; and how , according to their different characters , temperaments , and even the different customs of their countries , different persons bear the transition from life to death , from existence to annihilation ?: 77.78
<S> the particular characteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired during its continuance .: 131.30
<S> every one nowadays wants auxiliaries ; propositions have been made to me and i confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out . monsieur de gondy !: 49.87
<S> had she betrayed him ?: 45.27
<S> your betrothed , valentine de villefort . p.s . my poor grandmother gets worse and worse ; yesterday her fever amounted to delirium ; today her delirium is almost madness .: 210.80
<S> u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff .: 93.72
<S> we have still fifteen days before us , said he to his friends , well , if at the end of a fortnight i have found nothing , or rather if nothing has come to find me , as i , too good a catholic to kill myself with a pistol bullet , i will seek a good quarrel with four of his eminence s guards or with eight englishmen , and i will fight until one of them has killed me , which , considering the number , can not fail to happen .: 49.89
<S> i was taken to the slave market , and was purchased by a rich armenian .: 46.23
<S> oh , curses , woe , death to you ! he tried to follow monte cristo ; but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the spot , his eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets ; he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with blood ; the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary , and deluge his brain with living fire .: 63.67
<S> i not only promise , but swear it ! said monte cristo extending his hand .: 25.81
<S> he arose , paced a while up and down the hut , and then , suddenly stopping before merce de s , with his eyes glowing and his hands clenched , say , merce de s , he said , once for all , is this your final determination ? i love edmond dante s , the young girl calmly replied , and none but edmond shall ever be my husband . and you will always love him ? as long as i live . fernand let fall his head like a defeated man , heaved a sigh that was like a groan , and then suddenly looking her full in the face , with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils , said , but if he is dead if he is dead , i shall die too . if he has forgotten you merce de s ! called a joyous voice from without , merce de s ! ah , exclaimed the young girl , blushing with delight , and fairly leaping in excess of love , you see he has not forgotten me , for here he is ! and rushing towards the door , she opened it , saying , here , edmond , here i am ! fernand , pale and trembling , drew back , like a traveller at the sight of a serpent , and fell into a chair beside him .: 48.99
<S> as the eleventh hour struck , he entered with a swaggering air , attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions .: 48.05
<S> the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame danglars into her box , the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half hour s interval allowed between the acts , and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies , or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes .: 90.69
<S> there was a moment s silence .: 6.23
<S> to do justice to them who had condemned me , they kept their word .: 46.45
<S> if i am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman . a gentleman ! exclaimed athos .: 16.89
<S> it was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to danglars to invest ; some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future father in law , who had of late sustained repeated losses ; but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen , or to express a single doubt to the baron .: 69.20
<S> ah , you are there , said she , at length , turning towards fernand .: 18.26
<S> capital ! exclaimed the gascon .: 18.40
<S> my lord bishop , he cried , seizing juxon s hands , where is providence ?: 40.26
<S> he seemed quite overcome by my misfortune . by your misfortune ? yes . then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored ? he gave me one great proof of his sympathy , at any rate . and that ? he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me . what ?: 81.04
<S> beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met monte cristo , who was directing his steps towards the rue de la chausse e d antin , to m. danglars .: 25.50
<S> from the top of an eminence d artagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat , in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward saint maur .: 51.91
<S> yes , indicated the old man .: 14.48
<S> come , come , tre ville , hold your tongue , said the king .: 9.49
<S> tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator , and muscular as a spartan , he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps , actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken .: 53.89
<S> for a time the delightful remembrance of madame bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge , perishable indeed ; for like all other recollections in this world , these impressions were , by degrees , effaced .: 103.02
<S> therefore , in my opinion , my dear baron , the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies , and allow them to act as they please , and then , if any mischief follows , why , at least , they have no one to blame but themselves . danglars made no reply ; he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness , whose frowning brow , like that of olympic jove , predicted a storm .: 57.08
<S> your affair is not bad , said athos , after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good ; and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man .: 64.39
<S> debray , instead of answering , allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous inquiry .: 29.35
<S> nine days after leaving the charente , pale with fatigue and vexation , milady saw only the blue coasts of finisterre appear .: 92.53
<S> i knew you were a corsican .: 24.87
<S> is the officer referred to a relation of yours , then ? demanded the journalist .: 46.63
<S> in about the space of a second a private door opened , and ali appeared , bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia .: 65.74
<S> let s fly the feather before the wind ; let us join with that side to which the wind will carry it and resume our adventurous life .: 85.59
<S> well , that has happened , friend porthos .: 26.16
<S> it is different with my mother , who paints exceedingly well , and who , unwilling to part with so valuable a picture , gave it to me to put here , where it would be less likely to displease m. de morcerf , whose portrait , by gros , i will also show you .: 54.47
<S> eleven o clock sounded from all the clocks of the faubourg st. germain .: 33.77
<S> i have heard monsieur d artagnan spoken of as a very brave young man , said the citizen ; and this reputation which he justly enjoys had decided me to confide a secret to him . speak , monsieur , speak , said d artagnan , who instinctively scented something advantageous .: 54.64
<S> they disobeyed orders . i beg of your majesty , then , said athos , calmly and not replying to mazarin , to quash these arrests of messieurs d artagnan and du vallon . what you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern me , said the queen .: 48.04
<S> i knew a lord wilmore , who was constantly doing actions of this kind . without revealing himself ? he was an eccentric being , and did not believe in the existence of gratitude . oh , heaven , exclaimed julie , clasping her hands , in what did he believe , then ? 30047m he did not credit it at the period which i knew him , said monte cristo , touched to the heart by the accents of julie s voice ; but , perhaps , since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist . and do you know this gentleman , monsieur ? inquired emmanuel .: 45.52
<S> now in the army , from the division generals who desire the death of the general in chief , to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals , all desire some one s death .: 79.38
<S> it has been made up a long time , said gondy .: 14.63
<S> he had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later louis xiv .: 30.11
<S> mordaunt , in fact , while defending himself , had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which cromwell had left , had felt for the knob with his left hand , pressed it and disappeared .: 54.32
<S> on my side i have two sure men , who have been in action with my father .: 45.19
<S> i see him ! the brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole , and had discovered andrea in a posture of entreaty .: 39.02
<S> the bed , which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded , burned her like a bed of fire .: 71.04
<S> how happy i am ! at this word she , athos , who had seated himself quietly , started up .: 44.25
<S> now , my dear friend , look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monk of a man who resembles an echo repeating simply what he hears .: 54.96
<S> the city , notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor , had attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender ; the mayor had hanged the mutineers .: 88.01
<S> in an instant , and as the moon broke from behind a cloud , they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who , on perceiving them , stopped in their turn , appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back .: 33.37
<S> yes , monsieur , replied the terrified citizen , in a tone so low that he was scarcely audible .: 18.24
<S> they were very happy .: 25.36
<S> i foresee in it the aid of powerful princes . with the enmity of the government . counteracted by parliament and insurrections . that may be done if they can separate the king from his mother . that may be done , said aramis .: 60.72
<S> he then returned to paris , and although in the same carriage with cha teau renaud and albert , he did not hear one word of their conversation .: 19.05
<S> madame de saint me ran a gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of m. de villefort .: 23.22
<S> to his friends m. de villefort was a powerful protector ; to his enemies , he was a silent , but bitter opponent ; for those who were neither the one nor the other , he was a statue of the law made man .: 63.14
<S> come , this is no longer our home ! the words died away , the steps were lost in the distance .: 43.17
<S> sir , said d avrigny to villefort , call mademoiselle valentine s maid , if you please . villefort went himself to find her ; and d avrigny approached noirtier .: 22.63
<S> stay with grandpapa , maximilian ; i promise you not to persuade them to stay . 40274m morrel watched her as she left the room ; he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to madame de villefort s apartments and to hers .: 51.51
<S> picture to yourself a pretty coach house at the right hand side where the ladders are kept .: 124.44
<S> as he saw the abbe rise from his seat and go towards the door , as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey , caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning .: 35.77
<S> your holiness ! said gondy ; my friend , you take me for some one else . no , your holiness , i take you for what you are , that is to say , the coadjutor ; i recognized you at the first glance . gondy smiled .: 28.30
<S> i think the arm will make up for the sword . halt ! cried porthos coming forward .: 46.80
<S> no , i have good luck , that is all .: 17.51
<S> now for the tally ho . athos threw himself into d artagnan s arms .: 48.23
<S> open ; it is i. but notwithstanding this request , notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered , the door remained closed .: 65.87
<S> talk only by gestures , or rather always listen . yes , monsieur , replied raoul .: 54.34
<S> mousqueton , who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau , wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner .: 27.56
<S> teresa , said luigi , yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the count s daughter . yes , replied teresa with astonishment ; but i was mad to utter such a wish . and i replied , very well , you shall have it . yes , replied the young girl , whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by luigi , but of course your reply was only to please me . i have promised no more than i have given you , teresa , said luigi proudly .: 46.11

<S> then i should become simply no .: 127.74
<S> nothing is lost , then . and now , madame , till i see you again !: 25.80

<S> i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty , i will be most inflexibly severe ; then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed , which seemed to say , fear not , for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy , and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return , villefort departed with paradise in his heart .: 69.77

<S> will you come ? said he to porthos .: 12.81
<S> no , replied morcerf , my father is most anxious about it ; and i hope , ere long , to introduce you , if not to my wife , at least to my betrothed mademoiselle euge nie danglars . euge nie danglars , said monte cristo ; tell me , is not her father baron danglars ? yes , returned morcerf , a baron of a new creation . what matter , said monte cristo if he has rendered the state services which merit this distinction ? enormous ones , answered beauchamp .: 46.40

<S> in fact , said athos , this delay is not natural ; they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did . add to that d artagnan s rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour , knowing that we were expecting him . he expected , you will remember , to be here on the fifth . and here we are at the ninth .: 51.72

<S> oh , no , your excellency , he is not the devil , replied the host , with a grin of contempt ; for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns which however , did not prevent his saying , as he was fainting , that if such a thing had happened in paris , you should have cause to repent of it at a later period . then , said the stranger coolly , he must be some prince in disguise . i have told you this , good sir , resumed the host , in order that you may be on your guard . did he name no one in his passion ? yes ; he struck his pocket and said , we shall see what monsieur de tre ville will think of this insult offered to his prote ge . monsieur de tre ville ? said the stranger , becoming attentive , he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tre ville ?: 42.34

<S> patience , said athos , whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the rue du bac , patience ; i see an abbe cuffing a man , then bowing to a woman ; it must be aramis . it was indeed aramis .: 38.61
<S> in the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of caderousse , who was discovered in some distant country , and brought back to france , where he made a full confession , refusing to make the fact of his wife s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt .: 88.33
<S> felton , my brother , my friend , i conjure you ! no , cried felton , no ; you shall live and you shall be avenged . felton , i bring misfortune to all who surround me !: 33.43
<S> we were once four valiant knights four hearts fondly united ; let us unite again , not our hearts , which have never been severed , but our courage and our fortunes .: 134.18
<S> then it grew nearer , and it seemed to her , almost at the same time , that she heard the neighing of horses .: 32.14
<S> the sun was in its zenith , and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor .: 47.90
<S> the attack which has just passed away , condemns me forever to the walls of a prison .: 55.01
<S> debray , with the air of a man familiar with the house , entered first into the court , threw his bridle into the hands of a footman , and returned to the door to receive madame danglars , to whom he offered his arm , to conduct her to her apartments .: 26.32
<S> but for the moment , let us do as did the amorous gascon ; we will see after the worthy mercer later .: 69.94
<S> people die very suddenly in your house , m. de villefort . what ? cried the magistrate , with an accent of horror and consternation , are you still harping on that terrible idea ? still , sir ; and i shall always do so , replied d avrigny , for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind ; and that you may be quite sure i am not mistaken this time , listen well to what i am going to say , m. de villefort . the magistrate trembled convulsively .: 35.34
<S> he however kept a good countenance , holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his eminence , without too much assurance , but also without too much humility .: 61.54
<S> morrel had thought of danglars , who was now immensely rich , and had lain under great obligations to morrel in former days , since to him it was owing that danglars entered the service of the spanish banker , with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth .: 54.99
<S> mordaunt , said the cardinal , raising his voice , as if to arouse the dreamer , my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to general cromwell if i am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one ; go , therefore , and await it at boulogne sur mer , and promise me to set out to morrow morning . i promise , my lord , replied mordaunt ; but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply ? if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave . mordaunt bowed .: 40.87
<S> and after this reasoning she slept easily .: 188.82
<S> peppino was a handsome young man of four or five and twenty , bronzed by the sun ; he carried his head erect , and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear .: 48.41
<S> is that not true , monsieur bonacieux ?: 25.76
<S> the return chapter xxix .: 26.00
<S> come , said monte cristo , touching his shoulder with his finger , are you a man again , maximilian ? yes ; for i begin to suffer again . the count frowned , apparently in gloomy hesitation .: 31.31
<S> allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the baron de chantal ; that the baron de chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen months old , and that this little girl was afterward mme .: 116.37
<S> a double movement of the globe he inhabited , and of which he could feel nothing , appeared to him perfectly impossible .: 41.55
<S> one day , when , contrary to his custom , he had admitted merce de s , and the poor girl , in spite of her own grief and despair , endeavored to console him , he said to her , be assured , my dear daughter , he is dead ; and instead of expecting him , it is he who is awaiting us ; i am quite happy , for i am the oldest , and of course shall see him first . however well disposed a person may be , why , you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow , they make one melancholy ; and so at last old dante s was left all to himself , and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide ; but i guessed what these bundles were , and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence .: 51.88
<S> besides , courage was out of the question here ; d artagnan had fallen into an ambush .: 59.88
<S> but one of these balls , launched by porthos herculean hand , passed so close to d artagnan s face that he thought that if , instead of passing near , it had hit him , his audience would have been probably lost , as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king .: 50.14
<S> you do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the king s service . d artagnan colored .: 76.75
<S> it was very natural , he being the only person in the whole assemblage , except the king , the queen , and the duke of orleans , who slept gratuitously .: 32.74
<S> well , then , off to the nearest goldsmith s , and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him .: 51.18
<S> it may still be possible to overtake the prisoner .: 31.15
<S> ah , my dear aramis , this time i shall find you out . and d artagnan , making himself as small as he could , concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche .: 35.67
<S> bassompierre and schomberg were marshals of france , and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king ; but the cardinal , who feared that bassompierre , a huguenot at heart , might press but feebly the english and rochellais , his brothers in religion , supported the duc d angoule me , whom the king , at his instigation , had named lieutenant general .: 66.09
<S> well , monsieur de busigny , i will bet you , said athos , that my three companions , messieurs porthos , aramis , and d artagnan , and myself , will go and breakfast in the bastion st. gervais , and we will remain there an hour , by the watch , whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us . porthos and aramis looked at each other ; they began to comprehend .: 26.68
<S> it seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past , and not to anticipate the future .: 31.09
<S> no , no , i would rather die ! cried the queen , in whom the imperious blood of spain and austria began to rise .: 28.78
<S> the devil thou dost not !: 47.24
<S> it appears , sir , that this edmond dante s had procured tools , or made them , for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another . this tunnel was dug , no doubt , with an intention of escape ? no doubt ; but unfortunately for the prisoners , the abbe faria had an attack of catalepsy , and died . that must have cut short the projects of escape . for the dead man , yes , replied m. de boville , but not for the survivor ; on the contrary , this dante s saw a means of accelerating his escape .: 66.55
<S> i really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self examination ; let us drop the subject , and adopt the middle course of delay , which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement .: 96.82
<S> he said nothing ; he only girded on his sword , wrapped himself in his cloak , and went straight to buckingham palace .: 35.53
<S> what was the other day a crime is today a title to favor .: 103.18
<S> come , laporte , said the queen .: 8.30
<S> precept something , but example more .: 341.08
<S> the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them ; it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor pastrini .: 52.12
<S> my dear friend , said the cardinal , leaning , as they walked through the garden , on his friend s arm , you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queen s service . yes , it s true .: 15.94
<S> but as regards your wish to visit our fine city , my dear count , i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please . then it is settled , said the count , and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated . franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo , and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely , hoping to read something of his purpose in his face , but his countenance was inscrutable especially when , as in the present case , it was veiled in a sphinx like smile .: 51.92
<S> an opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired , and money to be gained ; and as a far higher encouragement , it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he adored .: 73.33
<S> d artagnan would have remonstrated at this ; but athos put his hand upon his shoulder , with a smile , and d artagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain , but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince .: 35.29
<S> we did not see her , monseigneur , said athos .: 11.83
<S> on the morning of the eighth day , bazin , fresh as ever , and smiling , according to custom , entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast , saying , as had been agreed upon : monsieur aramis , the answer from your cousin . the four friends exchanged a joyful glance ; half of the work was done .: 53.43
<S> hunger made viands once repugnant , now acceptable ; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time , and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat , of tainted fish , of black and mouldy bread .: 150.54
<S> the mind can see as well as the body .: 41.80
<S> besides , remember that alexander was lame and hannibal had but one eye . do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party ? asked d artagnan .: 67.80
<S> oh , said he , this is very nice weather , and two leagues to go in such a storm . remain , said caderousse .: 34.72
<S> porthos came up behind , and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room .: 74.11
<S> what i can not tell , something wonderful , an absurdity , a miracle , of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call hope .: 165.86
<S> who goes there ? cried he , as soon as he perceived the horsemen .: 17.95
<S> in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature , though drawn from the most vigorous sources , abandoned her ; she sank into a large easy chair , with her arms crossed , her head lowered , and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her .: 49.72
<S> fortunately we have the great cardinal ; his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart . bonacieux was repeating , word for word , a sentence which he had heard from the comte de rochefort ; but the poor wife , who had reckoned on her husband , and who , in that hope , had answered for him to the queen , did not tremble the less , both at the danger into which she had nearly cast herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced .: 69.03
<S> i will pay twenty five piastres for my passage back to leghorn .: 47.60
<S> cocles remained in m. morrel s service , and a most singular change had taken place in his position ; he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier , and sunk to the rank of a servant .: 35.20
<S> is it possible , said he , that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it ? tell me , replied faria , what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead , dressing yourself in his clothes , and endeavoring to escape ? simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me , answered dante s .: 53.94
<S> why , said he , does not the emperor , who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war , organize a regiment of lawyers , judges and legal practitioners , sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain , and using them to save better men ? you see , my dear , that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party .: 107.70
<S> then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of franche comte .: 307.76
<S> milady concealed her face in her hands , as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her .: 29.22
<S> what a splendid business that last case of yours was , my dear villefort ! remarked a third ; i mean the trial of the man for murdering his father .: 93.35
<S> the fowl pecked at the rabbit , and the next day was a dead hen .: 36.57
<S> she has always been opposed to this marriage , and i should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them . madame , said villefort , believe me , a fortune of 900,000 francs is not so easily renounced . she could , nevertheless , make up her mind to renounce the world , sir , since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent . never mind , replied villefort ; i say that this marriage shall be consummated . notwithstanding your father s wishes to the contrary ? said madame de villefort , selecting a new point of attack .: 44.76
<S> the reputation of being out of his mind , though harmlessly and even amusingly so , had procured for the abbe unusual privileges .: 125.79
<S> how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution !: 32.08
<S> nevertheless , d artagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage .: 17.53
<S> you are not willing that i should kill my body , and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my soul . but i repeat it again to you , replied felton , in great emotion , no danger threatens you ; i will answer for lord de winter as for myself . dunce , cried milady , dunce !: 40.17
<S> lieutenant ? asked aramis .: 31.07
<S> but then you yourself are known to others ? yes , i am known , so that proceed , my dear monsieur cavalcanti . so that you will remit to me these 48,000 francs ? certainly , at your first request . the major s eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment .: 50.40
<S> he glanced mechanically towards the piazza the scene was wholly changed ; scaffold , executioners , victims , all had disappeared ; only the people remained , full of noise and excitement .: 123.77
<S> these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon ; well , monsieur de montbazon is the husband of madame de montbazon and and madame de montbazon is the mistress of the duc de beaufort . ah !: 20.66
<S> you see you were deceived , murmured the magistrate ; come and see her , and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her . each time you have applied to me , said the doctor , it has been too late ; still i will go .: 45.34
<S> would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of porthos , the exploits of our youth ? do you propose to me to do so , d artagnan ? decidedly and honestly . on whose side ? asked athos , fixing his clear , benevolent glance on the countenance of the gascon .: 40.57
<S> am i am i , then , to sleep on the floor ? asked gaston d orleans , with a forced smile .: 34.80
<S> bring hither that horse . friquet heard perfectly , but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road .: 81.20
<S> anne of austria believed that louis xiii .: 18.45
<S> is she not free to love whomsoever she will ? oh , if you take it in that sense , said caderousse , it is another thing .: 32.67
<S> what do i say ?: 8.37
<S> i inherit my father s name , and i do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it .: 35.26
<S> can porthos have negotiated for it with the duc de longueville ? faith ! exclaimed planchet , here s land in good condition ; if it belongs to monsieur porthos i wish him joy . zounds ! cried d artagnan , don t call him porthos , nor even vallon ; call him de bracieux or de pierrefonds ; thou wilt knell out damnation to my mission otherwise . as he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye , d artagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend dwelt ; the towers , though solid and as if built yesterday , were open and broken .: 79.88
<S> the coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man .: 28.05
<S> i never meddle in intrigues , and if i occasionally become a confidant of the intrigues of others i am sure your eminence will approve of my keeping them secret . mazarin shook his head .: 62.51
<S> i know he is a gascon , reflected he , but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me .: 28.47
<S> he then laid him down on the floor , where d artagnan , after giving him just time enough to draw his breath , gagged him with his long scarf ; and the moment he had done so began to undress him with the promptitude and dexterity of a man who had learned his business on the field of battle .: 35.50
<S> do you hear the guns , pray ?: 35.38
<S> you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg works .: 21.56
<S> there he is , attending mass , in the chapel of the virgin . d artagnan nearly jumped for joy ; he had despaired of finding bazin , but now , he thought , since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other end .: 71.34
<S> so , my dear aramis , say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to destiny . zounds !: 48.30
<S> he determined to make two cardinals . by choosing two of the greatest personages of rome , especially rich men this was the return the holy father looked for .: 138.41
<S> whence have you these ideas of death ? you do not suppose that , publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre , in the presence of your friends and those of your son challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory you do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live .: 70.85
<S> and yet , as he journeyed along , a profound sadness weighed upon his heart .: 44.30
<S> they then came to a massive door , which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him , turned heavily upon its hinges , and disclosed the chamber destined for milady .: 53.61
<S> ah , s blood , how you have hurt me !: 44.59
<S> you are alone , one alone shall answer you ; you have a sword by your side , i have one in my cane ; you have no witness , one of these gentlemen will serve you .: 50.62
<S> but this is , indeed , civil war which you propose to me , dear aramis . war for the king . yet the king will be at the head of the army on mazarin s side . but his heart will be in the army commanded by the duc de beaufort . monsieur de beaufort ?: 36.04
<S> a propos of the cardinal , monsieur de tre ville , i am vexed with you ! this was the chance at which m. de tre ville waited for the king .: 18.56
<S> the man whipped his animals , which cleared a way through the crowd ; but on arriving on the quai they were obliged to stop ; the carriage was upset , the horses carried off , stifled , mangled by the crowd .: 54.88
<S> i reasoned thus money , time , and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family ; probabilities will not suffice , only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend .: 137.24
<S> you have succeeded ; the prince is beaten , since he can no longer fight .: 43.17
<S> look , behind this wall , said de comminges , knocking against the wall .: 41.88
<S> d artagnan returned to change his workman s clothes for his chestnut colored suit , and porthos to put on his red doublet .: 49.36
<S> but we were not captured by fair means ; and before we had time to draw our swords , two of our party were dead , and athos , grievously wounded , was very little better .: 47.10
<S> the meeting after merce de s had left monte cristo , he fell into profound gloom .: 36.69
<S> oh , my heart !: 11.66
<S> he entered with a tolerably dignified step , and some little haste .: 61.32
<S> the battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor .: 162.34
<S> i do not understand you , sir , replied monte cristo ; and if i did , your tone is too high .: 17.37
<S> be kind enough , then , to send me 500,000 francs tomorrow .: 23.44
<S> if he knew anything about horses he would dispute the price . faith !: 100.15
<S> but stop !: 52.37
<S> the eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor , and on the blue line separating the sky from the mediterranean sea , they perceived a large white sail .: 43.56
<S> her eyes , however , betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire .: 74.76
<S> yes , speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton , and as a treat drink beer .: 181.78
<S> they had arrested him for the purpose of robbery , and as he had only a few louis about him , he doubted not he would be ransomed .: 29.95
<S> p .: 176.67
<S> the count seized it hastily , his eyes immediately fell upon the epigraph , and he read : thou shalt tear out the dragons teeth , and shall trample the lions under foot , saith the lord . ah , he exclaimed , here is my answer .: 46.64
<S> did i ever say to you , when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist , and cut off the head of one of my party , my son , you have committed a murder ? no , i said , very well , sir , you have gained the victory ; tomorrow , perchance , it will be our turn . but , father , take care ; when our turn comes , our revenge will be sweeping . i do not understand you . you rely on the usurper s return ? we do . you are mistaken ; he will not advance two leagues into the interior of france without being followed , tracked , and caught like a wild beast . my dear fellow , the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble ; on the 10th or 12th he will be at lyons , and on the 20th or 25th at paris . the people will rise . yes , to go and meet him . he has but a handful of men with him , and armies will be despatched against him . yes , to escort him into the capital .: 48.33
<S> at length the light disappeared .: 21.97
<S> cloud , opposite d estre es s pavilion ?: 198.54
<S> this time he fell on his knees , and , clasping his hands convulsively , uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone .: 32.17
<S> my dear fellow , i think we should ask you that question ; you know such news much better than we do .: 38.52
<S> the first three remained constantly in a small waiting room , ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell , or to receive the orders of the romaic slave , who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress s wishes to the three other waiting women ; the latter had received most peremptory instructions from monte cristo to treat hayde e with all the deference they would observe to a queen .: 87.64
<S> the names of all , including carlini , were placed in a hat , and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket ; the ticket bore the name of diavolaccio .: 57.01
<S> ah , your pardon , said dante s , frowning in his turn ; i did not perceive that there were three of us . then , turning to merce de s , he inquired , who is this gentleman ? one who will be your best friend , dante s , for he is my friend , my cousin , my brother ; it is fernand the man whom , after you , edmond , i love the best in the world .: 23.93
<S> i fix on boulogne because i presume that every town in france is indifferent to you ; if you prefer another , name it ; but you can easily conceive that , surrounded as i am by influences i can only muzzle by discretion , i desire your presence in paris to be unknown . i go , sir , said mordaunt , advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered .: 64.80
<S> you are in a hurry , captain ! danglars , said edmond , smiling , i will say to you as merce de s said just now to caderousse , do not give me a title which does not belong to me ; that may bring me bad luck . your pardon , replied danglars , i merely said you seemed in a hurry , and we have lots of time ; the pharaon can not be under weigh again in less than three months . we are always in a hurry to be happy , m. danglars ; for when we have suffered a long time , we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune .: 35.34
<S> meantime , you see that the lackeys saddle the horses . i have no horse , said d artagnan ; but that is of no consequence , i can take one of monsieur de tre ville s. that is not worth while , said aramis , you can have one of mine . one of yours !: 31.20
<S> he leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning brazier .: 30.79
<S> all villefort s influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret dante s had so nearly divulged .: 79.99
<S> what is yonder ? cried d artagnan .: 11.37
<S> oh , you knew that well enough before speaking to me , said andrea , becoming more and more excited .: 39.31
<S> well , now you understand , mother ! continued albert ; here are more than 4,000 francs settled on you ; upon these you can live at least two years . do you think so ? said merce de s .: 31.79
<S> at three o clock the sound of fireworks , let off on the piazza del popolo and the piazza di venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to begin .: 40.19
<S> he lighted it and retired .: 32.65
<S> i tell you , valentine s life was attempted by poison four days ago , though she escaped , owing to the precautions of m. noirtier .: 41.29
<S> yes , said the old man .: 5.07
<S> oh , my god , i have suffered enough surely !: 22.60
<S> i am of d artagnan s opinion ; we have no time to lose in regaining our camp . my faith , said athos , i have nothing to say against a retreat .: 22.24
<S> madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari ; i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre , who is under some obligation to me .: 60.03
<S> let us go and die with them ! said the king .: 10.19
<S> he thought himself in a sepulchre , into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated .: 58.77
<S> the young man , prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings , which were mournful , and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through , descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king , who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there ; and who appeared to abide on that spot , that he might thus address human pride , so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne : dust of the earth !: 62.45
<S> who has taken my piece of glass ? asked the duke , frowning .: 25.23
<S> then those who dwelt in bonacieux s unfortunate house , together with the nearest neighbors , heard loud cries , stamping of feet , clashing of swords , and breaking of furniture .: 123.01
<S> no , my prince , replied mazarin , the third bed is intended for your highness . but your eminence ? replied the prince .: 26.96
<S> a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this gentleman .: 57.01
<S> now , i thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as i have blessed you , from the bottom of my heart . the count bowed again , but lower than before ; he was even paler than merce de s .: 30.70
<S> no ! you undertook to do so . true , replied danglars ; the french have the superiority over the spaniards , that the spaniards ruminate , while the french invent . do you invent , then , said fernand impatiently .: 67.47
<S> planchet took place behind his master , and kept at a distance of ten paces from him .: 21.42
<S> but from whom did this ring come to you , athos ? from my mother , who inherited it from her mother .: 53.72
<S> about three months ago i was near having a duel with aramis concerning a handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his house for a handkerchief marked in the same manner , i am sure . monsieur , said the young woman , you weary me very much , i assure you , with your questions . but you , madame , prudent as you are , think , if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief , and that handkerchief were to be seized , would you not be compromised ? in what way ?: 44.30
<S> then ? said athos .: 14.57
<S> gentlemen , said he , let us drink to him who presides at the repast .: 22.00
<S> help , help ! cried mademoiselle d armilly , taking the bell from her companion s hand , and ringing it yet more violently .: 31.14
<S> the next morning at the same hour , the jailer came again .: 16.98
<S> oh , do not say so ; it will break my resolutions . but not mine , mother , replied albert .: 28.18
<S> for me ? said d artagnan , seizing the letter .: 14.84
<S> a hundred louis ?: 43.04

<S> to sleep after the manner i speak of , absolute calm and silence are necessary , and then a certain preparation i know the famous hashish ! precisely .: 145.45
<S> ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners ; i had ennui , and i amused myself with twisting that rope . felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated , and over her head he perceived a gilt headed screw , fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons .: 63.24
<S> as he thus reflected , he felt the sensation we have described , and which had hitherto been unknown to him , arise in his bosom , and fill him with vague apprehensions .: 44.13
<S> four thousand nine hundred and ninety eight louis , said peppino ; you have paid two louis in advance . 50255m what ?: 82.90
<S> if i had but the time to train pupils !: 93.14
<S> i am something of a physician , and have , like my fellows , sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter ; yet , like providence , it has remained invisible to my eyes , although present to my heart .: 84.81
<S> yes , and pretty tight too , i can tell you , was the answer .: 34.34
<S> that might do if we were dealing with englishmen or germans . oh , may god keep me from it , and you , too ! said d artagnan .: 46.11
<S> no ; i will go down , seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready gagged . that is better , said the gascon .: 41.74
<S> did you come to noisy to defend him ? i am waiting for no one , replied d artagnan , who was beginning to be angry .: 18.74
<S> bonacieux at home chapter xviii .: 61.87
<S> benedetto , you are fallen into terrible hands ; they are ready to open for you make use of them .: 59.52
<S> he stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired .: 71.51
<S> you thought to escape my munificence , but it is in vain .: 47.22
<S> maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse , gazed all around the room , then upon the two men ; he opened his mouth to speak , but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain , he went out , thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that villefort and d avrigny , for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic , exchanged glances , which seemed to say , he is mad ! but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight .: 55.74
<S> a ball had passed through his breast .: 21.58
<S> i would have given 10,000 i would have given 20,000 .: 58.61
<S> stay , said mazarin , drawing the ring from his finger , my dear d artagnan , there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly , it is but just it should return to you ; take it , i pray . d artagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting , and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water , he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure .: 40.72
<S> d avrigny returned about eight o clock in the morning ; he met villefort on his way to noirtier s room , and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept .: 19.58
<S> i had quarelled with him some time previously , and had even challenged him to fight me ; but he refused . now we are getting on .: 58.60
<S> two months ago you were dying with hunger . the appetite grows by what it feeds on , said caderousse , grinning and showing his teeth , like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling .: 128.82
<S> at the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her ; it was mme .: 17.02
<S> tell vitray to come to me , said he , and tell him to get ready for a journey . an instant after , the man he asked for was before him , booted and spurred .: 43.72
<S> he was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the moment .: 34.37
<S> i assure you , i shall be very much in the way in that little boat , said mousqueton .: 24.46
<S> in prison he had suffered his beard to grow ; his head fell on his shoulder , his legs bent beneath him , and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious .: 49.35
<S> he remembered the count of monte cristo .: 11.07
<S> what battle does it represent ? that of marignan , just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to francis i. , who has broken his .: 83.31
<S> if you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .: 14.15
<S> i ask your pardon , my dear count , said albert , for following you here , and i must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that i did so ; i alone am to blame for the indiscretion .: 28.02
<S> our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough . i have never seen him put to the test , replied raoul , but he is a breton , which promises something . yes , yes , resumed de guiche ; i am sure he can fire a musket when required .: 52.59
<S> at eleven o clock kitty came to him .: 12.65
<S> this man , who was hastening towards the wood , was already three quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest .: 35.60
<S> that would be a far better life than i lead now ; but monsieur mazarin is a mean wretch , who won t dispossess himself of his diamond in my favor . on entering the rue tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the house .: 70.22
<S> oh dear , yes , sir ; the abbe s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of bonaparte s emissaries , one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815 , a very resolute and very dangerous man . indeed ! said the englishman .: 44.37
<S> it is astonishing , said he .: 9.33
<S> who could ever have believed it ! a moment afterwards julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers , a portfolio , and a bag of money .: 83.05
<S> people fight for all sorts of reasons , you know . i fight in the cause of honor . ah , that is something serious . so serious , that i come to beg you to render me a service . what is it ? to be my second . that is a serious matter , and we will not discuss it here ; let us speak of nothing till we get home .: 54.26
<S> besides , how do i know that this was not a political trick , that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition , and jealous of the popular sympathy i excite , has not concerted with m. debray to ruin me ? a probable thing ! why not ?: 60.95
<S> ask m. de morcerf into the drawing room , said he to baptistin , while he led the beautiful greek girl to a private staircase .: 32.93
<S> he went gayly up to the sailors , who rose as soon as they perceived him ; and the patron , accosting him , said : the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency , and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person ; but he trusts you will excuse him , as very important business calls him to malaga . so , then , gaetano , said franz , this is , then , all reality ; there exists a man who has received me in this island , entertained me right royally , and has departed while i was asleep ? he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread ; and if you will use your glass , you will , in all probability , recognize your host in the midst of his crew . so saying , gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica .: 69.60
<S> come down ! athos came down ; his friends , who anxiously awaited him , saw him returned with joy .: 47.53
<S> very little , except long live cromwell ! where were you placed ? mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the general s face if this was simply a useless question , or whether he knew everything .: 67.62
<S> tis not too warm to walk , resumed d artagnan .: 34.44
<S> the address , to monsieur the baron danglars , banker , rue de la chausse e d antin . caderousse wrote the address .: 43.17
<S> the count patted him gently on the shoulder , his usual mode of praising ali , who , pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him , walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house , and , seating himself thereon , began to smoke his chibouque , while monte cristo re entered his dwelling , perfectly assured of the success of his plan .: 58.79
<S> it is not very difficult to say . tell us , then , d artagnan . we are going to reach the nearest seaport , unite our little resources , hire a vessel and return to france .: 32.45
<S> alone ! never again to see the face , never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth !: 131.54
<S> the closet into which d artagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only , and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room , whilst the aperture between the two hangings , small as it was , permitted them to see .: 55.85
<S> oh , for pity s sake , said she , you will live , will you not ? no , on my honor , said maximilian ; but that will not affect you .: 12.98
<S> i can not tell you how long we remained in this state ; at that period i did not even know what time meant .: 28.10
<S> after the two friends had been chatting a few moments , a servant from m. de tre ville entered , bringing a sealed packet .: 32.09
<S> then , though yourself a servant , you have other servants to wait upon you , take care of your clothes , and see that your linen is duly prepared for you .: 55.22
<S> they know that i am intimate with you that you are , in fact ; one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintances and they will not find you at my house ; they will certainly ask me why i did not invite you .: 32.72
<S> the cardinal , however , did not unseal the letter at once , but continued to turn it again and again in his hand ; then , in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them , fixing his eyes upon them at the same time , he thus addressed the messenger : you are very young , monsieur mordaunt , for this difficult task of ambassador , in which the oldest diplomatists often fail . my lord , i am twenty three years of age ; but your eminence is mistaken in saying that i am young .: 44.86
<S> this new eruption was more dangerous than the others , being composed of armed men .: 46.27
<S> the parliament condemned charles to death , as might have been foreseen .: 78.51
<S> you are going now to pay your court to her again , and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face , it will be much worse than before . instinct made poor kitty guess a part of what was to happen .: 63.47
<S> here i am , smiled porthos , with his sublime composure .: 38.31
<S> guilty ?: 257.28
<S> the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns , according to the italian custom , and , as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the table the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form are well understood , the supper table was loaded with wax lights and flowers .: 91.58
<S> i know no better means than to act with candor .: 49.55
<S> on the walls , over the doors , on the ceiling , were swords , daggers , malay creeses , maces , battle axes ; gilded , damasked , and inlaid suits of armor ; dried plants , minerals , and stuffed birds , their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight , and their beaks forever open .: 113.61
<S> and does he not live in the champs e lyse es ? yes , no .: 17.61
<S> are you not rather young , m. andrea , to think of marrying ? i think not , sir , replied m. cavalcanti ; in italy the nobility generally marry young .: 49.67
<S> underneath a lamp in an inn , anywhere , they ask are you one of the fronde ? they unsheathe , and that s all that is said .: 76.66
<S> he mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain .: 73.03
<S> then you know the men who are now on monte cristo ? oh , yes , we sailors are like freemasons , and recognize each other by signs . and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land ? nothing at all ; smugglers are not thieves . but these two corsican bandits ? said franz , calculating the chances of peril .: 50.70
<S> but do you think , asked albert , that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger ? what sort of person is this count of monte cristo ? asked franz of his host .: 25.72
<S> this was now all changed .: 44.05
<S> does he regret me a little ?: 67.03
<S> well ? said the baroness .: 8.46
<S> good , said he , our syndic is at his post . he knocked and the door was opened .: 26.04
<S> listen , whispered villefort to valentine , who could not conceal her joy ; if m. noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage , i forbid you to understand him . valentine blushed , but did not answer .: 39.46
<S> save me ! porthos and aramis arose .: 20.93
<S> as to the second vessel , we will tell hereafter whom it carried , and how it set sail .: 106.13
<S> this devil of a fellow , he muttered , shaking his head ; i said at the time he would create a sensation here , and i measure his effect by an infallible thermometer .: 45.94
<S> thank you , said edmond with a friendly nod , and the two lovers continued on their way , as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven .: 37.54
<S> a blasphemy .: 108.44
<S> but the moment is come to keep your word ; i have reached my destination . and you will have nothing to fear on your return ? i shall have nothing to fear but robbers . and that is nothing ? what could they take from me ?: 28.93
<S> athos , look at mordaunt s smile .: 48.40
<S> it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill .: 68.99
<S> my lord , said d artagnan , advancing toward the cardinal , it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time .: 16.39
<S> replace him on his orange horse , and let him begone ! not before i have killed you , poltroon ! cried d artagnan , making the best face possible , and never retreating one step before his three assailants , who continued to shower blows upon him .: 84.24
<S> he is a worthy , honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for anybody .: 63.04
<S> it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend , or that athos was bound by some invisible chain , or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant s visit .: 39.81
<S> d artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron .: 61.57
<S> then he thought he was going to die .: 13.08
<S> the four friends were reunited .: 17.90
<S> all the artillery was ready to move , and started off at a moment s notice .: 36.18
<S> it was empty , and dante s emerged from the tunnel .: 18.83
<S> the champs e lyse es ?: 19.90
<S> they can move their arms , they can , and that is much .: 45.58
<S> it is excellent advice .: 32.47
<S> let us call one of these lackeys , with a demi pistole in the left hand . exactly so , cried aramis .: 38.06
<S> send me the keeper of the seals , se guier . and that man , what has your eminence done with him ? what man ? asked the cardinal .: 30.35
<S> so you are here ! cried the officer , in the tone of ill humor habitual to him ; what the devil are you doing here ? i wish to know can you tell me , pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town ? what do you mean ?: 26.51
<S> hush , we are flying ! i did not understand .: 34.03
<S> he must be mad , said the inspector .: 12.97
<S> these were the first words he had spoken .: 26.47
<S> take out the horses quickly , and come up to me , said andrea to his groom .: 27.97
<S> move on , then . and the bier was lifted once more , and they proceeded .: 60.71
<S> what is to be said ?: 19.21
<S> when they spoke , although teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier , as luigi could read in the ardent looks of the good looking young man that his language was that of praise , it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him , and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination .: 74.75
<S> as to getting him drunk , the duke couldn t hope to do that , and he laughed at the mere thought of it .: 50.27
<S> your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news ; you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words .: 205.20
<S> on the other hand , mazarin , present at that audience , heard very well what those deputies demanded .: 109.90
<S> the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly accomplished their transformation and flight ; the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs .: 90.03
<S> on entering the court of his ho tel , buckingham sprang from his horse , and without thinking what became of the animal , threw the bridle on his neck , and sprang toward the vestibule .: 26.08
<S> as regards the marchesa corsinari really , said the major , difficulties seem to thicken upon us ; will she be wanted in any way ? no , sir , replied monte cristo ; besides , has she not yes , sir , said the major , she has 30127m paid the last debt of nature ? alas , yes , returned the italian .: 49.06
<S> it was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood , for she bit her lips till they bled , scratched the end of her nose , and could not sit still in her seat .: 54.32
<S> well , since there is another finer and younger , why , you may take the old one ; and let us drink . what ? asked the host , quite cheerful again .: 52.02
<S> at that moment ali touched him slightly on the shoulder .: 30.21
<S> my mother thought me dead ; she is not guilty .: 38.35
<S> the boat , indeed , seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence , so promptly did it obey the slightest touch ; and dante s required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding .: 79.49
<S> it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself , possessors , as you are , of immense fortune at least , so it is said and i beg you to observe that i do not inquire , i merely repeat ; it is not usual , i say , for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society , in philosophical reveries , intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world . really , sir , retorted the count , have you attained the eminent situation in which you are , without having admitted , or even without having met with exceptions ?: 67.89
<S> and who ? d artagnan and his friends . indeed , they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the bastille . why is it not done already ? what would you ?: 23.68
<S> the man in the mantle quitted the wall , and advanced into the middle of the street .: 16.07
<S> then , calling planchet , he said , now , my lad , you may claim your seven hundred livres , but you did not run much risk with such a note as that . i am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it , said planchet .: 47.74
<S> i went to your house , and they told me you were out , but that they expected you home at ten o clock to breakfast .: 34.09
<S> d artagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses ; they thought it was mousqueton and went up to him .: 27.64
<S> the scotch , he exclaimed , the scotch i called my faithful , to whom i trusted myself when i could have fled to oxford !: 63.82
<S> for example , you see these two fish ; one brought from fifty leagues beyond st. petersburg , the other five leagues from naples .: 75.11
<S> instead of that air of life , of comfort , and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishment instead of merry faces at the windows , busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors instead of the court filled with bales of goods , re echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters , one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom .: 139.91
<S> as well as i could judge by the light of the sun , the day was already two thirds gone .: 40.97
<S> but , said he , so long as i do remain in paris , and nothing forces me to quit it , do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me ? you may . shall i receive it from my father ? asked andrea , with some uneasiness .: 32.06
<S> d artagnan , who had just dismounted , then saw , outlined against the wall , the enormous stomach of mousqueton , whose down drawn mouth emitted sounds of distress .: 78.28
<S> she tried to replace the arm , but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick nurse .: 47.88
<S> two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle .: 22.31
<S> contrary to custom , the door was open , and having no occasion to ring he entered .: 54.74
<S> mademoiselle de villefort is the culprit she is the poisoner !: 38.88
<S> de guitaut , mme .: 60.21
<S> he turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist , when he started back , exclaiming , raoul ! raoul ? cried athos .: 49.68
<S> oh , how distinctly i remember that kiss ! it was the last he ever gave me , and i feel as if it were still warm on my forehead .: 42.60
<S> but i too have had the idea you have , and two or three times the same fancy has come over me ; but i have always given it up .: 35.41
<S> c sar , poisoned at the same time , escaped by shedding his skin like a snake ; but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger s .: 64.24
<S> i know no one but myself who is acquainted with the noble art of venery .: 40.04
<S> i see ! said he , there are two of them ; one does the work while the other stands guard . he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street , and turned to the one in the dressing room .: 30.35
<S> dante s would have shouted , but he knew that the wind would drown his voice .: 30.85
<S> since that period of history queens have shed tears , like other women .: 187.07
<S> only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier , or the queen marie de me dicis , i should use less precautions than i take , being simply called milady clarik . that is just , said richelieu .: 66.78
<S> covered with flames , assunta rushed wildly to the door , but it was fastened ; she flew to the windows , but they were also secured ; then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks ; it was assunta calling for help .: 79.58
<S> someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged .: 71.90
<S> once , sir , when i was grafting a rose tree . well , suppose you were to alter a signal , and substitute another ? ah , that is another case ; i should be turned off , and lose my pension . three hundred francs ? a hundred crowns , yes , sir ; so you see that i am not likely to do any of these things . not even for fifteen years wages ?: 47.99
<S> i make no requests or commands ; i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own , and then judge for yourself . the young man reflected for a moment , then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes , and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets , the insignia of his rank .: 45.79
<S> the cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of anne .: 24.12
<S> when i leave him , i place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majesty s special guard .: 69.78
<S> i am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys are leading about .: 109.77
<S> come , come , murmured d artagnan , rochefort has kept his promise , but where in the devil is he ? and he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses , but there was no sign of rochefort .: 37.41
<S> you were writing . i ? your fingers are stained with ink . ah , true , i was writing .: 50.06
<S> let us see , said the queen , what the count says . and she opened the letter and read : madame , being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself , by reason of a wound i have received in my right hand , i have commanded my son , the count de guiche , who , with his father , is equally your humble servant , to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of lens , and that this victory can not fail to give great power to cardinal mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of europe .: 34.45
<S> never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant .: 81.09
<S> this is not chance , for chance , in this case , is too much like providence . well , amiable corsican , let us suppose it is providence .: 45.84
<S> i , too , said porthos , who , faithful to the instructions , still held the cardinal s arm .: 24.04
<S> what is his name ? you know him . indeed . yes . it is surely not one of my friends ? replied d artagnan , affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant .: 30.03
<S> this beverage required a good half hour to prepare .: 94.03
<S> you are a faithful friend , felton . felton took back the weapon , and laid it upon the table , as he had agreed with the prisoner .: 30.12
<S> and is he still in love with the catalane ? over head and ears ; but , unless i am much mistaken , there will be a storm in that quarter . 0041m explain yourself . why should i ? it is more important than you think , perhaps .: 48.07
<S> this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak .: 33.89
<S> when i see her majesty embarrassed , i shall conduct her to rueil , make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box . enough , sir , muttered the cardinal , you have said enough ; where is the treaty ? here it is , replied aramis .: 47.98
<S> i can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged . villefort cast a gloomy look around him .: 45.89
<S> as i have already told you , sir , he was a very dangerous man ; and , fortunately , by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account . how was that ? how ?: 37.85
<S> out of the twenty musketeers sixteen , when this took place , rejoiced greatly at this relaxation ; but the other four cursed it heartily .: 145.75
<S> you were right , sir , said anne .: 11.17
<S> a piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper , and he snatched a few hours sleep , lying over the mouth of the cave .: 45.99
<S> what do you want with us ? he asked of groslow .: 13.32
<S> i recognize you perfectly . the poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow , behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion .: 80.35
<S> listen , captain baldi ; there s one way of settling this , said jacopo .: 90.33
<S> men of the robe and men of the sword on the day after these events had taken place , athos not having reappeared , m. de tre ville was informed by d artagnan and porthos of the circumstance .: 34.98
<S> as happy as possible ; and yet , sir , you may make me even happier than i am . well , speak , if it depends on me . oh , sir !: 27.95
<S> this time , as he was well attended , he looked at them sternly , and made a sign with his eye and hand for d artagnan to follow him .: 22.14
<S> certainly , there are people whom i love .: 35.24
<S> who is in command here ? asked the cardinal .: 20.81
<S> bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the bastille .: 104.34
<S> i found my knife where i had placed it , under my pillow , and while feigning to sleep , my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively .: 43.65
<S> left alone , d artagnan read and reread his billet .: 57.32
<S> george villiers placed himself before the glass , as we have said , restored the undulations to his beautiful hair , which the weight of his hat had disordered , twisted his mustache , and , his heart swelling with joy , happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for , he smiled upon himself with pride and hope .: 68.36
<S> the young girl then continued , speaking slowly , like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating .: 58.67
<S> he did not wear the uniform cloak which was not obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence but a cerulean blue doublet , a little faded and worn , and over this a magnificent baldric , worked in gold , which shone like water ripples in the sun .: 91.60
<S> the riot becomes a revolution .: 66.92
<S> since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with them .: 70.39

<S> beware , monsieur ; there is certainly some magic underneath . meanwhile , the young man had darted in to his chamber , and opened the letter .: 48.32

<S> d artagnan owned nothing .: 48.88
<S> they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them ; and , in fact , they went away quite proud and happy . oh , the miserable wretches ! murmured the queen , they shall pay dearly for their boldness , and it is i who promise this . then turning to d artagnan , she said : sir , you have given me this evening the best advice i have ever received .: 35.89

<S> milady , reclining in an armchair near the chimney , beautiful , pale , and resigned , looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom .: 53.92
<S> don quixote took windmills for giants , and sheep for armies ; d artagnan took every smile for an insult , and every look as a provocation whence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled , or his hand on the hilt of his sword ; and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw , nor did the sword issue from its scabbard .: 112.35
<S> but what i know is that i promise to do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are going . and you will leave me then ? yes . without waiting for my coming out again ? yes . word of honor ? by the faith of a gentleman .: 30.20

<S> at the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard , and villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where d avrigny and morrel had been staying , one absorbed in meditation , the other in grief .: 21.81
<S> such songs disturb the mind ; and yet we become accustomed to them , her voice is so beautiful . chapter liv .: 88.78
<S> merce de s has no fortune ; i have none to settle on her .: 28.19
<S> she cried out , but d avrigny paid no attention to her ; possessed with but one idea , he cleared the last four steps with a bound , and rushed into the kitchen , where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter , where it had been left .: 58.70
<S> what did he say ? some parting words to his friends . his friends ! murmured cromwell .: 46.44
<S> still silent : valentine had promised not to wake .: 129.11
<S> they never overtook the chimerical friend , yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed , for a green cabriolet and bay horse ; and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries , and as nine tenths of them are green , the inquiries increased at every step .: 133.39

<S> my son , said anne of austria , pointing to the musketeer , calm , standing uncovered , here is monsieur d artagnan , who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women .: 26.14
<S> besides , the king , i am certain , awaits your majesty s reply before risking anything . you will tell him , my lord , resumed the queen , despairingly , that i can do nothing ; that i have suffered as much as himself more than he has obliged as i am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears ; and as regards his royal person , he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king .: 56.80
<S> he extended a hand to raoul and said : my young friend , all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the count here ; for he has educated me in everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions .: 65.04
<S> what are you looking at ? asked d artagnan .: 9.11
<S> the carnival was over .: 18.57
<S> ah !: 7.24

<S> dante s turned and perceived that they had got out to sea .: 28.88
<S> the noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me .: 46.76
<S> well , said morcerf , for three days i believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque , whom i took for a descendant of tullia or popp a , while i was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina , and i say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl .: 73.65
<S> where were they taken ? asked athos .: 18.53
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> if you make a single step to find her you are lost . that s pretty positive , continued d artagnan ; but after all , it is but a menace . yes ; but that menace terrifies me .: 31.71
<S> i don t know him .: 8.24
<S> the man opened his eyes , made an effort to raise his head , and fell back again .: 14.39
<S> what shall i say to the cardinal ? you can tell him , sir , answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battle field , that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men ; of fighting man to man , without discomfiture , against the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay , and of surrendering only to fifty men !: 42.49
<S> never had he been so well received .: 44.61
<S> lovely women , yielding to the influence of the scene , bend over their balconies , or lean from their windows , and shower down confetti , which are returned by bouquets ; the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers .: 88.17
<S> yes , replied noirtier .: 9.89
<S> is it from thee ?: 51.98
<S> it is a gift from my beautiful englishwoman , or rather frenchwoman for i am convinced she was born in france , though i have not questioned her . that ring comes from milady ? cried athos , with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong emotion .: 41.97
<S> oh , pray do , for heaven s sake , tell us all about is he a vampire , or a resuscitated corpse , or what ? i fancy i have seen him before ; and i even think he recognizes me . and i can well understand , said the countess , shrugging up her beautiful shoulders , as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins , that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him . the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself ; another , and wholly uninterested person , felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving .: 58.95
<S> the study does not take long ; it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious . and what is the pay ? a thousand francs , sir . it is nothing . no ; but then we are lodged , as you perceive . monte cristo looked at the room .: 35.24
<S> these individuals are under arrest .: 86.32
<S> i crossed the street , and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall , and by means of which i had once before looked into the garden .: 27.35
<S> i was wondering what could be the significance of this purse , with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other . count , replied maximilian , with an air of gravity , those are our most precious family treasures . the stone seems very brilliant , answered the count .: 48.14
<S> a step , a gesture , a word , on your part , denoting an effort to escape , and you are to be fired upon .: 46.01
<S> for the rest , if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound , i will listen to him with the greatest pleasure . three curates remained those of st. merri , st. sulpice and st. eustache .: 66.10
<S> you will accomplish what i was to have done , and derive all the honor and profit from it . i will do it , captain ; but perhaps i shall not be admitted to the grand marshal s presence as easily as you expect ? here is a ring that will obtain audience of him , and remove every difficulty , said the captain .: 51.87
<S> i am a gentleman born , and my blood is warm , as you may have remarked , my dear d artagnan .: 22.92
<S> as soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together .: 68.16
<S> his two companions were already on horseback .: 14.90
<S> then taking a paper out of his pocket , he unfolded it slowly .: 27.25
<S> m. d avrigny alone had followed madame de villefort with his eyes , and watched her hurried retreat .: 35.06
<S> as to athos , faithful to his system of reticence , he contented himself with interrogating d artagnan by a look .: 34.81
<S> help , help ! barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few steps , then fell at the feet of noirtier , and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid , exclaimed : my master , my good master ! at this moment m. de villefort , attracted by the noise , appeared on the threshold .: 30.76
<S> hush ! returned rochefort .: 36.40
<S> fifty cavaliers ! cried the gascon and porthos .: 29.86
<S> the expulsion took place and i pocketed 600,000 francs the day charles v. repassed the bidassoa .: 218.23
<S> she wept abundantly ; and let us speak it to the praise of m. d artagnan the younger notwithstanding the efforts he made to remain firm , as a future musketeer ought , nature prevailed , and he shed many tears , of which he succeeded with great difficulty in concealing the half .: 91.12
<S> you have told me how you talk to him and how he answers you ; i shall very soon learn that language by signs , valentine , and i promise you solemnly , that instead of despair , it is happiness that awaits us . oh , see , maximilian , see the power you have over me , you almost make me believe you ; and yet , what you tell me is madness , for my father will curse me he is inflexible he will never pardon me .: 47.09
<S> after finishing that calculation , i had a minute s hope .: 76.27
<S> grimaud gave a grim smile .: 51.72
<S> a light yacht , chaste and elegant in its form , was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake , extending from gibraltar to the dardanelles , and from tunis to venice .: 75.11
<S> those who are known are not the most dangerous . i know it , and appeal to your penetration .: 49.40
<S> it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother , unwilling to part from her son , and yet aware that a young man of the viscount s age required the full exercise of his liberty , had chosen this habitation for albert .: 57.04
<S> the blood mounted instantly to the temples of d artagnan , who arose , and replied : i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits . on seeing d artagnan rise , porthos rose also ; these four men were therefore all standing at the same time , with a menacing aspect , opposite to each other .: 54.45
<S> in the place of the palais royal d artagnan saw a sergeant , who was drilling six or seven hundred citizens .: 27.64

<S> copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change .: 43.19
<S> yes , but he has been avenged .: 16.21
<S> that the day after tomorrow i shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs ; but the count , expecting my bachelor s revenue could not suffice for the coming month s outlay , has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs .: 59.19
<S> d artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it , making it over about a dozen times ; and since he was supposed to have paid , like the others , a louis for his truss of straw , he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour .: 51.52
<S> he was stout , had a short , thick neck ; he was attacked with apoplexy , and i was called in too late .: 50.88
<S> i invite you with good will . thank you , replied the jeweller , it must be getting late , and i must return to beaucaire my wife will be getting uneasy . he drew out his watch , and exclaimed , morbleu ! nearly nine o clock why , i shall not get back to beaucaire before midnight !: 42.39
<S> three times athos knocked without receiving an answer .: 112.39
<S> the boy undertook the commission , promising to be in frosinone in less than an hour .: 50.69

<S> nevertheless , as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody , he stood still .: 100.20
<S> no .: 17.05
<S> at length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle , and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of aunay .: 27.11
<S> oh , do something for me . the doctor flew to his patient .: 34.46
<S> i assure you that , as long as i live , i shall never love anyone else ! do you think to reassure me when you say that , maximilian ? pardon me , you are right .: 22.64
<S> tis a bad example .: 61.25
<S> no ; but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintance in your own country , for instance . my dear little love !: 44.83
<S> for the demon of speculation drew a line , or in other words projected a street , at the farther side of the kitchen garden .: 70.98
<S> allegro ! he called out to the postilions at every ascent .: 80.29
<S> there is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table , so la ramee , when receiving his plate of soup from grimaud , presented a type of perfect bliss .: 93.61
<S> oh , my god , my god , i thank thee ! madame ! said athos , madame , in the name of heaven , whose empty glass is this ? mine , monsieur , said the young woman , in a dying voice .: 19.38
<S> except this , he has no pretension to nobility , and calls himself a chance count , although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction . his manners are admirable , said the countess , at least , as far as i could judge in the few minutes he remained here . they are perfect mother , so perfect , that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europe the english , the spanish , and the german . the countess paused a moment ; then , after a slight hesitation , she resumed .: 63.32
<S> i think it is time to stop this torrent of mortality .: 37.71

<S> two hours thus glided away .: 57.13
<S> fighting here , are you ?: 43.90
<S> you grow a little too warm , in my opinion , about the fate of madame bonacieux .: 38.37
<S> the count of monte cristo , i believe ? said he .: 10.64
<S> sire , we have all been blind , and the minister of police has shared the general blindness , that is all . but said villefort , and then suddenly checking himself , he was silent ; then he continued , your pardon , sire , he said , bowing , my zeal carried me away .: 43.84
<S> come along , danglars , and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses . danglars took advantage of caderousse s temper at the moment , to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saint victor , staggering as he went .: 47.45
<S> what matters this punishment , as long as he is avenged ?: 34.16
<S> pardon you , monseigneur !: 26.97
<S> well , in my turn i advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure , my dear monsieur groslow , for i can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of it . not without my defending it , said groslow .: 33.74
<S> can i do anything for you , gentlemen ? asked the duke .: 13.55
<S> port wine .: 58.84
<S> at this instant m. de tre ville entered , cool , polite , and in irreproachable costume .: 20.87
<S> it is impossible a gentleman could have written such a letter to a woman . then all at once , starting , she cried , my god !: 40.41
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> i can pass . that is true , said mousqueton , glancing at his friend s long and thin body , you will pass easily . and he knows the full casks , said blaisois , for he has already been in the hold with monsieur le chevalier d artagnan .: 43.93
<S> upon my word , you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him . oh , as for parricides , and such dreadful people as that , interposed rene e , it matters very little what is done to them ; but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues why , that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit ; for , don t you see , rene e , the king is the father of his people , and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty two millions of souls , is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale ? i don t know anything about that , replied rene e ; but , m. de villefort , you have promised me have you not ? always to show mercy to those i plead for . make yourself quite easy on that point , answered villefort , with one of his sweetest smiles ; you and i will always consult upon our verdicts . my love , said the marquise , attend to your doves , your lap dogs , and embroidery , but do not meddle with what you do not understand .: 75.49
<S> he whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field .: 64.81
<S> yes , he said .: 5.63
<S> and then it was that , won by his mild charity , seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country , and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which i was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind , i besought him to receive my confession , under the seal of which i recounted the auteuil affair in all its details , as well as every other transaction of my life .: 77.81
<S> alas , would i could weep like you ! and he drew away his friend , as affectionate as a father , as consoling as a priest , noble as a man who has suffered much .: 39.55
<S> good day , m. morrel , said he , as if he had just quitted marseilles the previous evening , and had just returned from aix or toulon .: 26.68
<S> and he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the rue des fossoyeurs , whilst d artagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of planchet under present circumstances .: 35.97
<S> stop an instant , the name seems certainly familiar .: 83.01

<S> i pray for it , said d artagnan .: 8.27
<S> turning towards athos and his friends , gentlemen , said he , allow me to correct your words , if you please .: 25.73
<S> the delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel , but this dante s declined with many thanks , saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone , and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself ; the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed s head , the closet to contain three divisions , so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself .: 122.02
<S> coquenard understood it .: 63.90
<S> now , in spite of the nobility of his countenance , the command of which , like a finished actor , he had carefully studied before the glass , it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity .: 42.56
<S> better , then , pursue our enterprise ; from which , besides , we can not retreat without shame .: 57.58
<S> this man was dressed in a greatcoat , or rather a surtout , a little worse for the journey , but which exhibited the ribbon of the legion of honor still fresh and brilliant , a decoration which also ornamented the under coat .: 75.73
<S> let me see your plan ; i dare say it is a pretty one . why not ?: 24.85
<S> the four or five remaining hours before nine o clock arrived , andrea employed in riding , paying visits , designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the banker s in their gayest equipages , dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain , and in which danglars was just taking the initiative .: 98.45
<S> is the king wounded ? cried lord winter .: 26.78
<S> he is moving ; and if he has taken off his mask i shall be able to see .: 28.52
<S> he was wrapped in a large rough cape , which concealed his form and partly his face .: 44.16
<S> as for euge nie , she was as strong as a judith or a delilah .: 31.69
<S> mistrust yourself , john , said he .: 33.14
<S> consequently , the procureur is very active in the affair , and the prefect of police very much interested ; and , thanks to that interest , for which i am very grateful , they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood , under pretence of their being caderousse s murderers , so that in three months , if this continues , every robber and assassin in france will have the plan of my house at his fingers ends .: 51.65
<S> robert le diable the pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible , as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the acade mie royale .: 112.77
<S> he was dressed in plain clothes , and wore at his button hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged .: 44.72
<S> he is at bergen , in norway . heaven preserve him ! said the queen .: 31.43

<S> milady , however , smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing .: 79.13
<S> for example , here is debray who reads , and beauchamp who prints , every day , a member of the jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard ; four persons have been assassinated in the rue st. denis or the faubourg st. germain ; ten , fifteen , or twenty thieves , have been arrested in a cafe on the boulevard du temple , or in the thermes de julien , and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the maremma , the campagna di romana , or the pontine marshes .: 71.27

<S> m .: 15.88
<S> during the twenty years i served , i often wished to do so , but i had not the time . these are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other , returned monte cristo .: 46.31
<S> then the foolish criminal is taken , imprisoned , interrogated , confronted , confounded , condemned , and cut off by hemp or steel ; or if she be a woman of any consideration , they lock her up for life .: 105.28
<S> well , said albert in a determined tone , you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family , and i insist on a retractation being made . you insist ? yes , i insist . permit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber , my dear viscount . nor do i wish to be there , replied the young man , rising .: 30.34

<S> xxii .: 109.57
<S> debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony , but on the same plane with everyone else , and without any particular privilege .: 82.83
<S> speak ! tis this : when we escape together , that i shall go everywhere and be always first ; for if my lord should be overtaken and caught , there s every chance of his being brought back to prison , whereas if i am caught the least that can befall me is to be hung . true , on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest . now , resumed grimaud , i ve only one thing more to ask that your highness will continue to detest me . i ll try , said the duke .: 65.66
<S> but , continued aramis , the details escape me . and me also , said porthos .: 33.81
<S> at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind , so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war , by his new contributions to its methods , he had also made a revolution at paris , among the young noblemen of the court , whose natural chief he was and who , in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court , modeled after bassompierre , bellegarde and the duke d angouleme , were called the petits maitres .: 65.43
<S> they were those we rode on ; and you may rely upon me for the others not being inferior to them .: 78.61
<S> science loves eccentricities , leaps and bounds , trials of strength , fancies , if i may be allowed so to term them .: 139.17
<S> that would spoil my plans . sir , said the gardener , glancing at the sun dial , the ten minutes are almost up ; i must return to my post .: 47.15
<S> it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious , cried d artagnan , but the queen , whom the king abandons , whom the cardinal persecutes , and who sees the heads of all her friends fall , one after the other . why does she love what we hate most in the world , the spaniards and the english ? spain is her country , replied d artagnan ; and it is very natural that she should love the spanish , who are the children of the same soil as herself .: 48.60
<S> no , replied monte cristo ; god grant i may not have done too much already . the next day they indeed left , accompanied only by baptistin .: 58.57
<S> this lady was the daughter of nicholas de camus , who arrived in paris with twenty francs in his pocket , became secretary of state , and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself .: 79.62
<S> well ! said porthos and aramis together , as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing , well , he signed the paper she required ! i know it , said athos , coolly , since here it is . and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters , except to give the watchword to the sentinels .: 35.74
<S> so call me merce de s , if you please . we must excuse our worthy neighbor , caderousse , said dante s , he is so easily mistaken . so , then , the wedding is to take place immediately , m. dante s , said danglars , bowing to the young couple .: 27.44
<S> ali , having pointed to the apartments , held up three fingers of his right hand , and then , placing it beneath his head , shut his eyes , and feigned to sleep .: 27.58
<S> sleeplessness inflamed my eyes ; i had not dared to sleep a single instant .: 63.52
<S> but you said that your name was d artagnan . who , i ? yes , you . somebody said to me , you are monsieur d artagnan ? i answered , you think so ? my guards exclaimed that they were sure of it .: 31.16
<S> no , no , cried the countess ; you must not leave me .: 11.87
<S> that astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that cucumetto was stationed ten paces in carlini s rear when he fell .: 103.47
<S> d artagnan , said athos , with a maniacal burst of laughter , guess what she had on her shoulder . how can i tell ? said d artagnan .: 22.12
<S> do with this commission what you will ; only remember , though the name be blank , it is to you i give it . i shall never forget it , replied d artagnan .: 40.16
<S> antoinette is very well , he said , and madeleine tolerably so .: 71.62
<S> you are the offended party , count . doubtless ; what does that imply ? that you will fire first . i fire first ? oh , i obtained , or rather claimed that ; we had conceded enough for them to yield us that . and at what distance ? twenty paces . a smile of terrible import passed over the count s lips .: 85.96
<S> let the man go , d artagnan ; let us save the woman . monsieur , monsieur ! cried a hostler , running out and looking after the stranger , monsieur , here is a paper which dropped out of your hat !: 39.04
<S> stop !: 27.26
<S> we shall save you another time , as we have done this , only with a better chance of success , because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance . my good edmond , answered the abbe , be not deceived .: 47.73
<S> the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court , both in the name of morality , and for the respect due to humanity .: 77.73
<S> well , well , cried d artagnan , this reconciliation is truly touching ; have you not tears in your eyes , porthos ? yes , said porthos ; but i do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep ; i think it is the wind . now climb up , athos , quickly , said d artagnan .: 30.55
<S> important and urgent , said he .: 58.29
<S> in each there was an enemy to contend with , and contributions to be levied .: 77.71
<S> yes , monsieur , we are cousins , said porthos , without being disconcerted , as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband .: 49.54
<S> he remained there some time alone .: 72.37
<S> the two friends sat down and aramis began to cut up fowls , partridges and hams with admirable skill .: 47.13
<S> he resides in a quiet quarter , continued aramis ; his tastes and his profession require it .: 85.78
<S> as for d artagnan , he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the pomme de pin , where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him .: 21.90
<S> he had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not escaped with her waiting maid poor kitty !: 69.85
<S> he formed , therefore , the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past , hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future .: 85.27
<S> well ! said aramis .: 8.26
<S> the half pistole is ready , and he put it back again into his pocket .: 28.25
<S> because , sir , said the president , you have insulted a man , and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation . another method of assassination ? said the general , shrugging his shoulders .: 36.87
<S> but this is infamous ! cried he .: 20.69
<S> julie threw herself into his arms .: 18.13
<S> on coming near the bank , she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight .: 68.52
<S> d artagnan returned to less important affairs , and the three musketeers repaired to the king s quarters , where they had to prepare their lodging .: 30.47
<S> sinbad the sailor ? he said .: 21.87
<S> were it liquid gold , monsieur blaisois , our masters would not deny themselves this wine .: 175.56
<S> he was not mistaken ; peering through the crevices of the wooden partition , he soon discovered the young girl , who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier .: 50.95
<S> the fe tes are veritable pleasure days to the italians .: 182.76
<S> i say that you must surrender your sword to me , monsieur , and that without resistance .: 31.14
<S> how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch .: 45.18
<S> but the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor .: 24.31
<S> as for me , it made me tremble .: 17.69
<S> it was day .: 30.91
<S> ah ! cried blaisois , he is lost ! grimaud s a cunning fellow , murmured mousqueton .: 37.37
<S> what has happened ? lord ! ejaculated the young princess , falling on her knees , have mercy on us ! sir , said chatillon , if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the queen . aramis went so close to chatillon as almost to touch him .: 49.60
<S> then , resumed he , mad , desperate , determined to get rid of an existence from which she had stolen everything , honor and happiness , my poor brother returned to lille , and learning the sentence which had condemned me in his place , surrendered himself , and hanged himself that same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison .: 59.40
<S> yes , you were thinking of it , and with justice .: 23.04
<S> there is no question , you understand , provided we secure our own interests , of securing those of the frondeurs ; who , besides , don t understand political matters as we old soldiers do . never fear , dear friend , said porthos .: 56.17
<S> salute my hero , viscount . and he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing , with large and open brow , piercing eyes , and black moustache , whom our readers have already seen at marseilles , under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten .: 72.88
<S> no , sir , and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious . in fact , said aramis , there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly .: 34.64
<S> they are prevented at this moment , but will join us later . mazarin coughed a little .: 60.56
<S> you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors , monsieur , said he ; it is a handsome uniform . no one could have said what caused the count s voice to vibrate so deeply , and what made his eye flash , which was in general so clear , lustrous , and limpid when he pleased .: 66.86
<S> well , m. morrel , said danglars , you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us ? yes yes : poor captain leclere !: 29.80
<S> it was estimated at fifty thousand francs . bless me ! exclaimed caderousse , fifty thousand francs !: 49.26
<S> louvieres recognized him and bowed .: 126.66
<S> and now , prisoner , will you consent to tell your name ? said the president .: 24.46
<S> monte cristo motioned to ali to undress him , and he then examined his dreadful wounds .: 39.61
<S> athos and aramis kept themselves to their role .: 31.14
<S> the stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way .: 37.45
<S> d artagnan slipped into the wardrobe .: 19.41
<S> ah , what is that ? cried the brigadier .: 10.35
<S> gaetano , who had proposed the expedition , had taken all the responsibility on himself ; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him , while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away , which , thanks to the darkness , would not be difficult .: 38.50
<S> valentine !: 48.59
<S> bonacieux ; the man resembled aramis so much as to be mistaken for him .: 61.32
<S> but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business ; i intended this money for the charity fund , and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds .: 93.47
<S> at length , one by one , all the noises in the neighborhood ceased .: 41.20
<S> you know the interest we both take in this poor little madame bonacieux .: 75.71
<S> money !: 95.10
<S> i expected this , said felton .: 20.90
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> however , he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts .: 60.08
<S> it was nearly ten o clock .: 9.07
<S> at the same moment that he quitted the room , villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door .: 22.68
<S> do you not perceive that we are opposite the ho tel d arguillon , which is full of the cardinal s creatures ?: 25.03
<S> once in france he turned his course toward paris , and reaching paris went straight to rue tiquetonne .: 61.36
<S> i have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches . chapter 62 .: 46.87
<S> the young man went to her and took her hands ; then she sobbed aloud .: 20.83
<S> steps approach i go adieu ! and dante s , happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend s mental instability , glided like a snake along the narrow passage ; while faria , restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity , pushed the stone into place with his foot , and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery .: 107.34
<S> see paragraph 1.e below .: 65.00
<S> the next morning , therefore , when broussel made his entrance into paris in a large carriage , having his son louvieres at his side and friquet behind the vehicle , the people threw themselves in his way and cries of long live broussel ! long live our father ! resounded from all parts and was death to mazarin s ears ; and the cardinal s spies brought bad news from every direction , which greatly agitated the minister , but was calmly received by the queen .: 102.11
<S> have you anything particular against him ? possibly . did you ever meet him previously to coming hither ? i have . and where ? will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what i am about to tell you ? i promise . upon your honor ? upon my honor . then listen to me . franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the island of monte cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there , and the two corsican bandits with them .: 35.59
<S> it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon , had bestowed on him a son , named king of rome even in his cradle .: 82.81
<S> then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity , and those are the best of all .: 120.25
<S> bonacieux , for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world ; but the voice was all .: 43.19
<S> bonacieux looked at the young man , restrained for a minute by a last hesitation ; but there was such an ardor in his eyes , such persuasion in his voice , that she felt herself constrained to confide in him .: 51.17
<S> conspiracy chapter 5 .: 52.84
<S> de sable , mme .: 64.21
<S> do you wish to speak to us ? asked morrel .: 7.45
<S> dante s asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another , even if it were darker and deeper , for a change , however disadvantageous , was still a change , and would afford him some amusement .: 75.48
<S> she bore me rapidly away .: 90.41
<S> now , my wife came home four days ago , monsieur .: 50.30
<S> well , said the latter , a young woman of about twenty six or twenty eight years of age , and a man of from thirty five to forty , have indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your eminence ; but the woman left last night , and the man this morning . it was they ! cried the cardinal , looking at the clock ; and now it is too late to have them pursued .: 40.14
<S> how do you feel , barrois ? asked he .: 17.19
<S> but is not your eminence going to the queen ? for what purpose ? monsieur de guitant , my uncle , has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army . it is well ; i will go . comminges had seen rightly , and mordaunt had really acted as he had related .: 37.63
<S> humanity , in a battle .: 68.54
<S> fie ! d artagnan , d artagnan , cried aramis , you are killing me ! well , here it is at last ! said d artagnan , as he drew the letter from his pocket .: 13.40
<S> you think then , as i do , that she deceives me ? said the king .: 17.58
<S> what do you mean , beauchamp ? oh , yes ; do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the minister s ? said beauchamp , placing his eye glass in his eye , where he tried to make it remain .: 31.42
<S> then , according to foreign custom , the presentations took place .: 60.15
<S> bonacieux , my punishment is drawing to a close .: 85.19
<S> still further , monsieur de tre ville gains ten thousand crowns a year ; he is therefore a great noble .: 41.50
<S> well , how much for the equipments ? if we say one hundred pistoles for the three good for the hundred pistoles ; there remains , then , three hundred and fifty . porthos made a sign of assent .: 35.04
<S> he was very pale .: 11.86
<S> i will wear it , i swear to you , as a grateful man should do . tis well ; arise , vicomte , embrace me . raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the count s arms .: 44.07
<S> these two men met at one point and that was , cunning ; had they been actuated equally by courage , the one would have done great things for the other .: 64.32
<S> we are on the very eve of it .: 28.32
<S> all three agreed to meet at noon in whitehall place to see how things went on .: 92.81
<S> the coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king , queen , and cardinal , all three together .: 107.46
<S> i have made up the loss of blood by nutrition .: 48.82
<S> de winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother . then , said athos , woe to de winter , for the child had done no harm . may the devil take me , if the child be not dead , said porthos .: 39.03
<S> because , said the old man , the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it ; and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty .: 112.19
<S> the body forgets sometimes ; but the mind always remembers . and how far back into the past do your recollections extend ? i could scarcely walk when my mother , who was called vasiliki , which means royal , said the young girl , tossing her head proudly , took me by the hand , and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed , we went out , both covered with veils , to solicit alms for the prisoners , saying , he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord . then when our purse was full we returned to the palace , and without saying a word to my father , we sent it to the convent , where it was divided amongst the prisoners . and how old were you at that time ? i was three years old , said hayde e .: 71.26
<S> the traveller alighted , ordered a good dinner , and inquired the address of the house of thomson french , which was immediately given to him , as it was one of the most celebrated in rome .: 23.62
<S> monsieur d artagnan ! said mazarin , you are worth your weight in gold . chapter liii .: 18.68
<S> you will also see that the greek servants hold no communication with those of this country . he bowed .: 76.43
<S> if he lays his hand on the boat s edge i will cut it off , regicide that he is . and i , said porthos .: 29.92
<S> the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind , gliding on the water .: 86.40
<S> neither had his eyes bandaged .: 75.80
<S> help !: 33.86
<S> look well at his right hand , on which he has a large wound ; if you forgot his features , you would know him by that hand , into which fell , one by one , the gold pieces of the merchant el kobbir ! i know him !: 48.21
<S> i would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to you misfortunes entirely beyond your control , and which in no degree diminish my regard for you i would wish to know if they have not , in some measure , contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure ? sir , returned the young man , with a reassurance of manner , make your mind easy on this score .: 55.99
<S> on the cross i swear , if i ever leave this place , to call down vengeance upon you from the whole human race ! beware ! said the voice , in a threatening accent that i had never yet heard .: 62.32
<S> they were passed by a sort of courier , covered with dust , the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal , giving testimony to the valor of d artagnan and porthos .: 30.47
<S> besides , kitty would not like to live in the rue aux ours .: 25.08
<S> this is the point of departure ; it is a syllogism .: 23.31
<S> ah , yes ; we burn , as they say at the game of pincette .: 35.23
<S> only i concealed a glass of water , which remained after my breakfast , thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when i remained forty eight hours without eating or drinking .: 81.03
<S> at the same moment a well known voice above him pronounced these words : colonel , i want to speak to the people . athos shuddered from head to foot .: 55.78
<S> and that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty s service .: 66.18
<S> it was you who were behind my bed curtains that night the parisians wished to see me asleep . and if the king permits me , returned the gascon , i shall be near him always when there is danger to be encountered . sir , said mazarin to porthos , what would you do if the crowd fell upon us ? kill as many as i could , my lord . hem !: 57.11
<S> at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing place , their eyes fixed on the boat , evidently seeking to know who the new comers were and what were their intentions .: 57.85
<S> on seeing this figure , mute and immovable as a statue , milady was frightened .: 44.22
<S> excuse me , albert , sorrow on your account , and delight with that noble girl , thus pursuing paternal vengeance .: 86.60
<S> you have an excellent memory , milady . but , resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment , if , in spite of all these reasons , the duke does not give way and continues to menace france ? the duke is in love to madness , or rather to folly , replied richelieu , with great bitterness .: 45.73
<S> you agree that you have no remedies for negligence , strict liability , breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1.f.3 .: 32.30
<S> exactly like me !: 82.07
<S> the other was in a feminine hand , long , and crossed .: 45.29
<S> if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law .: 14.71
<S> he is a musician . so are all italians . come , count , you do not do that young man justice . well , i acknowledge it annoys me , knowing your connection with the morcerf family , to see him throw himself in the way . danglars burst out laughing .: 61.89
<S> the officer leaned forward , looked at her in his turn , and appeared surprised to see that face , just before so beautiful , distorted with passion and almost hideous .: 50.68
<S> wait . how long ? i must calculate our chances ; i will give you the signal . but you will not leave me ; you will come to me , or you will let me come to you .: 21.05
<S> three blows were struck upon the panel of the door .: 38.30
<S> he had no fears as to how he should live good seamen are welcome everywhere .: 123.70
<S> i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much , and which feared nothing , and i went to the king s attorney . and this king s attorney was named villefort ? asked monte cristo carelessly .: 27.26
<S> at last i mastered my agitation .: 47.18
<S> yes , monsieur , said d artagnan , lowering his voice , and you will pardon me , i hope , for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business . speak , then , i am all attention . it concerns nothing less , said d artagnan , than the honor , perhaps the life of the queen . what did you say ? asked m. de tre ville , glancing round to see if they were surely alone , and then fixing his questioning look upon d artagnan .: 24.00
<S> it is my happiness , my treasure , my hope .: 24.79
<S> the moment you become an inhabitant of france , you are naturally subjected to the french law . i know it sir , replied monte cristo ; but when i visit a country i begin to study , by all the means which are available , the men from whom i may have anything to hope or to fear , till i know them as well as , perhaps better than , they know themselves .: 58.81
<S> let us save ourselves . at these words she passed her arm under that of d artagnan , and urged him forward eagerly .: 33.81
<S> oh , maximilian , maximilian , you are certainly concealing something from us . pshaw ! said monte cristo , you will see him return to you gay , smiling , and joyful . maximilian cast a look of disdain , almost of anger , on the count .: 40.62
<S> she drew her husband to the door .: 21.42
<S> the side windows were hung with yellow damask , and the centre one with white damask and a red cross .: 39.03
<S> yet they will forget me here , and i shall die in my dungeon like faria . as he said this , he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought .: 88.90
<S> on a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage , it stopped .: 24.50
<S> but no , the communication would not come through madame de villefort . why not ? because i scarcely know why but it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly objected to the marriage , although she did not choose openly to oppose it . is it so ?: 48.70
<S> i am here ; what do you want with me ? and at these words , the musketeer , in irreproachable costume , belted as usual , with a tolerably firm step , entered the cabinet .: 23.51
<S> milady uttered a frightful shriek , and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her judges .: 47.50
<S> it is told that the duc d antin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed louis xiv .: 55.95
<S> where is thy master ? you stand upon his property ! but how handsome thou art how fat !: 122.26
<S> debray , to whom she had run , with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves , and who yet betrays her , debray could but give her advice , she must apply to someone more powerful than he .: 62.12
<S> de morcerf s , who is deceased . for what reason ? because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired . and what are they to live upon ? the mother retires into the country , and the son enters the army . 50113m well , i must confess , these are scruples . i registered their deed of gift yesterday . and how much did they possess ? oh , not much from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs .: 83.61
<S> i see you know him , exclaimed the wife ; for you have become pale in your turn . truly , cried the host , misfortune is coming on our house ; it is the former executioner of bethune . the former executioner of bethune ! murmured the young monk , shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired .: 39.98
<S> at this instant the door opened .: 6.36
<S> he resolved , then , to defend the door bravely ; and as , betrayed by the mistress of the inn , he could not say that aramis was absent , he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference , which had commenced with the morning and would not , as bazin said , terminate before night .: 53.69
<S> here the deputies of the parliament had just arrived , in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were to last three weeks , and produced eventually that shameful peace , at the conclusion of which the prince was arrested .: 54.63
<S> on the spot it had occupied was a circular space , exposing an iron ring let into a square flag stone .: 141.78
<S> the french government , without protecting them openly , as you know , gave countenance to volunteer assistance .: 88.63
<S> alexander vi .: 41.23
<S> porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of m. de tre ville and the guardroom of the louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes , after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies , from the lawyer s dame to the baroness , there was question of nothing less with porthos than a foreign princess , who was enormously fond of him .: 68.54
<S> she looked at the clock , rose , reseated herself , smiled at d artagnan with an air which said , you are very amiable , no doubt , but you would be charming if you would only depart . d artagnan rose and took his hat ; milady gave him her hand to kiss .: 29.71
<S> alas , no , i know not .: 15.13
<S> what !: 14.83
<S> it is that we are each of us twenty years older ; it is that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of interest , whispers of ambition , counsels of selfishness .: 50.25
<S> a magnificent cavalier , remarked mazarin .: 57.92
<S> excitement was at its height among the musketeers and their allies , and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the ho tel to punish the insolence of m. de la tre mouille s domestics in daring to make a sortie upon the king s musketeers .: 47.82
<S> what does he mean ? asked a gendarme .: 11.08
<S> the king was a few steps behind me , when suddenly i saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow .: 48.97
<S> in addition to the sword thrust in his arm , which is not dangerous , he has received another right through his lungs , of which the doctor says bad things . but has the wounded man retained his senses ? perfectly . does he talk ? with difficulty , but he can speak . well , monsieur , let us go to him .: 66.96
<S> but return to your question . 30151m does mademoiselle danglars object to this marriage with m. de morcerf on account of loving another ? i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with euge nie . yes , but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate ; own , now , that you did question her on the subject .: 94.60
<S> it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by d artagnan .: 81.67
<S> raoul had only been at m. scarron s house ; he named to guiche the people whom he had seen there .: 52.19
<S> yes , my captain . as they went , the citizens , awakened , left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers , barking .: 68.60
<S> anne then motioned to d artagnan to approach , and he obeyed .: 27.99
<S> we can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the pont neuf . lucien half smiled .: 80.15
<S> so many dreadful things have happened to me lately that i am on the verge of madness . has anyone besides me seen madame de saint me ran ? no . has anything been sent for from a chemist s that i have not examined ? nothing . had madame de saint me ran any enemies ? not to my knowledge . would her death affect anyone s interest ? it could not indeed , my daughter is her only heiress valentine alone .: 86.86
<S> die in peace ! lord de winter advanced in his turn .: 26.25
<S> milady shuddered .: 22.88
<S> donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations .: 65.39
<S> i searched , ransacked , counted , calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years .: 85.04
<S> what next ? de wardes can not boast of anything . how is that ?: 39.94
<S> faria , since their first acquaintance , had been on all points so rational and logical , so wonderfully sagacious , in fact , that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness .: 86.39
<S> she stretched out her arms to him , but they seized hold of her , and one of the three none other than the accursed benedetto exclaimed : put her to torture and she ll soon tell us where her money is . it unfortunately happened that our neighbor , wasilio , was at bastia , leaving no person in his house but his wife ; no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling .: 153.41
<S> yes , yes !: 10.51
<S> my friend , said he , here is a proof of it . 40176m albert opened the paper , it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of yanina , proving that colonel fernand mondego , in the service of ali tepelini , had surrendered the castle for two million crowns .: 46.54
<S> my faith , my good host , said d artagnan , filling the two glasses , i asked for a bottle of your best wine , and if you have deceived me , you will be punished in what you have sinned ; for seeing that i hate drinking by myself , you shall drink with me .: 30.31
<S> why , your excellency , returned the landlord , chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency , i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel . i see that plainly enough , my most excellent host , and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go .: 78.66
<S> one instant after , the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridor his ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder .: 62.95
<S> well , happily , i don t say nay to it .: 19.47
<S> yes . these three yeses had been pronounced by athos , each with a sadder intonation .: 68.85
<S> queer , though .: 158.23
<S> you know , sir , that they wished to murder that good councillor , broussel , the father of the people ? really , did they ? said d artagnan .: 35.60
<S> the time for wine came .: 88.82
<S> but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened . athos , you are becoming mad . no , my friend , athos gently replied , but de winter sought us out in france and introduced us , monsieur d herblay and myself , to madame henrietta .: 53.86
<S> what have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity , about twelve days ago , to make an accusation of passing false money ? the host became as pale as death ; for d artagnan had assumed a threatening attitude , and planchet modeled himself after his master .: 49.30
<S> you will bind yourself , cried the king , by what monsieur de la tre mouille shall say ? yes , sire . you will accept his judgment ? undoubtedly . and you will submit to the reparation he may require ? certainly . la chesnaye , said the king .: 35.60
<S> the officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him .: 36.39
<S> at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was announced .: 7.93
<S> the count praised bertuccio s zeal , and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure , as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a month .: 59.23
<S> look at this lady , raoul , she is an historic personage ; it was to visit her king henry iv .: 36.02
<S> that word ill becomes my faded lip now , but it is a memory dear to my heart , and one that i would not lose for all that the world contains .: 89.01
<S> on opening the door , villefort found himself facing him , and the young magistrate s first impulse was to pause .: 27.53
<S> what ails you , baron ? he exclaimed .: 11.29
<S> this website includes information about project gutenberg , including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation , how to help produce our new ebooks , and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks .: 72.62
<S> he invited me to dine with him on saturday , which was a very natural thing for him to do .: 23.03
<S> oh , if my mother were still living , there would be nothing to fear , maximilian , for i would tell her that i loved you , and she would protect us . i fear , valentine , replied the lover , that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you ; you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me . now it is you who are unjust , maximilian , cried valentine ; but there is one thing i wish to know . and what is that ? inquired the young man , perceiving that valentine hesitated .: 27.94
<S> oh , i will be revenged ! i believed that madame loved him . i love him ?: 46.91
<S> sir , said aramis , you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner .: 37.10
<S> d artagnan refused ; but thinking the opportunity a good one , he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued , as he wished to turn it into money .: 42.69
<S> well ? asked aramis .: 8.70
<S> the young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely .: 77.74
<S> oh , as for that , i ll take you to a splendid place , said the man with the handkerchief ; and taking the horse s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him .: 52.51
<S> but what is the matter with my hands ! asked milady ; it seems as if my wrists had been crushed in a vice . milady held out her arms ; her wrists were bruised .: 39.87
<S> must you know all ? absolutely ; and rather from your lips than another s. muster up all your courage , then , for never have you required it more . albert passed his hand over his forehead , as if to try his strength , as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword .: 69.13
<S> oh , of the most unfortunate kind , monsieur .: 41.49
<S> we are going to execute your wishes . may heaven prosper you ! replied the dying man , with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe .: 34.16
<S> who i ? cried milady ; i a protestant ?: 99.28
<S> help !: 33.86
<S> the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice , and the king was very pale .: 14.59
<S> he found him kneeling before a priedieu , with his head leaning on an open prayer book .: 45.59
<S> yes that is a great word , sir .: 31.86
<S> i am acquainted with monsieur de putange ; i met monsieur dujart in england ; i know monsieur de tre ville . monsieur de tre ville ! exclaimed the novice , do you know monsieur de tre ville ? yes , perfectly well intimately even . the captain of the king s musketeers ? the captain of the king s musketeers . why , then , only see ! cried the novice ; we shall soon be well acquainted , almost friends .: 24.77
<S> when he was within twenty paces of it , he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped .: 24.36
<S> but , indeed , i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction .: 28.55
<S> still , the presence of monte cristo at such an hour , his mysterious , fanciful , and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall , might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason .: 62.17
<S> don t try to understand it you will only lose your time . you forgive me , then , sir , said raoul , and you will deign to tell me who is the person that you call the young indian ? certainly ; one of the most charming persons that lives mademoiselle frances d aubigne . does she belong to the family of the celebrated agrippa , the friend of henry iv .: 33.14
<S> i try to be beloved , not feared . well , there is on the wall of my cell , scratched with a nail , a proverb , which says , like master , like servant . pray , what does that mean ? it means that monsieur de richelieu was able to find trusty servants , dozens and dozens of them . he !: 61.50
<S> so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive . dante s raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet .: 23.25
<S> notwithstanding his large stomach , certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the campagna , he slid down like peppino , and closing his eyes fell upon his feet .: 56.07
<S> he cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off teresa , as nessus , the centaur , carried deianira .: 52.98
<S> there s a fellow who will never desert me ! so long as you are rich !: 36.53
<S> the scheme goes forward , it seems . on wheels , dear friend . good !: 74.19
<S> he still felt the same self satisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening , and which had procured him so good a night s rest .: 38.95
<S> i was not willing to fly .: 17.04
<S> fire , fire ! cried mordaunt , returning to the group surrounding the two friends .: 36.12
<S> oh , what a clumsy thing i am , said she with feverish volubility ; i don t know my way .: 35.74
<S> i think i learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal , continued milady ; that would have been another motive for sympathy between us . what i have heard , then , from our good mother is true ; you have likewise been a victim of that wicked priest . hush ! said milady ; let us not , even here , speak thus of him .: 55.85
<S> then she broke the silence to cry out , you are cowards , miserable assassins ten men combined to murder one woman .: 122.85
<S> you may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks !: 82.75
<S> did you not say she was dead ? three times she attempted to kill me , and i pardoned her ; but she murdered the woman i loved .: 36.99
<S> at last , after a few moments , cromwell raised his head , and , as if he divined that some one was there , turned slowly around .: 28.50
<S> i am all attention , madame , said he .: 12.82
<S> the more she has forgotten the high position in which she was placed , the more degrading is her fall .: 68.66
<S> on their arrival at the castle they learned that buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away .: 71.03
<S> besides , he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition , much keenness of wit , and as to suitability , m. danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic that is his word . and then , said euge nie , while turning over the leaves of madame de villefort s album , add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man . and , said madame de villefort , i need not ask you if you share that fancy . i ? replied euge nie with her usual candor .: 36.68
<S> they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the river .: 48.39
<S> that is to say , replied milady , driven into her entrenchment , that i have not the honor of knowing her personally ; but i know a great number of her most intimate friends .: 25.99
<S> you will find yesterday s report of the minister of police .: 36.84
<S> and what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint ? a very simple one , said valentine .: 38.83
<S> the house , which was discernible through the trees , remained in darkness , and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriage contract was going on .: 53.77
<S> oh , women !: 19.54
<S> what are you thinking of , d artagnan ? he began .: 13.86
<S> you are right to recall me to myself , maximilian , he said ; i was delighted to see you again , and forgot for the moment that all happiness is fleeting . oh , no , no , count , cried maximilian , seizing the count s hands , pray laugh ; be happy , and prove to me , by your indifference , that life is endurable to sufferers .: 30.60
<S> but where are you going to eat my breakfast ? asked the host .: 12.76
<S> i thought they might be useful , so i took them . meantime porthos had reloaded his pistols .: 65.94
<S> several inns were visited by them , several innkeepers questioned , without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries , when at montreuil athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers .: 152.76
<S> at midnight the two travelers were at dammartin , but it was then too late to make inquiries the host of the cygne de la croix had gone to bed .: 39.16
<S> if by chance our amphitryon changes his mind and receives only porthos and myself , why , then , we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of one .: 174.98
<S> porthos was seduced by a wine colored doublet and sea green breeches .: 121.34
<S> he has been travelling with a very severe tutor , and had never been to paris before . ah , i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves , do they not ? asked danglars carelessly ; they like to unite their fortunes . it is usual , certainly ; but cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other people .: 80.69
<S> oh , sir ! he cried , passing the bottle to porthos , we are saved the bark is supplied with provisions . this intelligence restored every one save athos to gayety .: 83.71
<S> the coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace ; for like all galley slaves , you said , i may escape from prison , i can not from the grave . and you said truly ; the way was opened for you unexpectedly .: 116.15
<S> signor pastrini remained silent a short time ; it was evident that he was musing over this answer , which did not seem very clear .: 35.51
<S> the young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness .: 53.43
<S> project gutenberg ebooks are often created from several printed editions , all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the u.s. unless a copyright notice is included .: 31.97
<S> m. de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter .: 33.40
<S> one may be very comfortable in a convent ; and as soon as the siege of la rochelle is terminated , i promise you on my part good , cried athos , good !: 39.52
<S> the boy found him sitting where d artagnan had left him , still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary .: 30.45
<S> whom shall i announce ? said the attendant .: 45.95
<S> if they catch thee , thou wilt be hung . true , replied grimaud .: 52.13
<S> excuse me , said d artagnan , endeavoring to resume his course , excuse me , but i am in a hurry . scarcely had he descended the first stair , when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him .: 28.03
<S> don t forget the signal : jesus seigneur ! and he went out as he came in , whistling the self same air .: 63.01
<S> now , m. bertuccio is alone in the world ; he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it ; he is sure never to leave my service . why ? because i should never get a better . probabilities are deceptive . but i deal in certainties ; he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death . do you possess that right over bertuccio ? yes . there are words which close a conversation with an iron door ; such was the count s yes . the whole journey was performed with equal rapidity ; the thirty two horses , dispersed over seven stages , brought them to their destination in eight hours .: 75.39
<S> if it were as you pretend it is , said he , i should be forced , my dear aramis , to reclaim it myself ; for , as you very well know , bois tracy is an intimate friend of mine , and i can not allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy . you make the demand badly , replied aramis ; and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation , i refuse it on account of the form . the fact is , hazarded d artagnan , timidly , i did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis .: 41.93
<S> but the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword hilts , and among those who set upon him the king recognized captain groslow .: 91.35
<S> is that what you would say ? he has some , but he is very avaricious ; that is his fault .: 25.41
<S> the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him , never pronouncing a word himself , and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle .: 57.67
<S> i beg your pardon , sir , said the honest fellow , in almost breathless haste , but i believe you made a mistake ; you intended to give me a two franc piece , and see , you gave me a double napoleon . thank you , my good friend .: 34.01
<S> suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you ; suppose the poison was , for instance , brucine brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not ? inquired madame de villefort .: 50.84
<S> the cha teau d if the commissary of police , as he traversed the antechamber , made a sign to two gendarmes , who placed themselves one on dante s right and the other on his left .: 26.91
<S> i had designedly taken this direction .: 67.06
<S> why , it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course . is that possible ? true as day .: 74.34
<S> you see , therefore , continued the cardinal , perceiving d artagnan s composure , that , as i have told you , the welfare of the state is placed in your hands . yes , my lord , and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge . you accept , however ? i always accept . do you think the thing possible ? everything is possible . shall you be attacked on the road ? probably . and what will you do in that case ? i shall pass through those who attack me . and suppose you can not pass through them ? so much the worse for them ; i shall pass over them . and you will place the king and queen in safety also , at saint germain ? yes . on your life ? on my life . you are a hero , my friend , said mazarin , gazing at the musketeer with admiration .: 28.51
<S> this horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs , and i don t like to humiliate people . then your duchess is still at the waters ? asked d artagnan .: 50.80
<S> now , then , let us breakfast . with what an air he says all this , muttered beauchamp ; decidedly he is a great man . a great man in his own country , added debray .: 35.49
<S> he is the cause of all this misery i am quite sure of it , whispered caderousse , who had never taken his eyes off fernand , to danglars .: 35.55
<S> then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him , he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied juxon .: 37.02
<S> of this treaty , at least , i have been warned .: 25.07
<S> i suspected it .: 30.91
<S> she was stone dead .: 105.95
<S> still he dared not to enter , as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead .: 58.16
<S> what are you bringing me ? said he .: 15.13
<S> albert looked at his two friends , not timidly , but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done .: 32.79
<S> but the prince de marsillac !: 42.21
<S> you met him at a dinner party at my house , and you introduced yourself at his house ; that is a totally different affair . yes , but , by my marriage , you have forwarded that . i ? not in the least , i beg you to believe .: 38.06
<S> and he threw away his pistol .: 26.80
<S> my mother tried to force the door , that she might go and die with him , but it was fastened on the inside .: 23.86
<S> that is to say , you are in love with this lady as you were with madame bonacieux , said athos , shrugging his shoulders contemptuously , as if he pitied human weakness .: 28.95
<S> they were thus engaged when the count of monte cristo entered .: 22.35
<S> no , madame , answered de winter ; but the case is provided for and i am come to france to seek allies . allies ! said the queen , shaking her head .: 25.09
<S> this child of the desert was in his element , and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared , in the cloud of dust he raised , like the genius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane .: 43.96
<S> the lane was still deserted , and the same calm soft light shone through the window .: 31.34
<S> but tell me well , what do you wish to know ? will not the count of monte cristo be here tonight ? seventeen ! replied albert .: 19.98
<S> it was five o clock in the afternoon ; i ascended into the red room , and waited for night .: 15.37
<S> murder !: 63.98
<S> besides , one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused , in order to lash one s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power .: 56.27
<S> planchet , said d artagnan , cocking his pistols , i will take charge of the one at the top ; you look to the one below .: 34.48
<S> the workmen .: 73.05
<S> that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances ; that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable .: 65.83
<S> he replied , however , in a tone of deep interest : i entreat you , m. de villefort , be , as you always are , kind and equitable , and give him back to us soon . this give us sounded revolutionary in the deputy s ears .: 48.55
<S> we have seen them at villefort s ; they proceeded then on their course .: 37.68
<S> the doctor was a friend of the family , and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day , and very fond of valentine , whose birth he had witnessed .: 18.92
<S> do you observe , said the countess g to albert , who had returned to her side , that man does nothing like other people ; he listens most devoutly to the third act of robert le diable , and when the fourth begins , takes his departure . chapter 54 .: 69.06
<S> having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation , the count , making a signal to ali to follow him , went out by the side gate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned , apparently without design towards paris and at twilight ; found himself opposite his house in the champs e lyse es .: 53.64
<S> this idea , while darkening his brow , drew several sighs from him , and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance .: 55.06
<S> the army marched silently , the prince at the head of the column .: 38.02
<S> in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this m. de monte cristo is , whence he comes , where he goes , and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden . villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him .: 55.86
<S> all was useless , the treasure disappeared , and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off .: 54.87
<S> the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in haste .: 43.48
<S> i will give you 45,000 , said he , but not a sou more ; besides , as that is the exact value of the stone , i brought just that sum with me . oh , that s no matter , replied caderousse , i will go back with you to fetch the other 5,000 francs . no , returned the jeweller , giving back the diamond and the ring to caderousse , no , it is worth no more , and i am sorry i offered so much , for the stone has a flaw in it , which i had not seen .: 36.54
<S> thousands of men , it is true , will have to pay for my happiness with their lives ; but what is that to me , provided i see you again !: 47.64
<S> danglars then opened the window .: 23.83
<S> but , pardon , said d artagnan , with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young man s shoulder , if the illustrious general oliver cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour , he has , of course , made that act of donation in writing . mordaunt stopped short .: 38.48
<S> why , that s as long as the almighty took to make the world !: 41.82
<S> then , continued the host , i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment , i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle ; but monsieur porthos replied that , my house being the best , he should remain where he was .: 58.55
<S> mademoiselle euge nie , however , merely returned a dissenting movement of the head , while , with a cold smile , she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle , in which sat the countess g , and where morcerf had just made his appearance .: 48.13
<S> one day , too , when my wife was ill , he gave me a prescription which cured her . ah , ah ! said the doctor , i did not know that i had a rival ; but i hope , governor , that you will show him all proper respect in consequence . yes , yes , make your mind easy , he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find .: 38.48
<S> still , his sister did not seem uneasy , and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three days , she was sure he was well . ah , now i think of it , the count of monte cristo can not appear in the hall , said beauchamp .: 21.37
<S> ah , my lord , he said , have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those lorraine robbers ? yes , said the prince , if you will serve me as guide . willingly , my lord .: 30.39
<S> another person was confined in the cha teau at the same time , but he was not wicked , he was only a poor mad priest . ah , indeed ? mad ! repeated monte cristo ; and what was his mania ? he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty . monte cristo raised his eyes , but he could not see the heavens ; there was a stone veil between him and the firmament .: 34.48
<S> for a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands , and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror ; but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind , and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks .: 45.28
<S> do you understand now , said the captain , why no complaints are made to the government , and why the vessel never reaches port ? it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition , franz would have hesitated , but now that they had started , he thought it would be cowardly to draw back .: 49.09
<S> doctor d avrigny , said barrois , staggering as if he would fall .: 42.91
<S> and who has seen this fleur de lis ? inquired aramis .: 24.54
<S> be punished alone , for the first , miserable man ! said lord de winter to felton , who was being dragged away with his eyes turned toward the sea ; but i swear to you by the memory of my brother whom i have loved so much that your accomplice is not saved . felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable .: 40.12
<S> the coast , owing to the gascon s stratagem , was clear .: 43.13
<S> drink then , and do not meddle with what we are discussing , for that requires all one s wit and cool judgment . i drunk ! said caderousse ; well that s a good one !: 71.06
<S> our host has a well furnished cellar the key of which never leaves him ; only this cellar has a ventilating hole .: 103.92
<S> the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars ; the other seats were filled by debray , who was placed between the two cavalcanti , and by cha teau renaud , seated between madame de villefort and morrel .: 24.51
<S> look . that is right , replied the mendicant ; dismiss your lackey . in fact , bazin , curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master , kept pace with him as well as he could , and arrived almost at the same time he did ; but his quickness was not of much use to him .: 37.75
<S> captivity : the fourth day chapter lvi .: 38.95
<S> you are coming , my boy ! oh , you don t see straight , said danglars ; he s gone right by the road to the vieilles infirmeries . well , said caderousse , i should have sworn that he turned to the right how treacherous wine is ! come , come , said danglars to himself , now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted . chapter 5 .: 45.91
<S> well , am i to rush into his arms , and strain him to my heart , crying , my father , my father ! like monsieur pixe re court . 27 do not let us jest , gravely replied bertuccio , and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced it . bah , said andrea , a little overcome , by the solemnity of bertuccio s manner , why not ? because the person who bears it is too highly favored by heaven to be the father of such a wretch as you . oh , these are fine words . and there will be fine doings , if you do not take care . menaces i do not fear them .: 59.12
<S> there , edmond dante s ! he said , pointing to the bodies of his wife and child , see , are you well avenged ? monte cristo became pale at this horrible sight ; he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance , and that he could no longer say , god is for and with me . with an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child , reopened its eyes , felt its pulse , and then rushed with him into valentine s room , of which he double locked the door .: 31.43
<S> it was a human storm , made up of a thunder of cries , and a hail of sweetmeats , flowers , eggs , oranges , and nosegays .: 43.80
<S> the poor mercer remained standing at the door , while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him , and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past .: 36.09
<S> he tells me he served your illustrious father , and that he owes his fortune to him . wretch ! exclaimed hayde e , her eyes flashing with rage ; he sold my father to the turks , and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery !: 38.37
<S> the soubrette said , for your master . i have no other master but you ; so a pretty little lass , my faith , is that soubrette ! d artagnan opened the letter , and read these words : a person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest ?: 79.96
<S> while monsieur d arminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure , the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of marsin and of lens a large body of infantry and cavalry .: 35.22
<S> buckingham saw by the expression of the young man s face what was passing in his mind , and he smiled .: 22.13
<S> yes ; speak . then , i will presume to say that all my friends are in the king s musketeers and guards , and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence ; i should , therefore , be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me . do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that i have not yet made you an offer equal to your value ? asked the cardinal , with a smile of disdain .: 46.38
<S> there , said he , it s done .: 23.38
<S> they walked from one end of the chateau to the other , porthos looking with wondering eyes at d artagnan , who was counting on his fingers .: 39.59
<S> i don t see what is to keep me here . a glance was exchanged between athos and aramis .: 29.14
<S> we bet upon one hour , and we have stayed an hour and a half .: 51.24
<S> this news was brought to us .: 43.01
<S> is there any crime in this request ? no , sire . then you will appear ? yes , sire . that is well , said the king , retiring , that is well ; i count upon it . the queen made a curtsy , less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under her .: 38.32
<S> ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six o clock , and howsoever great their prudence might be , they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated .: 82.41
<S> with that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties ; and when you are full of money again , you can redeem it , and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains , as it will have passed through the hands of usurers . athos smiled .: 50.94
<S> will it last long ? by r lady !: 148.13
<S> as things are turning out , i foresee that we must give battle to london , to the provinces , to all england , and certainly in the end we can t fail to be beaten . we ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene , said athos .: 67.60
<S> it is this , sir , said the king , angrily , that general cromwell has reached newcastle ; that you knew it and i was not informed of it ; that the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the tyne against us ; that our sentinels have seen this movement and i have been left unacquainted with it ; that , by an infamous treaty you have sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to parliament .: 54.13
<S> let me go on , captain .: 19.34
<S> sir , i am ready .: 17.58
<S> well , what s the matter ? asked the latter , are you going to be ill just now ? no , but look , replied the hostess , pointing to the wounded man ; i ask you if you recognize him ? that man wait a bit . ah !: 22.69
<S> dante s ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces ; he listened , he groped about , but he heard and saw nothing the cries had ceased , and the tempest continued to rage .: 66.38
<S> he who fires the first shot rarely hits his man , for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed , before an armed foe ; then , whilst he fires , make your horse rear ; that manoeuvre has saved my life several times . i shall do so , if only in gratitude eh ! cried athos , are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder ?: 173.16
<S> he was then reconducted by the little staircase , instead of passing through the ante chamber where d artagnan was waiting .: 27.30
<S> after you , however , said cromwell .: 22.89
<S> monk or priest , it matters not , provided only that he has received from holy church the power of absolving in articulo mortis . monsieur d arminges , said de guiche , remain beside this unfortunate man and see that he is removed as gently as possible .: 91.51
<S> at last they reached the tennis court .: 20.93
<S> learn to know the heart of men , and henceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust vengeance . milady , with a rapid gesture , opened her robe , tore the cambric that covered her bosom , and red with feigned anger and simulated shame , showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that beautiful shoulder .: 99.43
<S> she practiced all the evening , and then went to bed , replied mademoiselle corne lie .: 48.77
<S> gloves of gray kid , matching the hat , well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand ; whilst his boots , similar in color to the hat and gloves , confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old .: 111.47
<S> why , he remarked to gaetano , you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga , while it seems he is in the direction of porto vecchio . don t you remember , said the patron , i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands ? true ; and he is going to land them , added franz .: 40.60
<S> i love your devotedness , said milady .: 24.00
<S> the night is gloomy , and the tiber is very near the via macello . franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude .: 40.65
<S> this was the costume that best became the king .: 44.66
<S> do you think i ever sleep , then ?: 25.25
<S> be kind enough , then , madame , to act more compliantly . the conduct is infamously violent !: 94.69
<S> what say you to that crime , of which i have the proof ? she was my mother . on our return to france she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the augustines at bethune .: 50.68
<S> perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men , and i suffered more than they would have done in my place ; that is all . the countess stopped for a moment , as if gasping for breath .: 37.88
<S> he then saw the great aqueducts , those stone phantoms which he had before remarked , only then they were on the right hand , now they were on the left .: 61.55
<S> emmanuel received him ; this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face , for every new face might be that of a new creditor , come in anxiety to question the head of the house .: 62.72
<S> he placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty , who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace .: 30.27
<S> i beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier . and athos , bowing , retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece , a spectator of the scene .: 37.25
<S> well ! cried d artagnan , tell us all about it . dame , that s a long job , monsieur . you are right , planchet , said athos ; besides , the tattoo has been sounded , and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much longer than the others . so be it , said d artagnan .: 32.75
<S> the president put it to the vote , and it was decided that the investigation should take place .: 27.09
<S> at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door , pale , trembling , and as if ready to faint .: 22.69
<S> he retired to his toilet .: 31.41
<S> then rising , with his head still covered , in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner , charles began .: 50.97
<S> but i have seen things so extraordinary , that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might . merce de s was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of edmond .: 70.31
<S> the pretty mme .: 72.64
<S> once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure ; but until that time , i warn you that in my capacity of general of the army i shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across . de guiche and raoul glanced at each other , smiling .: 78.54
<S> do you know me , madame ? said he .: 6.35
<S> monseigneur , i was furnished with a description of your horses , your lackeys , your countenances nothing was omitted . go on , go on ! said d artagnan , who quickly understood whence such an exact description had come .: 62.10
<S> i may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond , faithful , and unalterable affection , whenever you visit your favorite bower , unless , indeed , it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman , clad in a blouse and cap . a faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of valentine , who almost instantly said , in a saddened tone , as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart : alas , no , maximilian , this must not be , for many reasons .: 90.27
<S> this letter was in milady s handwriting ; only this time it was addressed to m. d artagnan , and not to m. de wardes .: 26.40
<S> you must die . athos , pale as a ghost , repeated these words to the man , who , seeing the bodeful preparations that were making , put himself in an attitude of defense .: 46.10
<S> you see me devoted to you , body and soul , my life and each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service ; you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours that were i to lose you i would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery ; yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another !: 107.34
<S> d artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes ; it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him .: 21.79
<S> and that house in which the plenipotentiaries are , asked athos , belongs to to monsieur de chanleu , who commands your troops at charenton .: 73.03
<S> morrel understood it ; he knew he must call assistance .: 47.90
<S> i have given you all i have , and i beg leave to tell you that this is the bottom of my sack . but i think it would be still better , said aramis , to inform the queen and lord de winter at the same time . yes ; but who is to carry the letter to tours , and who to london ? i answer for bazin , said aramis .: 25.99
<S> that was what he could not know .: 24.11
<S> does your majesty remember , when playing in the park of fontainebleau , or in the palace courts at versailles , ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder ? yes , certainly . well , then , this noise of thunder , however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing , has said , go in , sire .: 66.97
<S> la ramee , i recommend monsieur le duc to you , particularly ; treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated ; that is , never leave him alone an instant . la ramee became , therefore , the duke s dinner guest by compulsion an eternal keeper , the shadow of his person ; but la ramee gay , frank , convivial , fond of play , a great hand at tennis , had one defect in the duke s eyes his incorruptibility .: 76.47
<S> sir , said villefort , in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods , and of which they can not , or will not , divest themselves in society , sir , the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks .: 78.38
<S> then d artagnan , as the reader , from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune , very well knows d artagnan was not a millionaire ; he hoped to become one someday , but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant .: 55.15
<S> that s it , said the tutor .: 11.21
<S> monsieur , you appear to be in great haste ? no one can be more so , monsieur . i am sorry for that , said d artagnan ; for as i am in great haste likewise , i wish to beg you to render me a service . what ? to let me sail first . that s impossible , said the gentleman ; i have traveled sixty leagues in forty hours , and by tomorrow at midday i must be in london . i have performed that same distance in forty hours , and by ten o clock in the morning i must be in london . very sorry , monsieur ; but i was here first , and will not sail second . i am sorry , too , monsieur ; but i arrived second , and must sail first . the king s service ! said the gentleman .: 31.90
<S> i will show you the way , and he went in first .: 17.77
<S> then tis i who am mistaken , for you have always been a good chronologist .: 47.60
<S> i address myself , therefore , first to the benevolence of your majesty , that i may know what has become of my friends , reserving to myself , if necessary , the right of appealing hereafter to your justice . sir , replied anne , with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence , this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns !: 51.26
<S> monsieur de tre ville awaits monsieur d artagnan , cried a servant , throwing open the door of the cabinet .: 21.21
<S> how comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat , receding , serpent like forehead , round , vulture shaped head , and sharp hooked nose , like the beak of a buzzard ?: 139.74
<S> it is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are , answered the wounded man .: 35.26
<S> 20 the performance of the civil marriage .: 143.49
<S> coupe , thirty five francs . . . 35 .: 225.82
<S> it was my forgetfulness then ; pardon me . now , asked athos , what are we to do with ourselves till evening ?: 45.15
<S> why the devil does that foolish girl , who pretends to wish to speak to me , not come into my study ?: 47.95
<S> then , at least turn the gem inside , you silly fellow ; for everybody must be aware that a cadet from gascony does not find such stones in his mother s jewel case . you think , then , i have something to dread ? asked d artagnan .: 63.55
<S> if you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund .: 14.15
<S> villefort , who did not choose to reveal the whole secret , lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure , had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness .: 85.78
<S> a garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization ; and imperceptibly , d artagnan , always in the camp , always on horseback , always in garrison , became i know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper .: 99.69
<S> as soon as she perceived him , she cried , you have promised your protection ; you have promised to save me from her anger .: 27.19
<S> dante s waited only to get breath , and then dived , in order to avoid being seen .: 41.88
<S> she had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago .: 53.53
<S> levasseur , who had been suffering under severe illness , made his reappearance in the character of bertram , and , as usual , the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience .: 75.40
<S> luigi vampa . what think you of that ? inquired franz .: 19.62
<S> he could do it in an hour , and how many times had he , for pure pastime , continued in the water for more than twice as long !: 100.21
<S> and shall we take no notice of this incident ? m. de morcerf turned pale , and clenched his hands on the papers he held .: 32.66
<S> there was something so strange in these three words that everybody , except the king , shuddered .: 36.59
<S> as was his custom , d artagnan presented himself at milady s at about nine o clock .: 36.49
<S> see , look at fernand , and follow his example ; he is well behaved ! 0051m fernand , probably excited beyond bearing , pricked by danglars , as the bull is by the bandilleros , was about to rush out ; for he had risen from his seat , and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival , when merce de s , smiling and graceful , lifted up her lovely head , and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes .: 54.16
<S> this is not his writing ! said athos .: 17.88
<S> take care of yourself , and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken of .: 48.96
<S> please to know , monsieur porthos , said she , that my strongbox , the strongbox of a procurator s wife though it may be , is better filled than those of your affected minxes . that doubles the offense , said porthos , disengaging his arm from that of the procurator s wife ; for if you are rich , madame coquenard , then there is no excuse for your refusal . when i said rich , replied the procurator s wife , who saw that she had gone too far , you must not take the word literally .: 48.74
<S> the next morning she found her grandmother in bed ; the fever had not abated , on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability .: 60.52
<S> except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted , and which might interfere , unless he acted with the greatest prudence , with his own career , ge rard de villefort was as happy as a man could be .: 74.22
<S> in the year 1811 i was transferred to piedmont in france .: 41.46
<S> you are almost a boy . i see that you require someone to answer for me ? i admit that would reassure me greatly . do you know athos ? no . porthos ? no . aramis ? no .: 39.57
<S> a boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a stake .: 65.73
<S> silence and fatigue together overcame d artagnan and sleep overtook him also .: 91.46
<S> andrea was gone .: 31.98
<S> will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our men , they will carry you ashore ? the young man answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference , and stepped out of the boat ; the sea immediately rose to his waist .: 36.24
<S> everyone offered his own .: 101.47
<S> i intrust to you certain papers which are at blois ; and in two months and a half , if you do not hear of us , take possession of them .: 38.80
<S> villefort quietly opened a window , saying , it is very warm , and the heat affects m. noirtier . he then returned to his place , but did not sit down .: 37.70
<S> two or three times , even , to the great astonishment of his friends , he had , when aramis allowed some rudimental error to escape him , replaced a verb in its right tense and a noun in its case .: 86.03
<S> from his windows he saw all the visitors who were caught .: 73.76
<S> well ! insisted the count .: 31.61
<S> the wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted , as he approached it ; but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road .: 48.04
<S> when i become quite motionless , cold , and rigid as a corpse , then , and not before , be careful about this , force open my teeth with the knife , pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat , and i may perhaps revive . perhaps ! exclaimed dante s in grief stricken tones .: 73.61
<S> d artagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his finger . chapter xxix .: 66.41
<S> after whitsuntide it would be another thing . there is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction .: 98.09
<S> then she knew that he was one of the friends of m. de tre ville , and consequently , that he belonged body and soul to the king ; which would make him lose a part of his advantage , since when known to milady as he knew her , he played only an equal game with her .: 35.43
<S> on the other side , the crimes , the power , and the infernal genius of milady had more than once terrified him .: 34.71
<S> besides this , he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men , each capable of killing three d artagnans with two musketeers , in short , with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other men .: 80.58
<S> supper was eaten in silence , but not in sadness ; for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of good humor illumined the face of d artagnan .: 42.19
<S> and you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution , now that he has got hold of the king ? on the contrary , i am certain he will do so .: 30.83
<S> but to grieve my father to disturb my grandmother s last moments never ! you are right , said morrel , calmly .: 48.14
<S> caderousse still evaded all pursuit , and i had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate .: 217.64
<S> d artagnan was the youngest of all these men .: 19.78
<S> it was at the brigantine that had left in the morning , and the tartan that had just set sail , that edmond fixed his eyes .: 31.49
<S> d artagnan was radiant with joy and pride .: 15.51
<S> danglars , however , who now made his appearance , accompanied by caderousse , effectually confirmed the report , stating that he had recently conversed with m. morrel , who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la re serve .: 41.61
<S> i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information . and you replied to him with that notion ? nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise ; he was polite to me and i was so to him . but if he be a spy what do you think a spy would be about here ?: 74.71
<S> as for the count , he just touched the dishes ; he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests , and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food .: 50.12
<S> one , however , fell at the duke s feet , and seeing that it was intended for him , he put it into his pocket .: 18.08
<S> a moment , cried d artagnan , making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their half drawn swords .: 56.22
<S> the man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe .: 59.37
<S> so much penetration , so much frankness , created admiration , but did not entirely remove his suspicions .: 75.18
<S> monte cristo wrote : i die , murdered by the corsican benedetto , my comrade in the galleys at toulon , no .: 63.77
<S> you are certainly an extraordinary man , said danglars ; and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich . and to have ideas , added madame danglars .: 39.42
<S> he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board ; and as his orders were always clear , distinct , and easy of execution , his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure .: 64.48
<S> i did not lose sight of him for an instant .: 10.03
<S> we have walked eight paces , whispered d artagnan , and gone up six steps , so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orangery .: 68.43
<S> all london was crowding to the doors of the house .: 25.70
<S> so you like it , you rogue ? so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living . do you see , said caderousse , all my happiness is marred by one thought ? what is that ? that i am dependent on another , i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly . do not let that disturb you , i have enough for two . no , truly ; you may believe me if you will ; at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse . good caderousse ! so much so , that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs . yes , you wished to speak to me ; but was it indeed remorse , tell me ? true remorse ; and , besides , an idea had struck me . andrea shuddered ; he always did so at caderousse s ideas .: 59.15
<S> you are , therefore , your own master till seven o clock in the evening ; but at seven o clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses . there ! said planchet .: 27.57
<S> nay , if your excellency is satisfied , it is all that i could wish .: 21.84
<S> d artagnan went last , still shaking his head .: 22.34
<S> while you are fighting if there is a fight , he must flee .: 56.92
<S> is that monsieur ? said d artagnan to himself .: 11.13
<S> think for a moment .: 44.32
<S> zounds ! he said ; i don t suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself ! you are right , my lord duke , answered the officer ; i don t know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table ; and when , added to that , he who does the honors is the grandson of henry iv. , you will , my lord duke , easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys . the duke , in his turn , bowed , and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud , who kept behind la ramee .: 53.73
<S> gentlemen , interrupted albert , i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m. de monte cristo and myself . possibly , possibly , said beauchamp immediately ; but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism , and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life .: 53.99
<S> there seems to be only one thing to do , which is , to send our names to her majesty the queen of england , and if she engages to answer for us i presume we shall be allowed to enter . on hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on , wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than before .: 46.17
<S> this is not a corsican maquis but an english garden ; badly kept , i own , but still you must not calumniate it for that . monsieur , i implore you do not stay there ! i think you are going mad , bertuccio , said the count coldly .: 64.07
<S> with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night ; and then supper , sinbad , hashish , statues , all became a dream for franz .: 84.03
<S> adieu , my lord . adieu , my dear rochefort . ah , monsieur mazarin , monsieur mazarin , said rochefort , leading off his curate , who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue , you will see whether i am too old to be a man of action . it was half past nine o clock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishop s palace to the tower of st. jacques de la boucherie .: 25.59
<S> let us first see , said he , whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it . advancing to the opening , he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight ; then , fitting it into its place , he said : you removed this stone very carelessly ; but i suppose you had no tools to aid you . why , exclaimed dante s , with astonishment , do you possess any ? i made myself some ; and with the exception of a file , i have all that are necessary , a chisel , pincers , and lever . 0201m oh , how i should like to see these products of your industry and patience . well , in the first place , here is my chisel . so saying , he displayed a sharp strong blade , with a handle made of beechwood .: 58.67
<S> on the floor above were similar rooms , with the addition of a third , formed out of the antechamber ; these three rooms were a salon , a boudoir , and a bedroom .: 50.01
<S> and this is all ? said she ; and you stopped there ? oh , no , said villefort ; i never ceased to search and to inquire .: 29.59
<S> athos and aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on .: 33.06
<S> three days passed thus , during which his prayers were frequent , if not heartfelt .: 44.33
<S> d artagnan , porthos and aramis uttered a cry of joy .: 6.26
<S> has morrel , whom we know , been killed ?: 68.15
<S> in his escape alone , apart from his plans for the future , which , it must be admitted , were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain , there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart .: 59.52
<S> it was only a precaution .: 22.03
<S> behind them , by another outlet , a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight .: 55.36
<S> we still have five minutes , replied mousqueton .: 36.44
<S> that is the most happy and brilliant evening of my life !: 51.44
<S> yes , i understand . my lord observes that there will be enough to go around . we shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope , replied the duke .: 41.34
<S> by the baroness he was most graciously welcomed , while euge nie received him with her accustomed coldness .: 73.85
<S> it follows from this , that the king s attorney , be he who he may , with whom i should have to deal , would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should . that is to say , replied villefort with hesitation , that human nature being weak , every man , according to your creed , has committed faults . faults or crimes , responded monte cristo with a negligent air .: 47.61
<S> i am in the power of men upon whom i can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite ; they know me by heart , and are steeled against all my weapons .: 67.72
<S> we should be very hard to please , madam , returned albert , did we not think him delightful .: 54.37
<S> a friend , a friend ! said peppino ; but where is the captain ? there , said the sentinel , pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt , hollowed out of the rock , the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched openings .: 32.49
<S> have i not been there once ? yes ; but at that period we were not at war .: 29.89
<S> an hour of terror elapsed , for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back .: 63.30
<S> he had seen in his province that land in which heads become so easily heated a few of the preliminaries of duels ; but the daring of these four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in gascony .: 69.82
<S> de saint me ran , whose sole heiress i am .: 35.85
<S> he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines , and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him .: 125.72
<S> coquenard was in the dilemma of harpagan .: 45.66
<S> but i assure you , mother , i have a strong intention of defending my person , and i never felt half so strong an inclination to live as i do now . merciful heavens ! besides , mother , why should you make up your mind that i am to be killed ?: 31.15
<S> d artagnan determined upon his course .: 24.28
<S> one plays with anybody ; but one fights only with equals . and that is but just , said athos , and he took aside the one of the four englishmen with whom he was to fight , and communicated his name in a low voice .: 47.52
<S> danglars looked at the two men , one after the other , the one brutalized by liquor , the other overwhelmed with love .: 32.56
<S> die ! cried mademoiselle paulet , bitterly , he !: 53.00
<S> here is a glass with one already prepared , said villefort , entering the room .: 41.89
<S> you should install yourself here , and cheer my solitude .: 89.16
<S> louis xiii .: 12.19
<S> raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him , and remembering the recommendation of athos , he , with the rapidity of lightning , made his horse rear as the shot was fired .: 40.04
<S> he turned .: 25.47
<S> we might start at five o clock and be in time , but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night , and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infidels .: 61.17
<S> i was induced to marry her about three years ago , although she had but very little dowry , because monsieur laporte , the queen s cloak bearer , is her godfather , and befriends her . well , monsieur ? asked d artagnan .: 42.36
<S> i think you hailed me , mademoiselle julie ? said he .: 23.89
<S> your death ? said he ; oh , no , you are too charming a mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus , after i have had the happiness to possess you only a single time .: 33.71
<S> morrel hesitated to advance ; he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw .: 55.06
<S> major cavalcanti , a worthy patrician of lucca , a descendant of the cavalcanti of florence , continued monte cristo , reading aloud , possessing an income of half a million . monte cristo raised his eyes from the paper , and bowed .: 36.32
<S> if her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment , in favor of her august husband , the court of france .: 50.34
<S> the porter was not yet gone to bed .: 18.65
<S> the investigation would begin at eight o clock that evening in the committee room , and if postponement were necessary , the proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour .: 58.27
<S> it was not possible , as he knew well , to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of henry iv. , especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age .: 33.58
<S> bernouin shut the door and went away .: 25.47
<S> and is it your cook who prepares these pills ? asked beauchamp .: 64.22
<S> his plan is very simple .: 23.15
<S> he followed m. d e pinay , saw him enter , afterwards go out , and then re enter with albert and cha teau renaud .: 29.49
<S> oh , beauchamp , beauchamp , how shall i now approach mine ?: 51.25
<S> a ground floor , ornamented with arabesques , bathing its terraces in the water , and another floor , looking on the lake , was all which was visible to the eye .: 73.53
<S> come and rejoin me ; bring with you the whole army .: 70.14
<S> we have a rendezvous , you remember , at the place royale . ah !: 25.87
<S> any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg license as specified in paragraph 1.e.1 .: 12.40
<S> meanwhile , emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count : oh , count , how could you , hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor , seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his memory , how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us ?: 76.94
<S> whilst all this was going on , a cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching .: 49.06
<S> i have at length , then , intelligence of you .: 38.10
<S> have you any other guests in your house ? inquired he .: 17.49
<S> if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement , you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.e.8 .: 17.36
<S> now , said morrel , do you wish me to retire ? yes . without seeing mademoiselle valentine ? yes . morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey .: 15.80
<S> god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred , but not without many regrets ; he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause .: 129.23
<S> but now i am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness , since not only your letter but your servant assures me that i have the good fortune to be beloved by you .: 37.34
<S> this traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his commands . they set out on vulcan and bayard , followed by mousqueton on phoebus , and arrived at the palais royal at about a quarter to seven .: 87.80
<S> it was evident he had his orders .: 19.03
<S> it is well , said monte cristo .: 5.90
<S> the next day m. noirtier sent for the notary ; the first will was torn up and a second made , in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine , on condition that she should never be separated from him .: 38.25
<S> you do not know the italian nobility ; the cavalcanti are all descended from princes . have they any fortune ? an enormous one . what do they do ? try to spend it all .: 76.25
<S> the avenger .: 50.91
<S> he is saved !: 21.07
<S> the me le e became general , but strength was on the side of the musketeers .: 139.53
<S> we have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below , which even reached him in his seclusion , and to the guns , the firing of which resounded through that room .: 59.14
<S> yet , continued the count , becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow , which merce de s had accepted , yet , it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength ; it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love , or rather delirium .: 77.24
<S> no ; but gaetano did , i thought . gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance , he had not then spoken to anyone . and if this person be not a smuggler , who is he ? a wealthy signor , who travels for his pleasure . come , thought franz , he is still more mysterious , since the two accounts do not agree . what is his name ? if you ask him , he says sinbad the sailor ; but i doubt if it be his real name . sinbad the sailor ? yes . and where does he reside ? on the sea . what country does he come from ? i do not know . have you ever seen him ? sometimes . what sort of a man is he ? your excellency will judge for yourself . where will he receive me ? no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of . have you never had the curiosity , when you have landed and found this island deserted , to seek for this enchanted palace ? oh , yes , more than once , but always in vain ; we examined the grotto all over , but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening ; they say that the door is not opened by a key , but a magic word . decidedly , muttered franz , this is an arabian nights adventure . his excellency waits for you , said a voice , which he recognized as that of the sentinel .: 52.59
<S> i shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours .: 60.94
<S> i pardon you , and i weep for you .: 17.97
<S> not a word was spoken , everyone seemed occupied , franz with his disembarkment , the sailors with their sails , the smugglers with their goat ; but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other .: 62.48
<S> no , god forbid , said the cardinal ; only , at what hour was he with you ? oh , as to that i can speak positively , your eminence ; for as he came in i remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock , although i had believed it to be later . at what hour did he leave your ho tel ? at half past ten an hour after the event . well , replied the cardinal , who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of tre ville , and who felt that the victory was escaping him , well , but athos was taken in the house in the rue des fossoyeurs . is one friend forbidden to visit another , or a musketeer of my company to fraternize with a guard of dessessart s company ? yes , when the house where he fraternizes is suspected . that house is suspected , tre ville , said the king ; perhaps you did not know it ? indeed , sire , i did not .: 40.67
<S> a real father ? yes , so long as he pays me you ll honor and believe him that s right .: 82.10
<S> nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness !: 151.59
<S> grimaud , my good grimaud ! exclaimed raoul here you are at last !: 75.83
<S> there was no more to do in the room , so the poisoner retired stealthily , as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps ; but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain , absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death , so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust .: 64.94
<S> chevalier , take my hand ; it is that of a friend who will love you to his last sigh . aramis stooped to kiss the king s hand , but charles clasped his and pressed it to his heart .: 41.39
<S> madame , replied monte cristo gravely , and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down julie s cheeks , had lord wilmore seen what i now see , he would become attached to life , for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind ; and he held out his hand to julie , who gave him hers , carried away by the look and accent of the count .: 62.45
<S> for my part , i think what they say is very well said , and quite worthy of two gentlemen . when you please , monsieur , said athos , putting himself on guard .: 28.85
<S> farewell . he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head .: 23.21
<S> mazarin again .: 72.32
<S> thus , then , you will take this bag , and you will go away without being too malcontent . i go away enchanted . farewell , then , or rather , au revoir , for i hope we shall meet again . whenever monseigneur wishes , i am always at at his eminence s orders . that will be frequently , i assure you , for i have found something extremely agreeable in your conversation . oh !: 43.38
<S> i am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy ; when it comes to its height i shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead , uttering neither sigh nor groan .: 89.41
<S> it appears , said the baron , seating himself in the armchair opposite that occupied by milady , and stretching out his legs carelessly upon the hearth , it appears we have made a little apostasy ! what do you mean , sir ! i mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion .: 52.97
<S> certainly these are questions that , in your place , i should like to have answered . my dear franz , replied albert , when , upon receipt of my letter , you found the necessity of asking the count s assistance , you promptly went to him , saying , my friend albert de morcerf is in danger ; help me to deliver him . was not that nearly what you said ? 20222m it was . well , then , did he ask you , who is m. albert de morcerf ?: 49.49
<S> it is something to be well received .: 29.19
<S> well ?: 23.82
<S> and perhaps , my god ! added he , with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him , perhaps sooner than you wish . half past seven had sounded .: 46.57
<S> alas , madame , said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner , i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable . and do you suppose this will be forgotten ? everything will be forgotten , madame , said villefort .: 34.82
<S> read it . obeying the queen , athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen , in which king charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of france would be accorded him .: 65.68
<S> oh , dear , no , your excellency !: 22.05
<S> i recognized him when the wind blew upon his cloak . the devil ! said athos , musingly .: 34.43
<S> do not touch the axe , said the king , and resumed his speech .: 21.45
<S> i yesterday engaged a servant , who had just left m. de villefort i intend sending him away tomorrow , for he eats so enormously , to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in that house .: 63.03
<S> you are , indeed , the most beautiful and most noble woman i ever saw ! dear child ! said merce de s , endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her eye .: 28.21
<S> keep the 50,000 francs you have left i give them to you .: 37.04
<S> now , said athos , that we can not even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us , let us go and see the king s entrance . they had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the king s arrival .: 53.11
<S> everyone , therefore , ran to the court ; some to witness the sight , others to comment upon it .: 78.25
<S> he was like a soldierly automaton , or rather , like a magnificent marionette .: 44.28
<S> it is no doubt the same , said he .: 12.95
<S> the ante rooms were still full of soldiers , the passages still lined by guards .: 126.24
<S> go on , go on , said he , between his teeth , expend your ardor the first day ; to morrow , instead of journeying twenty leagues , you will travel ten , the day after to morrow , five , and in three days you will be in bed .: 35.75
<S> i do not see here , she said , anything but general conditions ; the interests of the prince de conti or of the ducs de beaufort , de bouillon and d elbeuf and of the coadjutor , are herein consulted ; but with regard to yours ? we do ourselves justice , madame , even in assuming the high position that we have .: 71.54
<S> in the month of july ?: 36.96
<S> it was the advice of athos to go straight to the minister .: 17.72
<S> tis well , said porthos , we shall remember that ; but see , there is a postscript from aramis . so there is , said d artagnan , and he read : we conceal the place where we are , dear friends , knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it . confound it , interrupted porthos , with an explosion of passion which sent mousqueton to the other end of the room ; are they in danger of dying ? d artagnan continued : athos bequeaths to you raoul , and i bequeath to you my revenge .: 45.11
<S> people , in general , he said , only ask advice not to follow it ; or if they do follow it , it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given it . porthos arrived a minute after d artagnan .: 49.60
<S> of the evil you have done , said the voice .: 21.15
<S> without doubt ; aramis is one of my best friends . aramis !: 38.90
<S> at the end of the piece e tienne entered , and announced to euge nie that the horses were to the carriage , and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits .: 23.65
<S> i hope that you will sometimes , too , think of me , and if at certain hours you should miss me , if you should feel any slight regret at my absence , i shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself , and that i have been able to prove them to you whilst i had the happiness of living with you . after finishing this letter raoul felt more composed ; he looked well around him to see if olivain and the host might not be watching him , whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper , a mute and touching caress , which the heart of athos might well divine on opening the letter .: 62.35
<S> now mazarin was alone and defenceless , as he well knew .: 72.63
<S> i have my plan .: 21.21
<S> d artagnan declined all others , being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority .: 59.32
<S> that workmanship is divine ! he exclaimed .: 52.26
<S> a moment later friquet went out , carrying in his hand a large leather bag ; he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold .: 39.62
<S> in half an hour . the young man bowed .: 18.79
<S> everything is best in its time , monseigneur .: 46.24
<S> if you refuse this right you may kill me , but i shall not fight . it is but fair , said porthos and aramis , hoping he would choose one of them .: 31.69
<S> oh , fear nothing , said the skipper , showing his face .: 37.14
<S> however , i have managed to live thirty years without this protection , you will say ; but i will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning .: 49.02
<S> for the pleasure of a meeting with you i would go to the end of the world . very well , to morrow , sir . i shall rely on it .: 22.86
<S> international donations are gratefully accepted , but we can not make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states .: 42.35
<S> but is he really a prince ? i will not answer for it , said monte cristo .: 14.40
<S> you will not reply , however , and these gentlemen , i am sure , will presently be of my opinion . aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence .: 25.85
<S> the chief approached , and it was indeed planchet ; d artagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant .: 28.53
<S> monsieur bazin , said friquet , monsieur maillard you know who he is , he gives holy water at saint eustache well , go on . well , he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head .: 57.26
<S> impossible , impossible ! but what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand , the acceptance receipted the splendid diamond .: 103.86
<S> it seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground , and his eyes on the count of morcerf .: 18.74
<S> yes !: 18.78
<S> it is an axiom of criminal law , and , consequently , you understand its full application . 30031m sir , continued villefort , there is something to fear besides death , old age , and madness .: 49.18
<S> in order to see the queen , said aramis , we must first see the cardinal ; and when we have seen the cardinal remember what i tell you , athos we shall be reunited to our friends , but not in the way you wish .: 29.10
<S> the treasure chapter 19 .: 25.90
<S> nothing ! my faith !: 34.18
<S> how do you do , madame dante s ? merce de s courtesied gravely , and said that is not my name , and in my country it bodes ill fortune , they say , to call a young girl by the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband .: 44.05
<S> to the boat !: 28.11
<S> he feared , then , to see her too often .: 43.86
<S> at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door .: 20.27
<S> now , as upon this audience , in his gascon imagination , depended his future life , he saluted aramis and porthos politely , declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms , and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery .: 54.48
<S> d artagnan opened the letter and read as follows : this is the third time i have written to you to tell you that i love you .: 16.56
<S> we will charge upon you , then , said he , if you disobey . there are five of them , said athos , half aloud , and we are but three ; we shall be beaten again , and must die on the spot , for , on my part , i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man . athos , porthos , and aramis instantly drew near one another , while jussac drew up his soldiers .: 35.59
<S> lastly , her hair , which , from being light in her youth , had become chestnut , and which she wore curled very plainly , and with much powder , admirably set off her face , in which the most rigid critic could only have desired a little less rouge , and the most fastidious sculptor a little more fineness in the nose .: 74.29
<S> in the meantime , the mousetrap continued in operation , and likewise d artagnan s vigilance .: 28.64
<S> in the middle of the choir the body of the victim , clothed in her novitiate dress , was exposed .: 28.81
<S> in that case we are as well off as we wish . and yet , said porthos , i would like to know what grimaud is about . silence , porthos ! said aramis .: 24.03
<S> as soon as the siege is over , we ll carry her off from that convent . but we must first learn what convent she is in . that s true , said porthos .: 35.04
<S> and pray , asked franz , where are these pistols , blunderbusses , and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage ? not out of my armory , for at terracina i was plundered even of my hunting knife .: 95.29
<S> can you believe so ? said porthos , protruding his lips with contempt .: 24.32
<S> dante s eyes sparkled with joy , and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple , yet apparently so certain to succeed .: 37.24
<S> keep watch from seven to nine .: 161.15
<S> i arose .: 32.58
<S> i will not acknowledge a crime in my house ; for when crime enters a dwelling , it is like death it does not come alone . listen .: 70.31
<S> as soon as the escort arrived in a city , when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret , where they neither drank nor played ; they only conversed in a low voice , looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them .: 65.86
<S> this same person , with almost incredible patience and perseverance , had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt .: 111.95
<S> the host replied that he had no other worthy of their excellencies ; but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber , each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground .: 49.19
<S> i know a clever person at tours aramis stopped on seeing athos smile .: 131.74
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> pray observe , that i too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or title .: 98.66
<S> who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of m !: 106.70
<S> hold !: 61.43
<S> milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak ; therefore she knew him .: 26.82
<S> ecco ! said the guide , and pushing danglars into the cell , he closed the door upon him .: 41.94
<S> no , divided as we now are , we must perish .: 41.79
<S> i carried the infection of crime with me , and she has caught it as she would the typhus fever , the cholera , the plague !: 96.51
<S> four wretched fares , and twenty sous over , making in all seven francs , are all that i have earned , and i ought to take ten to the owner . will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have ? with pleasure , sir ; twenty francs are not to be despised .: 61.97
<S> i did all in my power to discover the murderers , but no one durst tell me their names , so much were they dreaded .: 68.68
<S> address yourself to m. humann , section of the indirect contributions , corridor a. , no .: 228.32
<S> oh , woe to me ! yes ; you are now on the right path , said the count , crossing his arms over his broad chest ; search search ! but what have i done to you ? exclaimed villefort , whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity , in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality ; what have i done to you ?: 55.12
<S> it is too late .: 11.35
<S> no , you have not ; well , you are right , for if you indulged in such reflections , you would never risk your principal , which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized man .: 69.06
<S> provided charles is dead , it is the axe , not the man , we must thank . and yet , without the man , the king would have been rescued . cromwell smiled .: 59.82
<S> the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns , and he had , besides , the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father s death .: 34.71
<S> my god , said she , what a senseless fanatic !: 28.40
<S> when the chancellor appeared , the king had already gone out by another door .: 30.17
<S> unfortunately he was in a bad vein ; he lost all , together with twenty five pistoles for which he had given his word .: 45.31
<S> d artagnan , on his part , had gained the summit of all his wishes .: 16.60
<S> you know , said the queen , that they want to take the king away from me ? alas !: 21.45
<S> d artagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing .: 27.22
<S> but the abbess , on her part , maintained a reserve still more prudent , contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his eminence .: 67.63
<S> what people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth ? my fifty recruits from the chevalier d humieres , who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks . and where are you going ? to the house of one of my friends , a sculptor , only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble . very good , said gondy , shaking rochefort by the hand , who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him .: 66.14
<S> but now hasten on board , i will join you there ere long . so saying , the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies , and proceeded in the direction of the palais de justice .: 37.97
<S> so that i have no society ; i live alone ; i am sick of it my mind preys on itself . d artagnan smiled .: 51.50
<S> did you ever suffer from a strain , athos ? never !: 51.54
<S> as for you , who are young and active , delay not on my account , but fly go i give you back your promise . it is well , said dante s .: 41.63
<S> his fine eyes , no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly , seemed larger , more liquid than ever .: 153.43
<S> yes , i. and why you ? because i alone know what ? that he is far from being , or rather having been , so guilty toward you as he appears . indeed ! said milady , in an anxious tone ; explain yourself , for i really can not tell what you mean . and she looked at d artagnan , who embraced her tenderly , with eyes which seemed to burn themselves away .: 43.97
<S> pray , was danglars acquainted with fernand ? no yes , he was .: 89.59
<S> at ten o clock in the evening , it is well known , the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented .: 28.60
<S> in a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted ; besides , perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress .: 38.18
<S> in one was depicted the illustrious coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from cardinal bentivoglio , whose servant he had been ; another , the illustrious mazarin acting the part of ignatius loyola in a tragedy of that name ; a third , the illustrious mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from monsieur de chavigny , who had expected to have it ; a fourth , the illustrious coxcomb mazarin refusing to give laporte , the young king s valet , clean sheets , and saving that it was quite enough for the king of france to have clean sheets every three months . the governor , of course , thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner .: 71.38
<S> athos arrested !: 179.04
<S> under that pretense you run against me !: 69.07
<S> he prayed , and prayed aloud , no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice , for he fell into a sort of ecstasy .: 26.07
<S> but you , my friend are you not going to change your dress ? no , i shall go as i am .: 22.51
<S> on the same day the treaty of paris was signed , and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care .: 29.63
<S> my dear count , we have only just begun . what induces you to think so ? the knowledge that i have of the queen s heart ; she will not rest contented beaten . is she , then , preparing for a stroke ? i hope so . come , let us see what you know . i know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the army . ah !: 41.09
<S> he laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards . i am aware of that , and i have told him a hundred times that he was wrong .: 42.15
<S> international donations are gratefully accepted , but we can not make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states .: 42.35
<S> anne of austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinal his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur .: 62.03
<S> leave all to me ; and tomorrow , when you awake , you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied . my dear albert , said franz , leave all to our host ; he has already proved himself full of resources ; let us dine quietly , and afterwards go and see l italienne a alger ! agreed , returned albert ; but remember , signor pastrini , that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for . the host again assured them they might rely on him , and that their wishes should be attended to ; upon which franz and albert mounted to their apartments , and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes .: 67.61
<S> it is a quarter of an hour s journey from here to the city , consequently a quarter of an hour s journey from the city to hither .: 21.57
<S> who calls richelieu calls satan . hold your tongue , hold your tongue , madame !: 67.57
<S> madame danglars , with tearless eyes , but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion , placed the bank notes in her bag , put the certificate and check into her pocket book , and then , standing pale and mute , awaited one kind word of consolation .: 83.21
<S> it is my will , morrel .: 21.65
<S> exactly . and you have that letter of the cardinal ? said d artagnan .: 21.14
<S> valentine had raised herself upon her elbow , and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm ; then , trembling , agitated , and her heart beating with indescribable terror , she awaited the event .: 37.59
<S> by means of the two windows looking into the street , albert could see all that passed ; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men , who always want to see the world traverse their horizon , even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare .: 63.56
<S> raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded , and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand .: 42.34
<S> he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding , seeing he came to mine .: 58.47
<S> ah , now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of isis , in which i am not initiated .: 36.37
<S> let us drink heartily , and while we do so , tell me a little of what is going on in the world yonder . chapter xxvii .: 34.48
<S> the minister , so feared , so hated by his master , has descended into the tomb , drawing after him the king , whom he would not leave alone on earth , lest his work should be destroyed .: 58.37
<S> milady s robe was not the less stained with blood in a second .: 47.53
<S> i spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place ; then my strength gave out and i fainted again . and now how are you feeling ? very ill , replied the wounded man .: 59.61
<S> and in whose behalf are you looking for them ? you are in no doubt on that score . that is true . unfortunately , i have no idea where they are . and you have no way to get news of them ?: 29.25
<S> that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance , said the count in a tone of disgust , as he shut up his glass into its ivory case .: 43.08
<S> good morning , lucien , good morning , said albert ; your punctuality really alarms me .: 73.69
<S> lord de winter , on quitting d artagnan , gave him his sister s address .: 17.34
<S> my misgivings had been but too true .: 53.41
<S> where you please , my dear child . come , then . and kitty , who had not let go the hand of d artagnan , led him up a little dark , winding staircase , and after ascending about fifteen steps , opened a door .: 34.86
<S> what were you saying to this youngster ? my lord , replied guitant , i was observing that we live in troublous times and that to day s events are very like those in the days of the ligue , of which i heard so much in my youth .: 44.54
<S> athos remained alone in the vast chamber , where , according to the cardinal s directions , he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman .: 31.56
<S> now , m. le procureur du roi , said morrel with increasing vehemence , no mercy is allowed ; i denounce the crime ; it is your place to seek the assassin . the young man s implacable eyes interrogated villefort , who , on his side , glanced from noirtier to d avrigny .: 38.13
<S> the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the river .: 24.48
<S> mousqueton had a magnificent livery , and enjoyed the satisfaction of which he had been ambitious all his life that of standing behind a gilded carriage .: 86.32
<S> he had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort .: 20.08
<S> she directed her course towards the faubourg saint germain , went down the rue mazarine , and stopped at the passage du pont neuf .: 39.15
<S> now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration ; for that which almost proved that he was the son of richelieu was his everlasting pretension ; he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows , thin lips , hooked nose , and prominent cheek bones of grimaud were favorable signs .: 133.83
<S> you will find , in the same way , four relays on your route .: 35.76
<S> from m. beauchamp , replied florentin .: 70.12
<S> she had almost all the honors of the quadrille , and if she were envious of the count of san felice s daughter , we will not undertake to say that carmela was not jealous of her .: 27.75
<S> the air they breathed was heavy , damp , and cold .: 70.03
<S> make use of it , then , whenever you think it will be most useful , for my eldest son s welfare .: 48.90
<S> let s be merciful to every sinner !: 231.78
<S> in going up to the target morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the count s pistol .: 62.16
<S> i swear by don t waste time in swearing , said d artagnan ; let us gallop , if our horses will consent . and the travelers buried their rowels in their horses flanks , who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies .: 71.90
<S> as the door opened , the sound of a guzla reached the ears of the young men , but was almost immediately lost , for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter .: 58.45
<S> the fourth , as we have said , was dead .: 14.66
<S> now , continued carlini , if i have done wrongly , avenge her ; and withdrawing the knife from the wound in rita s bosom , he held it out to the old man with one hand , while with the other he tore open his vest .: 39.20
<S> i was at the house of monte cristo an hour since , said morrel ; we were speaking , he of the sorrow your family had experienced , and i of your grief , when a carriage rolled into the courtyard .: 47.37
<S> it appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its weight .: 50.30
<S> why , edmond dante s and myself were intimate friends ! exclaimed caderousse , whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbe fixed on him , while the clear , calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny .: 72.93
<S> he looked at d artagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on raoul one of those strange smiles , of which children are so proud when they receive them .: 43.64
<S> ma foi , captain , replied the sentry , i do not know ; for the last hour i have not heard him stir . come in , your excellency , said vampa .: 21.26
<S> i shall wait for you here till seven . the young man bent low , with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled , and retired in order to saddle his horse .: 31.80
<S> with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him , from lens as far as vimy .: 87.30
<S> moreover , great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd ; every opinion was openly expressed and chorused , so to speak , of coming insurrection , as the thousand bells of all the paris churches rang out the te deum .: 159.15
<S> since that time , monsieur , nobody entered his chamber but his servant . what !: 66.32
<S> what is the meaning of that noise ? oh , my god ! cried morrel , turning pale , what is it ? a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily , and half stifled sobs .: 26.25
<S> undoubtedly the call came from faria s dungeon .: 61.38
<S> i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him ; but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits .: 117.71
<S> host , said he , could you not contrive to get rid of this frantic boy for me ?: 35.83
<S> and with her left hand seizing the thick mass , which her long fingers could scarcely grasp , she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors , and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair , which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat .: 62.58
<S> all my researches have been useless .: 49.57
<S> do not surrender , egad !: 39.59
<S> exactly so ; a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello .: 21.18
<S> then put down three hundred livres , said the procurator s wife , with a sigh .: 19.50
<S> this is the last judge ; that is all .: 21.56
<S> a fortnight after i was at rogliano , and i said to assunta : console thyself , sister ; israel is dead , but he is avenged . she demanded what i meant , and when i had told her all , giovanni , said she , you should have brought this child with you ; we would have replaced the parents it has lost , have called it benedetto , and then , in consequence of this good action , god would have blessed us . in reply i gave her the half of the linen i had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich . what letters were marked on the linen ? said monte cristo .: 75.33
<S> hurrah !: 63.42
<S> when i need your assistance , and the moment arrives , i will come to you , count . well , i rely upon your promise .: 33.80
<S> the first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the prince de conde , with the princess and dowager princess .: 33.27
<S> then dante s departed for genoa .: 55.41
<S> no .: 17.05
<S> amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you ; our chimborazo is mortmartre , our himalaya is mount vale rien , our great desert is the plain of grenelle , where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans .: 172.70
<S> it was a signal .: 19.25
<S> apropos , if you fire and you will do so , for you are recommended to a young general who is very fond of powder remember that in single combat , which often takes place in the cavalry , never to fire the first shot .: 92.98
<S> before the sleeping king they will be mute , gentle and timid as lambs . go , laporte , said the queen .: 51.72
<S> all the corps rivaled one another in audacity and gaiety .: 91.82
<S> the secret is , said athos , that i saw milady last night . d artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips ; but at the name of milady , his hand trembled so , that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents . you saw your wi hush ! interrupted athos .: 49.08
<S> death is about to return to the tomb , the phantom to retire in darkness . what do you say , edmond ? i say , since you command me , merce de s , i must die . die ?: 28.68
<S> this evening m. coquenard is going to the house of the duc de chaulnes , who has sent for him .: 21.23
<S> possibly , continued aramis , came toward me , accompanied by five or six men who followed about ten paces behind him ; and in the politest tone , monsieur duke , said he to me , and you madame , continued he , addressing the lady on my arm the doctor s niece ? hold your tongue , porthos , said athos ; you are insupportable . will you enter this carriage , and that without offering the least resistance , without making the least noise ? he took you for buckingham ! cried d artagnan .: 36.03
<S> they heard the horsemen pass under the windows .: 35.89
<S> listen , then .: 18.92
<S> which are your windows ? asked he of the count , with as much indifference as he could assume .: 28.56
<S> meanwhile the guests , seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone , prepared to depart , when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment : ah !: 41.90
<S> milady followed him with her eyes , and made a gesture of satisfaction .: 12.05
<S> look ! at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded , took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat , raised it to his lips , and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards .: 42.47
<S> that s because i don t care to leave you the means of corrupting your jailers .: 39.51
<S> well , if you do not go this very instant , i will have you arrested by the queen s orders , and i will have you placed in the bastille which you dread so much . bonacieux fell into a profound reflection .: 31.56
<S> go , sir , said the queen , with her most bewitching smile , go and return at midnight . and d artagnan retired , but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper .: 32.36
<S> ho , there , my friend ! the wounded man heaved a sigh .: 30.60
<S> nevertheless , at eight o clock in the morning the regiment of the queen s guards , commanded by guitant , under whom was his nephew comminges , marched publicly , preceded by drums and trumpets , filing off from the palais royal as far as notre dame , a manoeuvre which the parisians witnessed tranquilly , delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms .: 56.39
<S> i would not lose this opportunity of proving to m. noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me , which i am determined to conquer , whatever they may be , by my devotion . and without listening to villefort he arose , and followed valentine , who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to .: 68.24
<S> two remained with the men in black , who rummaged every place and took all the papers .: 61.66
<S> he made a movement of surprise and said : father , you are very young . men who bear my robe have no age , replied the monk , dryly .: 46.52
<S> the two musketeers arrived in their turn , holding the horses of d artagnan and porthos in their hands .: 15.09
<S> then adieu , valentine ! valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed , as morrel was going away , and passing both her hands through the opening , she clasped and wrung them .: 47.69
<S> they both approached the window , and through a slit in the shutter they saw bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak .: 49.38
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> all at once she uttered a loud cry of joy , and darted toward the door ; she had recognized the voice of d artagnan .: 11.94
<S> being no disciple of cagliostro , i was wholly unable to do this ; so , by way of getting out of the scrape , i said , ask morcerf ; he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends ; whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you . is it not almost incredible , said madame danglars , that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command , should possess so little information ? let me assure you , madame , said lucien , that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal , i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo , whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob .: 61.38
<S> the memory of richelieu annihilates me .: 63.53
<S> the following day dante s presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel , accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres , that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit , upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dante s , residing in the alle es de meilhan , and also a young woman called merce de s , an inhabitant of the catalan village .: 50.00
<S> it was a name that too often resounded in her majesty s ears and too often vibrated in her heart for anne of austria not to recognize it ; yet she remained impassive , looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens , either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth .: 74.24
<S> at the extremity of the building , on the contrary , he saw one of the three windows open .: 14.49
<S> do not think i wish to turn you out , my dear debray , continued danglars ; oh , no , not at all .: 20.37
<S> ah , my dear sir , you will see whether a cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person ! and andrea , gliding through the court like a black shadow , rushed out through the wicket , leaving his comrades , and even the keeper , lost in wonder .: 52.55
<S> i will have him come in , if you really wish it . athos moved toward the door ; the duchess held him back .: 33.79
<S> villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression , then , suddenly , taking it up with a nervous motion , he swallowed its contents at one draught .: 39.63
<S> the supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds ; a boar s ham with jelly , a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce , a glorious turbot , and a gigantic lobster .: 111.50
<S> a note which you will find at home will tell you .: 77.56
<S> panting with loss of breath , he returned to the room he had just left .: 38.14
<S> it is that , then , replied the young man , anxious to find out the truth , it is that , then , i remember as we remember a dream .: 23.30
<S> remember , madame , if our god forbids falsehood , he much more severely condemns suicide . when god sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly , placed between suicide and dishonor , believe me , sir , replied milady , in a tone of deep conviction , god pardons suicide , for then suicide becomes martyrdom . you say either too much or too little ; speak , madame .: 108.81
<S> with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink , and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper : i have no money to pay my bill , but i am not a dishonest man ; i leave behind me as a pledge this pin , worth ten times the amount .: 63.17
<S> as d artagnan pursued his investigations , a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead ; his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish ; his respiration was broken and short .: 49.54
<S> it appears , according to your account , that if by mischance a musketeer is arrested , france is in danger .: 49.72
<S> do you hear ? said the king .: 6.69
<S> he passed along the same corridor as before , crossed one court , then a second side of a building ; at length , at the gate of the entrance court he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback .: 55.51
<S> d artagnan leaned against the hedge , after having cast a glance behind it .: 22.14
<S> it was that paper you read this morning ; read it again , dante s , and then i will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense . faria , with an air of triumph , offered the paper to dante s , who this time read the following words , traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust : this 25th day of april , 1498 , be ... alexander vi. , and fearing that not ... he may desire to become my heir , and re ... and bentivoglio , who were poisoned , ... my sole heir , that i have bu ... and has visited with me , that is , in ... island of monte cristo , all i poss ... jewels , diamonds , gems ; that i alone ... may amount to nearly two mil ... will find on raising the twentieth ro ... creek to the east in a right line .: 118.67
<S> a bark ! all cried together .: 129.99
<S> d artagnan went straight to the stables ; day was just dawning .: 39.17
<S> a man , wrapped in a cloak , appeared at the door , but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions , and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him .: 33.93
<S> no , said danglars , smiling , they are bonds on the bank of france , payable to bearer .: 36.59
<S> albert seized them with a convulsive hand , tore them in pieces , and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him , he approached the wax light , always kept burning for cigars , and burned every fragment .: 103.10
<S> madame du vallon left things in much disorder ; i am not much of a hand at figures , so that i live almost from hand to mouth . he is afraid i have come to borrow money , thought d artagnan .: 83.06
<S> well , i hope you will make a handsome wedding present the day you marry mademoiselle danglars . i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head . what fortune has she ? but i tell you a million ? andrea shrugged his shoulders .: 38.06
<S> they thought this order did not concern me , sir ; nevertheless , if you wish it , i am ready to go . ah !: 24.92
<S> and now , my good friend , said d artagnan to him , i must invite you to deprive yourself , for my sake , of your hat and cloak . the coachman , as we can well understand , made no resistance ; in fact , he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man ; d artagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets .: 30.22
<S> by that means all our secrets will remain in the family . insolent ! cried milady ; and as if acted upon by a spring , she bounded toward the baron , who awaited her attack with his arms crossed , but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword .: 48.98
<S> gondy bowed respectfully .: 57.62
<S> the good abbess had naturally consented to her request ; and as a commencement , they were to sup together .: 58.22
<S> madame de villefort had no longer any doubt ; all was over she had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish .: 45.18
<S> confidence and love made him a giant .: 138.47
<S> i am tired , cried d artagnan , sitting down .: 10.84
<S> i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs , you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs .: 37.96
<S> and pray what do you call such an action ? but who said it was buried alive ? why bury it there if it were dead ?: 76.99
<S> almost instantly a female head was put out at the window , with two fingers placed upon her mouth , either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss .: 85.54
<S> be it so ! replied d artagnan ; that is exactly what i want . d artagnan , in two steps , was engaged with the foe , whom , according to custom , he attacked impetuously , but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause .: 40.40
<S> morrel passed his hand over his brow ; it seemed to him a dream .: 15.87
<S> yes ; a thousand times , yes ! and who completed it as it now is ? i did .: 50.05
<S> i staked on him . but there were three races , were there not ? yes ; there was the prize given by the jockey club a gold cup , you know and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race . what was it ? oh , shut up ! again interposed some of the audience .: 58.07
<S> this man , whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others , was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty .: 58.39
<S> well , then , the place ? will the place royale suit you ? asked d artagnan .: 18.62
<S> as i told you , my dear morrel , m. de morcerf will kill me . morrel looked at him in utter amazement .: 16.13
<S> he remained on the bench , with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down , exactly on the spot where the guards placed him .: 27.27
<S> expenses on the road , about fifty francs . . 50 .: 101.04
<S> if i had wished to widen the breach between those whom monsieur d herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder , i could have spoken out . what are you meddling with ? cried aramis , pale with anger , suspecting that d artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with madame de longueville .: 58.82
<S> from the comte de la fere , said aramis .: 9.76
<S> pshaw !: 44.68
<S> the emetic ! is it come yet ? no one answered .: 62.64
<S> it is my fault , madame , said raoul .: 8.11
<S> had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy , i should have conducted you to monte cristo ; now , he added , with a sigh , it is you who will conduct me thither .: 33.02
<S> he wished to subdue this woman in his own name ; and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it , he could not make up his mind to renounce it .: 23.59
<S> she was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty , surmounted by a beacon just lighted , and a rock which jutted out .: 51.28
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening , and had gone to bed and to sleep .: 32.31
<S> d artagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber ; the swiss refused by shaking his head , and drew his sword .: 32.31
<S> the first rendezvous was fixed for the following wednesday , at eight o clock in the evening precisely .: 25.48
<S> what !: 14.83
<S> it was mordaunt .: 15.30
<S> and have you done all that is possible , father , to meet this disastrous result ? asked the young man , after a moment s pause .: 24.40
<S> come , let us put aside all rancor and talk pleasantly . there s nothing i wish more , replied mazarin .: 60.81
<S> i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience . i reside in my father s house , but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard , entirely separated from the main building . quite sufficient , replied the count , as , taking out his tablets , he wrote down no .: 60.34
<S> to saddle !: 57.33
<S> you may torture , torment , kill me , but you shall not have my signature again ! as your excellency pleases , said vampa , as he left the cell .: 48.36
<S> i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated .: 38.11
<S> i will answer for it , her resentment will not hold out against such an attention . monsieur cardinal , you know that i do not like worldly pleasures . the queen will only be the more grateful to you , as she knows your antipathy for that amusement ; besides , it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself . we shall see , monsieur cardinal , we shall see , said the king , who , in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about , and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread , was ready to make up all differences with her , we shall see , but upon my honor , you are too indulgent toward her . sire , said the cardinal , leave severity to your ministers .: 51.78
<S> my commands are ordinarily short , clear , and precise ; and i would rather be obliged to repeat my words twice , or even three times , than they should be misunderstood .: 80.43
<S> the deputy procureur du roi in one of the aristocratic mansions built by puget in the rue du grand cours opposite the medusa fountain , a second marriage feast was being celebrated , almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by dante s .: 62.21
<S> i said nothing , for we must have peace in the house ; and 100,000 francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too much .: 70.40
<S> the lady always left first , and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage , it drove away , sometimes towards the right hand , sometimes to the left ; then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave , buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief .: 54.41
<S> my master will go to dinner . and after dinner ? he will sleep an hour . then ? he is going to the opera . are you sure of it ? asked albert .: 24.80
<S> i have not tried to discover her other name . kitty ! cried milady .: 40.73
<S> he is cold , said debray .: 21.93
<S> today i am at your service , replied the count .: 12.65
<S> andrea extended his hand ; bertuccio kept his own in his pocket , and merely jingled a few pieces of money .: 40.55
<S> madame danglars , in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety , had hesitated about going to madame de morcerf s , when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort .: 63.04

<S> bertuccio alone turned pale whenever benedetto s name was mentioned in his presence , but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so .: 86.87
<S> thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words : tomorrow , sir , i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business . and i , sir , said danglars , shall be most happy to receive you . upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the ho tel des princes , if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son .: 36.65
<S> meanwhile m. de villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at m. d avrigny s door .: 47.63

<S> grimaud bowed , but stepped back .: 40.09
<S> but , since you say nothing remains but for m. d e pinay to arrive that the contract may be signed , and the following day you will be his , tomorrow you will be engaged to m. d e pinay , for he came this morning to paris . valentine uttered a cry .: 29.62

<S> meanwhile , oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas . nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency s wish , said the landlord , opening the door of the chamber ; i have caused one to be placed on the landing , close by your apartment . then , taking the tablet from the wall , he handed it to franz , who read as follows : the public is informed that on wednesday , february 23rd , being the first day of the carnival , executions will take place in the piazza del popolo , by order of the tribunal of the rota , of two persons , named andrea rondolo , and peppino , otherwise called rocca priori ; the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest , named don ce sar torlini , canon of the church of st. john lateran ; and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit , luigi vampa , and his band .: 45.51

<S> it was cold and motionless .: 14.13
<S> each of the captains then led his company to the louvre , where the king held his review .: 46.04
<S> after a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt , then looked with great complacency at his hands , which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care ; and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first , as belonging to the uniform , he put on others of silk only .: 83.08
<S> ambushes and violences multiplied around me , but i resisted .: 136.24
<S> my daughter , continued the banker , you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you , who is determined she will not marry ; now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me , who has decided that his daughter shall marry . euge nie bowed , not as a submissive daughter , but as an adversary prepared for a discussion .: 47.43
<S> the day after my return to lille , my brother in his turn succeeded in making his escape ; i was accused of complicity , and was condemned to remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner .: 41.09
<S> he felt himself seized by the hair , then he saw and heard nothing .: 29.25
<S> ah ! said the prince , laughing , i thought we should come to that .: 20.89
<S> she was very beautiful , but her usual pallor had increased ; her eyes were more brilliant than ever , and her hands , which were generally white like mother of pearl , now more resembled wax , to which time was adding a yellowish hue .: 70.49
<S> yes , there is the sky ; here is the sea !: 23.33

<S> laporte , place the king in bed . laporte placed the king , dressed as he was , in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet .: 61.65
<S> the most dreadful misfortunes , the most frightful sufferings , the abandonment of all those who loved me , the persecution of those who did not know me , formed the trials of my youth ; when suddenly , from captivity , solitude , misery , i was restored to light and liberty , and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant , so unbounded , so unheard of , that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs .: 67.42
<S> you do not like dante s ? i never like upstarts . then tell me all you know about the catalane . i know nothing for certain ; only i have seen things which induce me to believe , as i told you , that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the vieilles infirmeries . what have you seen ? come , tell me ! well , every time i have seen merce de s come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall , strapping , black eyed catalan , with a red complexion , brown skin , and fierce air , whom she calls cousin . really ; and you think this cousin pays her attentions ? i only suppose so .: 52.77
<S> the ever new passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those clouds which float in the heavens , reflecting sometimes azure , sometimes fire , sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest , and which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and death .: 113.18
<S> never mind where it comes from , said porthos , let us taste it , and if it is good , let us drink it . no , said athos ; don t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown source . you are right , athos , said d artagnan .: 24.75
<S> planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of d artagnan , and which d artagnan from that time made shift to do without .: 76.36
<S> swear to me , replied faria , to free me if what i tell you prove true , and i will stay here while you go to the spot . are you well fed ? repeated the inspector .: 38.37
<S> they will , no doubt , bleed him ; therefore i will retire , for i can not endure the sight of blood ; and she followed her husband upstairs .: 41.04

<S> the cardinal , as his majesty had said , was really furious , so furious that during eight days he absented himself from the king s gaming table .: 48.90
<S> the tocsin was sounded .: 51.47
<S> i will appeal to any of these gentlemen , could i leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit , as you term him ?: 47.01
<S> i do not understand you ? i mean , merce de s , that you are thus harsh and cruel with me , because you are expecting someone who is thus attired ; but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant , or if he is not , the sea is so to him . fernand , cried merce de s , i believed you were good hearted , and i was mistaken !: 44.45
<S> she is ill !: 41.66
<S> here , your excellency , said peppino , taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the worm eaten table , which with the stool and the goat skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell .: 53.83

<S> the officer entered .: 13.72
<S> remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these doors .: 176.96
<S> how do i know ? replied danglars ; gone , as every prudent man ought to be , to look after his own affairs , most likely .: 57.74
<S> all took their places , or rather the ladies formed a circle , while the gentlemen more indifferent to the restraints of what boileau calls the style e nergique commented on the feverish agitation of andrea , on m. danglars riveted attention , euge nie s composure , and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair .: 122.10
<S> and you disinherit your granddaughter , continued the notary , because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes ? yes . so that , but for this marriage , she would have been your heir ? yes . there was a profound silence .: 35.34
<S> let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel , devoted friends in business , merry companions in our ancient pleasures . and whenever , added athos , we meet in battle , at this word , place royale ! let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right , even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage . you speak charmingly , said porthos .: 75.78
<S> noirtier , seeing barrois in this pitiable condition , showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man .: 76.60
<S> grimaud was still the same , and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior , la ramee , who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself , for , as we have said , la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort .: 31.78
<S> well , of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters , for which we will draw lots .: 46.37
<S> dante s strove to do this with his nails , but they were too weak .: 34.93
<S> armed men , shouldering muskets , watched over the barricades with menacing looks ; words of command , patrols , arrests , executions , even , were encountered at every step .: 161.51
<S> come and open , then ! cried d artagnan to the man with the scythe , taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle .: 30.43
<S> he has taken part against his queen , or rather , against her minister .: 56.22
<S> during the reading of this , which was long , the public attention was continually drawn towards andrea , who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern .: 70.68
<S> one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil , or , at least , have cast down her thickly fringed lashes , so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes ; but , on the contrary , the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say : if you are my friends , rejoice with me , for i am very happy . as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la re serve , m. morrel descended and came forth to meet it , followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled , to whom he had repeated the promise already given , that dante s should be the successor to the late captain leclere .: 59.69
<S> the pope awaited him .: 31.12
<S> pooh ! said porthos , it is always that .: 25.68
<S> the sergeant and his men took possession of the little garden .: 29.36
<S> well , what do you wish me to do for you ? said beauchamp mildly .: 13.52
<S> d artagnan knew what she wanted .: 27.05
<S> he stopped a moment in the anteroom , as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint me ran s ; morrel concealed himself behind a door ; valentine remained motionless , grief seeming to deprive her of all fear .: 47.57
<S> and you did not awaken me ? i wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep , my child ; you must be fatigued from yesterday . oh , sir , how good you are ! athos smiled .: 33.23
<S> he is in a very picturesque place do you know the catacombs of st. sebastian ? i was never in them ; but i have often resolved to visit them . well , here is an opportunity made to your hand , and it would be difficult to contrive a better .: 34.48
<S> in the corridor he met mme .: 22.51
<S> he has such a short neck , said she .: 46.72
<S> the man who lives to see shall see . and slipping through the aperture , he alighted in the court .: 50.47
<S> stay , i think i told my steward yesterday to attend to this ; perhaps i can render you this slight service also . he extended his hand , and rang the bell thrice .: 58.93
<S> locked ! he exclaimed ; these devils of english , how suspicious they are ! locked ! said blaisois ; ah !: 74.12
<S> ah , monsieur ! cried planchet , as soon as he perceived his master , here is more trouble .: 19.74
<S> is that what you wish for ? said barrois .: 22.24
<S> i am not unhappy while i possess my son ! ah , just so , said albert ; here begins the trial .: 50.80
<S> oh , would we could relate it everywhere , and to everyone , so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence . ah , really , said monte cristo in a half stifled voice .: 43.98
<S> either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis , and i will tolerate him , or he must never set his foot again in my house ; do you understand , madame ? oh , this is too much , cried hermine , choking , you are worse than despicable . but , continued danglars , i find you did not even pause there insults ! you are right ; let us leave these facts alone , and reason coolly .: 51.28
<S> you lose ground , you are turning ?: 138.08
<S> if you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship , my sergeant will blow your brains out .: 72.31
<S> with the aid of his pickaxe , dante s , after the manner of a labor saving pioneer , dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it , filled it with powder , then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre .: 65.20
<S> scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her son s room , and inquired from laporte if the king was in bed .: 29.68
<S> what art thou about ?: 75.21
<S> his requests were not granted , but he went on asking all the same .: 51.34
<S> come , come , do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the corsican , who , to my mind , has usurped quite enough . 0085m nay , madame ; i would place each of these heroes on his right pedestal that of robespierre on his scaffold in the place louis quinze ; that of napoleon on the column of the place vendo me .: 84.50
<S> what is he waiting for ? asked another .: 21.68
<S> the prince was said to be in person at bethune .: 42.98
<S> so far as i can judge , i suppose this to be a quarter of my father s revenue . i , said danglars , have always intended giving my daughter 500,000 francs as her dowry ; she is , besides , my sole heiress . all would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing .: 53.56
<S> we will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good , and we will leave a fund of a thousand livres under the guardianship of monsieur abbe here , for extraordinary occasions or common wants .: 105.82
<S> if the emissaries of the cardinal arrive , he will take no notice ; if it is monsieur d artagnan and his friends , he will bring them to us . he knows them , then ? doubtless .: 28.02
<S> athos was standing before the door , enveloped in his cloak , with his hat pulled down over his eyes .: 19.57
<S> one might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye , trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body .: 85.29
<S> it is very evident that it is the letter w which m. noirtier wants , said the notary .: 36.18
<S> i am all that is left to her belonging to my poor rene e , whom you have so soon forgotten , sir . ah , madame , said villefort , you forget that i was obliged to give a mother to my child . a stepmother is never a mother , sir .: 33.16
<S> coward !: 64.32
<S> go and look for the comte de la fere ; i wish to speak with him . aramis found athos and brought him .: 21.36
<S> he went on his way .: 12.19
<S> come this way , gentlemen ; come , m. villefort , for a declaration to be available , should be made before the competent authorities . he then took villefort s arm , and , at the same time , holding that of madame danglars under his own , he dragged the procureur to the plantain tree , where the shade was thickest .: 48.83
<S> yes , yes , said he ; you disturb , you agitate the people who live in the castle . the poor , senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words , while milady was reading with her lynx s eyes the very depths of his heart .: 46.86
<S> he s not a guest like the other one here just now , observed mine host to olivain , who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything , and your young master has no appetite . my master had appetite enough three days ago , but what can one do ?: 94.13
<S> here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate , who was going to the scaffold to die like a coward , it is true , but he was about to die without resistance .: 25.01
<S> d artagnan , said porthos , i must out with it at once , for i can t keep to myself anything i have against you ; i haven t been able to recognize you in this matter . why not ? said d artagnan , with his wise smile .: 34.82
<S> was not your father a bonapartist ? asked monte cristo ; i think i remember that you told me something of that kind . my father has been a jacobin more than anything else , said villefort , carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence ; and the senator s robe , which napoleon cast on his shoulders , only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him .: 44.67
<S> when the young man on board saw this person approach , he left his station by the pilot , and , hat in hand , leaned over the ship s bulwarks .: 50.21
<S> he found a young shepherd watching his flock .: 24.21
<S> the love i have for you is very different from the love i had for my father .: 50.10
<S> there is an excellent tavern at compie gne , well remembered by those who have ever been there .: 42.90
<S> i thought there were four of you . listen to me , sir .: 21.40
<S> as nine o clock sounded , d artagnan was at the place royale .: 14.37
<S> a being was commissioned to arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him . emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell was heard , the well known signal given by the porter that a visitor had arrived .: 69.13
<S> his presence produced a good effect .: 57.79
<S> everything is in readiness for our flight , and we can select any time we choose .: 43.32
<S> they shook their heads .: 26.82
<S> athos was the last to enter .: 21.58
<S> on returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of la pierre , the cardinal found , standing before the house he occupied , d artagnan , without his sword , and the three musketeers armed .: 37.65
<S> do you understand ? perfectly . you will sell this diamond ; you will divide the money into five equal parts , and give an equal portion to these good friends , the only persons who have loved me upon earth . but why into five parts ? asked caderousse ; you only mentioned four persons . because the fifth is dead , as i hear .: 72.74
<S> let us sell the diamond .: 17.03
<S> i speak of that spiteful and intriguing italian of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillow of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison , not daring to kill them , as our great cardinal our cardinal did of the miser , who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear , though he is rich , of losing them at play next morning of the impudent fellow who insults the queen , as they say so much the worse for her and who is going in three months to make war upon us , in order that he may retain his pensions ; is that the master whom you propose to me ?: 86.81
<S> it was indeed planchet and grimaud .: 27.99
<S> hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them .: 94.86
<S> lend me your back but don t let the cardinal go . porthos lent him his back and d artagnan was soon on the summit of the wall , where he seated himself .: 35.71
<S> as he approached it , noirtier s gaze followed him , and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart .: 36.09
<S> but i am not a foreigner , sir , said she , with an accent as pure as ever was heard between portsmouth and manchester ; my name is lady clarik , and this measure this measure is general , madame ; and you will seek in vain to evade it . i will follow you , then , sir . accepting the hand of the officer , she began the descent of the ladder , at the foot of which the boat waited .: 35.54
<S> it was only to fight as an amateur .: 29.10
<S> his secret , then , was in the past , as had often been vaguely said to d artagnan .: 47.53
<S> but this year , continued the horticulturist , i ll take care it shall not happen , even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe . monte cristo had seen enough .: 48.49
<S> once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear .: 277.60
<S> milady had , likewise , the best of passports her beauty , her noble appearance , and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles .: 60.66
<S> well , penelon , said the captain , what makes you shake your head ? why , i says , i still think you ve got too much on . i think you re right , answered he , we shall have a gale . a gale ?: 42.33
<S> well ? asked danglars .: 12.53
<S> i will try and think over what is the best thing to be done ; you will give me your advice , will you not , and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant position ?: 28.25
<S> d artagnan and his friends are detained at the siege of la rochelle . how do you know that ? my brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of musketeers .: 23.23
<S> but why has he waited till now ?: 49.42
<S> he , however , darted not the less quickly toward milady , yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over iron .: 129.87
<S> well , is all said ? all . then let s count our money and divide it .: 169.33
<S> a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain .: 138.54
<S> then a fearful crash was heard ; a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over !: 58.74
<S> she saw a woman in a white dressing gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass .: 51.94
<S> if i were obliged to fight against you , i think i should allow myself to be pierced through and through , for i never loved any one but you in the wide world ; and honest porthos burst into tears as he embraced athos .: 62.45
<S> they would have an easy bargain of four isolated men ; whereas four men together make a troop .: 100.28
<S> the cart must be tastefully ornamented ; and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan reapers , we may get up a striking tableau , after the manner of that splendid picture by le opold robert .: 142.33
<S> no , replied athos , fortunately monsieur d artagnan has only fainted . ah , indeed , so much the better ! said lord de winter .: 14.08
<S> and that was policar morrel , my uncle , who was afterwards a captain .: 67.65
<S> i have , replied d artagnan .: 8.31
<S> therefore , he knew nothing either of the enemy s numbers , or of those in command , or of the purpose of the army .: 43.19
<S> how can i , if her husband fails in controlling her ? asked lucien ; you know the character of the baroness no one has any influence with her , and she does precisely what she pleases . ah , if i were in your place said albert .: 55.85
<S> answer in your turn , or you may repent of your disobedience . king s musketeers , said athos , more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do so .: 52.27
<S> police affairs ! cried the king , taking up tre ville s words , police affairs !: 124.18
<S> this major cavalcanti is an old friend of yours , then ? by no means .: 36.08
<S> the injured man had recovered his senses .: 33.68
<S> you say , then , that the guardsmen sought a quarrel with the musketeers ? i say that it is probable that things have fallen out so , but i will not swear to it , sire .: 29.59
<S> at a shout from the boat , the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were , as dante s knew , in the frioul and outside the inner harbor .: 56.55
<S> no ; a more material interest stirred his blood .: 103.67
<S> they advanced fifty paces farther , and then stopped to open a door , then went forward again .: 32.27
<S> ho !: 16.63
<S> it is the talk of all paris . and you , count , have made this match ? asked beauchamp .: 20.53
<S> i will , in the meantime , go and prepare the young man for this much desired interview , for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself . i should quite imagine that to be the case , said cavalcanti .: 46.02
<S> no , i don t want your help , watch the cardinal . i am watching , said porthos .: 21.31
<S> you are at liberty to speak , m. de morcerf , said the president , as he unsealed the letter ; and the count began his defence , i assure you , albert , in a most eloquent and skilful manner .: 24.81
<S> ma foi , there is no hurry .: 25.14
<S> you , sir , know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of servants . d artagnan smiled ; porthos wanted to lengthen out his names , mousqueton to cut his short .: 88.11
<S> i do not go on because it pleases me to stop here . the cavalier addressed some words in english to his sister .: 54.46
<S> he felt a carpet under his feet , a door opened , perfumes surrounded him , and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes .: 37.82
<S> the pike , eels , and carp eat greedily always , as everybody knows well , they feast on the vulture .: 165.27
<S> she learned drawing , music everything .: 396.78
<S> gondy , who began to feel uneasy , examined the tapestry with his eyes , touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good spanish dagger , which was hidden under his cloak , was well within reach .: 39.69
<S> you look careworn ; really , you alarm me .: 56.68
<S> the evening was employed in discussing the war ; the grooms polished their arms ; the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish , and they awoke in despair , having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle .: 46.85
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> barrois ? said she .: 22.86
<S> at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot ; the veins of the throat swelled ; his cheeks and temples became purple , as though he was struck with epilepsy ; nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry .: 39.06
<S> oh , madame , i do not presume to call myself your friend , but at all times i am your most respectful servant . the countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart , and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes .: 33.96
<S> yes , said the baron , assassinated .: 18.87
<S> mazarin gave , however , no order of the kind , but on the contrary began to be insinuating .: 48.44
<S> what is there i would not do to evince my earnest gratitude ! that is right , cried the marquise .: 36.02
<S> no human being , not even my sister , is aware of its existence .: 74.70
<S> on recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could , of course , tell nothing but what they knew that they had been seized , stripped and bound .: 76.37
<S> see how regularly i live and how easy i am here .: 96.66
<S> valentine promised all that morrel required of her , and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry franz .: 58.13
<S> all that which a man wounded in his self love could let fall in the shape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman porthos let fall upon the bowed head of the procurator s wife .: 87.77
<S> here is the story , monseigneur , resumed the trembling host ; for i now recollect you .: 39.95
<S> the day came at length , and was almost as feverish as the night had been , but it brought reason to the aid of imagination , and dante s was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain .: 42.54
<S> this pretended d artagnan was he not an emissary of the cardinal , whom the cardinal sought to introduce into tre ville s house , to place near him , to win his confidence , and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances ?: 56.25
<S> the door opened , but before it could be closed , the lady exclaimed : oh , lucien oh , my friend ! the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger s name was lucien ; still , as he was the very perfection of a door keeper , he made up his mind not to tell his wife .: 43.25
<S> but your excellency wished to know two things ; what was the second ? the second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor , and the abbe busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at ni mes . the story will be very long , excellency . what matter ?: 41.78
<S> beyond portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts , like a forest of poplars despoiled by the winter , bent with each breath of the wind .: 98.74
<S> yes , he continued , sadly shaking his head , yes , it is as you said , misfortune , indeed , has overtaken us .: 35.24
<S> pah ! but where is your wicker flask , monsieur mousqueton ?: 97.19
<S> d artagnan swept up the money that he and porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket .: 67.36
<S> yes ; if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty , as you are , and who may hope for everything , being handsome and brave , as you are . wretch , cried d artagnan , speak quickly !: 48.67
<S> what !: 14.83
<S> you must do so . certainly , sir ; but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice of god . well then , sire , continued d artagnan , listen to the noise of the people ; you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder . in truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze ; then all at once it ceased .: 36.64
<S> cromwell had two or three of these retreats in london , unknown except to the most intimate of his friends .: 51.26
<S> he was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees , and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk .: 53.68
<S> in the morning , when they entered her chamber she was still in bed .: 18.31
<S> pardon me for having joined with your persecutors . milady held out her hand to him .: 30.91
<S> he believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor : it is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball , for he is doubtless a musketeer apprentice . d artagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him , and fixed his eyes intensely upon the guardsman who had just made this insolent speech .: 49.85
<S> the company went on speaking of the poet voiture .: 90.81
<S> as for me i will give my last sou for it .: 23.84
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> the cardinal had him informed that he would provide for him so that he should never want for anything in future .: 42.89
<S> do you love me still ? ah , madame , said porthos , in the most melancholy tone he could assume , when we are about to enter upon a campaign a campaign , in which my presentiments tell me i shall be killed oh , don t talk of such things ! cried the procurator s wife , bursting into tears .: 31.79
<S> my good friend , said albert , i beg pardon for my intrusion , but i was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not . he is really out , sir , replied baptistin .: 34.45
<S> in his youth d artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military , but he was cured of all those hot headed propensities ; besides , he had the cardinal s hundred pistoles in his pocket , so he went into the hotel without a word .: 49.13
<S> he was nay , probably may still be a bonapartist , and is called noirtier ; i , on the contrary , am a staunch royalist , and style myself de villefort .: 69.41
<S> franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting place , and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides , who , holding torches in their hands , had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum , and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins , resembling , as they glided along , some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui .: 59.24
<S> the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saint jacques .: 21.84
<S> however , i will not go back on my word , and i will give 45,000. at least , replace the diamond in the ring , said la carconte sharply .: 36.55
<S> the spade , perhaps . an exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave digger had found the object of his search .: 70.36
<S> suddenly he arose , lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy , paced twice or thrice round the dungeon , and then paused abruptly by the bed .: 54.09
<S> ah ! said d artagnan , there are two of them , then ! i wish there were four , said athos ; the two parties would then be equal . perhaps there are four , said d artagnan .: 22.08
<S> thrones are at this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of princes .: 117.20
<S> ah , dear constance , i have found you , then ; i see you at last ! and milady stretched out her arms to mme .: 22.59
<S> i bought , said he , the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle ; whereas , on my honor , monsieur de chavigny , though i ve been here a week , has not ordered so much as a tartlet . but , i then replied , probably monsieur de chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good . my pastry not good !: 68.37
<S> all , therefore , of the vast resources of his genius were at work night and day , engaged in listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of europe .: 93.31
<S> yes , buckingham . the woman was english , then ? no , she was french , but she had married in england . the monk turned pale , wiped his brow and went and bolted the door .: 37.88
<S> only we conspire against the rochellais . ah , you gentlemen of policy ! replied the cardinal , knitting his brow in his turn , the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains , if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming . the color mounted to the face of athos , and he made a step toward his eminence .: 48.83
<S> despite these efforts , project gutenberg electronic works , and the medium on which they may be stored , may contain defects , such as , but not limited to , incomplete , inaccurate or corrupt data , transcription errors , a copyright or other intellectual property infringement , a defective or damaged disk or other medium , a computer virus , or computer codes that damage or can not be read by your equipment .: 42.51
<S> ten minutes passed thus , and he was convinced that no one was watching him .: 17.27
<S> bertuccio , said the count , i am very glad to tell you , that while you gesticulate , you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him ; and i have always observed , that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret .: 42.02
<S> at herlier , planchet , who led the column , turned to the left .: 49.19
<S> the elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation , like that of all who have experienced many trials , contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information ; but it was never egotistical , for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows .: 65.61
<S> my very self , dear friend . me , also ! repeated porthos .: 55.42
<S> pray don t heed him , sir ! he only barks , he never bites .: 94.80
<S> it had been handed down from father to son ; for the singular clause of the only will that had been found , had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic , preserved in the family with superstitious veneration .: 93.90
<S> you see in me , such as i am , a person sentenced to be hung . and on what account ? i rescued from the hands of mazarin s police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the bastile , where he had been for five years . will you name him ? oh , you know him well , my lord it is count de rochefort . ah !: 36.60
<S> well , then , since she has left paris , and you are sure of it , d artagnan , nothing prevents me , and i am ready to follow you .: 14.40
<S> help , reverend sir , help ! this mournful appeal pierced the darkness .: 82.67
<S> but what the devil are you about , aramis ? continued athos .: 12.24
<S> why , said aramis , one half were hanged and the other half were shot . well , i , said d artagnan i answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot .: 63.17
<S> certainly !: 44.02
<S> did parliament pass this act ? athos asked of him in english .: 128.00
<S> i know it will serve me as it did when we came over . and to think , said mousqueton , that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer .: 79.50
<S> try again , whispered the count , who depended on the secret spring , which was unknown to the picklock , clever as he might be try again , you have a few minutes work there . and he advanced to the window .: 49.63
<S> let us see , said d artagnan .: 4.74
<S> monsieur abbe , you are a great moralist . doubtless , said aramis , for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed , but moreover , not to fail ; for in case of failure , heads are in question , not for our lackeys speak lower , aramis , said athos .: 68.86
<S> somebody , he perceived , was in the courtyard , moving stealthily .: 106.37
<S> edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning , and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps .: 70.31
<S> now in 86,400 seconds very many things can be done . and how shall i know whether your excellency has succeeded or not . oh , that is very easily arranged .: 52.69
<S> whom pagans and unbelieving gentiles call duke of buckingham , replied milady .: 199.53
<S> are there any magistrates or judges at the cha teau d if ? there are only , said the gendarme , a governor , a garrison , turnkeys , and good thick walls .: 51.13
<S> what makes you believe this ? why , when i found myself utterly destitute , i thought my old friends would , perhaps , assist me .: 48.58
<S> with the deputy s knowledge of crime and criminals , every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence .: 77.62
<S> i am quite ready , said d artagnan ; but in the first place i should like to be certain of one thing . and what is that ? asked milady .: 11.98
<S> the stranger was about to reply ; but at the moment he opened his mouth , d artagnan , who had heard all , precipitated himself over the threshold of the door .: 18.85
<S> however , raoul must be diverted from this fancy .: 87.93
<S> it is a prisoner , said edmond joyfully .: 16.60
<S> after a moment s mournful silence , his heart overflowed , and he gave way to a flood of tears .: 34.51
<S> what !: 14.83
<S> some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages .: 20.10
<S> yes , indeed , said he ; i think i have seen you and known you formerly . yes , caderousse , you have seen me ; you knew me once . who , then , are you ?: 20.80
<S> although master of himself , monte cristo , scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned , and who , distrustful by habit , and especially incredulous as to social prodigies , was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger , as monte cristo was already called , as an adventurer in search of new fields , or an escaped criminal , rather than as a prince of the holy see , or a sultan of the thousand and one nights .: 113.70
<S> athos bowed and obeyed .: 28.40
<S> bravo ! said the captain .: 11.63
<S> his calm , noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head .: 60.66
<S> ah , you call yourself oriental , a levantine , maltese , indian , chinese ; your family name is monte cristo ; sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation , and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue , or rather the chief defect , of us eccentric parisians , that is , you assume the vices you have not , and conceal the virtues you possess . my dear vicomte , returned monte cristo , i do not see , in all i have done , anything that merits , either from you or these gentlemen , the pretended eulogies i have received .: 71.00
<S> oh , send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch ! shall i write your deposition ?: 77.51
<S> the deuce ! cried d artagnan ; do you live in this way always ? yes , pretty well .: 25.75
<S> he would have inquired after them of their mistresses , but he was neither acquainted with porthos s nor aramis s , and as to athos , he had none .: 42.65
<S> now , gentlemen , said d artagnan , go up to your room again ; and in ten minutes , i will answer for it , you shall have all you desire . the englishmen bowed and went upstairs .: 18.46
<S> the night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven o clock at the hotel , and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission .: 46.55
<S> a saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter .: 49.16
<S> i had vague perceptions of space traversed , of the rolling of a carriage , of a horrible dream in which my strength had become exhausted ; but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine , and yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality .: 92.15
<S> make haste and dress yourself . in fact , said franz , this horrible scene has passed away like a dream . it is but a dream , a nightmare , that has disturbed you . yes , that i have suffered ; but the culprit ? that is a dream also ; only he has remained asleep , while you have awakened ; and who knows which of you is the most fortunate ? but peppino what has become of him ? peppino is a lad of sense , who , unlike most men , who are happy in proportion as they are noticed , was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion .: 54.91
<S> after which the curtain again fell , and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon .: 55.42
<S> one day when i was reproaching him for his unavailing searches , and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them , he looked at me , and , smiling bitterly , opened a volume relating to the history of the city of rome .: 54.62
<S> i only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king . ah , you knew that ? said mordaunt .: 23.42
<S> well , i will certainly drink to their health with all my heart , but i will not drink alone . and d artagnan went among those guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others , to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious anjou wine which had been sent him from villeroy .: 65.22
<S> take it , then , and pray disturb us no longer , said madame de villefort , giving the album to edward , who then went towards the door , led by his mother .: 27.45
<S> but the latter went on without pity : seek whom the crime will profit , says an axiom of jurisprudence . doctor , cried villefort , alas , doctor , how often has man s justice been deceived by those fatal words .: 102.03
<S> oh , heavens , exclaimed valentine , who was supporting the head of morrel on her shoulder , do you not see how pale she is ?: 29.10
<S> but could i do with a million ? retorted the count .: 29.97
<S> and with whom ? with whom can it be , if not the duke of the duke of yes , monsieur , replied the citizen , giving a still fainter intonation to his voice .: 42.87
<S> oh , thanks !: 14.11
<S> bad weather ! observed one of the bearers ; not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea . why , yes , the abbe runs a chance of being wet , said the other ; and then there was a burst of brutal laughter .: 66.71
<S> from blois to paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers , but d artagnan arrived on the third day at the barriere saint denis .: 45.34
<S> edmond , amazed , wonderstruck , filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight , when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles .: 110.36
<S> at length , with a violent effort at self control : the name of that woman ? he said .: 24.83
<S> time , however , passed away ; the hours , one after another , seemed to awaken the clock as they passed , and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the prisoner .: 42.14
<S> another might threaten to seek m. franz , to provoke him , and to fight with him ; all that would be folly .: 44.95
<S> since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations , and trusting no one but himself , he had visited personally the successor of pere marteau .: 46.33
<S> speak not of it , reverend sir .: 25.33
<S> they arrived without accident at the hotel de la chevrette .: 11.57
<S> as to porthos , except his real name as was the case with those of his two comrades , his life was very easily known .: 46.74
<S> you can not for a moment imagine , d artagnan , that i would commit such an offense toward the unknown giver , interrupted d artagnan .: 34.63
<S> my family has sought consideration in this alliance with m. de villefort ; all i seek is happiness . valentine imperceptibly thanked him , while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks .: 64.80
<S> d artagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself .: 26.23
<S> at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to stop .: 33.03
<S> we will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses , said d artagnan , and share the three hundred . we will share , said porthos .: 29.56
<S> the question is this : monsieur the principal thinks that my thesis ought to be dogmatic and didactic . your thesis !: 69.90
<S> i see her now , as on her knees at my feet , with her head thrown back , she begged for life .: 37.07
<S> moreover , something had been said of a marriage with mazarin s niece .: 39.21
<S> have you neglected to obtain information on that point ?: 42.52
<S> so , then , he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were , and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity , when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window .: 60.60
<S> on ! cried d artagnan ; there ll be firing !: 31.02
<S> oho ! said he , what is this ?: 17.90
<S> monsieur d artagnan , said the commissary , addressing athos , declare all that passed yesterday between you and monsieur . but , cried bonacieux , this is not monsieur d artagnan whom you show me . what !: 28.89
<S> well , sir , said morrel , sinking into a chair , you have heard all , and i have nothing further to tell you . i see , returned the englishman , that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you , and this only increases my desire to serve you . oh , sir ! cried morrel .: 25.48
<S> it could be seen that she had wished to speak , but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companion s words .: 32.38
<S> i have a son .: 19.08
<S> come , you shall take charge of the money , i of the jewel box ; so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure , the other would still have hers left .: 57.85
<S> i beg your pardon , said aramis , noticing his awkwardness ; if i had known that i was to have the honor of your visit i should have procured the gardener s ladder ; but for me alone this is good enough . sir , said planchet when he saw d artagnan on the summit of the ladder , this way is easy for monsieur aramis and even for you ; in case of necessity i might also climb up , but my two horses can not mount the ladder . take them to yonder shed , my friend , said aramis , pointing to a low building on the plain ; there you will find hay and straw for them ; then come back here and clap your hands three times , and we will give you wine and food .: 56.35
<S> beware , my dear d artagnan !: 13.69
<S> his father was introduced to me as a marquis , so he ought to be a count ; but i do not think he has much claim to that title . why ? said the banker .: 32.98
<S> suppose we wait a while , and see what comes of it , said he , casting a bewildered look on his companion .: 45.20
<S> she was poisoned on my account . that s all you know of him ? asked mazarin .: 25.54
<S> i know that i must have been mad , senseless , to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm ; but what then !: 84.23
<S> laughingly he said to the councillor , restored to his family : do you think , father , that if now i should ask for a company the queen would give it to me ? d artagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away raoul , whom he had great difficulty in keeping shut up during the riot , and who wished positively to strike a blow for one party or the other .: 62.63
<S> instead of lights at every window , as is customary on days of ceremony , he saw only a gray mass , which was veiled also by a cloud , which at that moment obscured the moon s feeble light .: 59.55
<S> you were writing ? said monte cristo with a searching look .: 24.12
<S> the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur .: 21.84
<S> king of france , who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses ; and it was necessary , therefore , to have recourse to some profitable scheme , which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted italy .: 50.60
<S> at last d artagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in fencing .: 37.16
<S> pale , motionless , overwhelmed by this frightful revelation , dazzled by the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime , he ended by falling on his knees before her as the early christians did before those pure and holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace .: 76.76
<S> he knows that we were sent from france by monsieur mazarin ; he will consider us as brothers .: 44.99
<S> be calm for i am sure that d artagnan and porthos are at rueil , alive and well . but , resumed athos , i recur to my first proposal .: 40.23
<S> the decanter and the glass were completely empty .: 42.97
<S> his host here was a good fellow from picardy , who gave him all the information he needed .: 49.50
<S> some nabob from india , was his comment .: 155.06
<S> he was a dead man ; and on my honor , if i had discovered that it was his son , i should have regretted having killed him . ah !: 18.28
<S> what is the matter , then , with this dear child ?: 12.51
<S> those gilded cashbooks , drawers locked like gates of fortresses , heaps of bank bills , come from i know not where , and the quantities of letters from england , holland , spain , india , china , and peru , have generally a strange influence on a father s mind , and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents .: 74.99
<S> in france chapter lxi .: 44.01
<S> you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world , and be deemed unlikely and unnatural .: 113.90
<S> on the evening of the ball teresa was attired in her best , her most brilliant ornaments in her hair , and gayest glass beads , she was in the costume of the women of frascati .: 48.96
<S> he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackney coach , then the coachman s voice , and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows .: 39.74
<S> the count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there ; but they had all been pensioned , or had passed on to some other employment .: 72.39
<S> this commissary was a man of very repulsive mien , with a pointed nose , with yellow and salient cheek bones , with eyes small but keen and penetrating , and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the fox .: 66.41
<S> overhead i could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller , who , after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night , threw himself on his bed , and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight .: 61.91
<S> already dante s had visited this maritime bourse two or three times , and seeing all these hardy free traders , who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent , he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds .: 138.79
<S> coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st. magloire , for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there ; but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos .: 77.69
<S> all the same , i should like to do him that service what do you say to it ? i will tell the coadjutor , said bazin .: 32.12
<S> monsieur porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you , saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you left . good , said aramis , taking a purse which bazin presented to him .: 40.93
<S> he is , i think , the son of general d e pinay ? he is . the same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815 ? by the bonapartists . yes .: 44.19
<S> at the third he fell again .: 21.65
<S> what is he contriving ? asked aramis .: 11.50
<S> d artagnan believed him to be dead , or at least insensible , and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order ; but the moment he extended his hand to search for it , the wounded man , who had not dropped his sword , plunged the point into d artagnan s breast , crying , one for you ! and one for me the best for last ! cried d artagnan , furious , nailing him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body .: 36.88
<S> this child has caused me to recover what i had lost .: 36.08
<S> i hope so , was the reply .: 19.26
<S> dante s was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh .: 48.48
<S> one may see that you love your family , madame coquenard , said the procurator , with a smile that was almost tragic .: 27.91
<S> was it from london you brought that beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger ?: 78.60
<S> it depends on the distance he may be from the city , whether he gives eight hours , twelve hours , or a day wherein to pay their ransom ; and when that time has elapsed he allows another hour s grace .: 75.78
<S> fernand s fortune was already waxing great , and she developed with his growing fortune .: 107.60
<S> it glistened with such extraordinary joy , so rich and full of thought , that the physician was struck .: 65.89
<S> yes , and now i shall be more calm . you know i am waiting , said monte cristo , smiling .: 14.99
<S> he then left for madrid , and was no more heard of .: 60.08
<S> why , she inquired in a hoarse voice , did you invite him to sleep here tonight ? why ? said caderousse with a shudder ; why , that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire . ah , responded the woman , with an expression impossible to describe ; i thought it was for something else . woman , woman why do you have such ideas ? cried caderousse ; or , if you have them , why don t you keep them to yourself ? well , said la carconte , after a moment s pause , you are not a man . what do you mean ? added caderousse .: 26.59
<S> will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the count s room , and in ten minutes all will be settled . mazarin started .: 18.85
<S> the drum immediately beat , and the little troop advanced at charging pace .: 62.14
<S> it is a beautiful house , or at all events may be made so . there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title , your excellency , for the tapestried hangings are very old . let them all be taken away and changed , then , with the exception of the sleeping chamber which is hung with red damask ; you will leave that exactly as it is . bertuccio bowed .: 53.07
<S> but , hark , hark !: 54.87
<S> he was armed at all points .: 38.64
<S> oh , my king ! and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people . just so madame , replied chatillon , in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation .: 59.59
<S> is she going to fall in love with me , by chance , this fair inconstant ; and will she be disposed to give me myself another sapphire like that which she gave me for de wardes ? d artagnan rapidly drew his seat nearer to milady s .: 67.67
<S> will that satisfy you ? must this last formality take place in your presence , sir ? inquired a turnkey .: 52.07
<S> listen , then . ah , murmured caderousse , what a strange priest you are ; you drive the dying to despair , instead of consoling them . listen , continued the abbe .: 39.22
<S> i called the valet , i stopped the postilion , i spoke to m. de saint me ran , i applied my smelling salts ; but all was over , and i arrived at aix by the side of a corpse . villefort stood with his mouth half open , quite stupefied .: 46.25
<S> from this moment i declare the vendetta against you , so protect yourself as well as you can , for the next time we meet your last hour has come . and before he had recovered from his surprise , i opened the door and left the room . well , well , said monte cristo , such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things , m. bertuccio , and to a king s attorney at that !: 36.23
<S> as yet he could form no definite plan ; all must depend on circumstances .: 126.60
<S> go on , while i endeavor to recall circumstances . and now i am convinced , said d artagnan , that this abduction of the queen s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking , and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris . the gascon is full of ideas , said porthos , with admiration .: 30.90
<S> why , it is as good as a century !: 19.61
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> and you say , sir , he interposed , that the two dungeons were separated by a distance of fifty feet ; but it appears that this edmond dante s this dangerous man s name was edmond dante s .: 25.96
<S> at this cry all the crowd re entered the apartment , and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult .: 49.86
<S> from this moment i become your friend , and since you are engaged in my affairs i ought to occupy myself in yours . madame , replied athos , i have only to ask your majesty s prayers . and i , said aramis , i am alone in the world and have only your majesty to serve . the queen held out her hand , which they kissed , and she said in a low tone to de winter : if you need money , my lord , separate the jewels i have given you ; detach the diamonds and sell them to some jew .: 33.55
<S> eh !: 18.68
<S> i demand the suppression of the thesis . since then , continued aramis , i have lived very agreeably .: 62.69
<S> in the name of heaven , madame , said villefort , where is the doctor ?: 10.14
<S> one word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to d artagnan s deliberations ; this was the name of madame de longueville .: 43.22
<S> and i , too , said d artagnan .: 5.57
<S> but you don t know us ; when we can t have one thing we invent another . and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody ? only to our host .: 83.08
<S> ah , it is you , my lord ! said he .: 7.07
<S> will we not pay for our liberty with a single promise of silence ?: 65.30
<S> from time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd ; projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard , the echo of which , though they were probably fired in the air , made all hearts vibrate .: 80.23
<S> go , my son go , my dear ge rard , and by your obedience to my paternal orders , or , if you prefer it , friendly counsels , we will keep you in your place .: 42.09
<S> but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased , athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles .: 52.59
<S> meanwhile , madame , if you really suffer , said felton , a physician shall be sent for ; and if you deceive us well , it will be the worse for you .: 35.85
<S> it was three o clock when he threw himself on the bed .: 10.19
<S> i understand , bertuccio has been sent by my protector . the keeper spoke for a moment with an official , then opened the iron gates and conducted andrea to a room on the first floor .: 49.63
<S> you are about to become captain at nineteen an elevated post ; you are about to marry a pretty girl , who loves you ; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone . you are right ; you know men better than i do , and what you say may possibly be the case , i confess ; but if such persons are among my acquaintances i prefer not to know it , because then i should be forced to hate them . you are wrong ; you should always strive to see clearly around you .: 52.90
<S> i took then , in conformity with the orders of the authorities , who sent me a reinforcement of six men , such measures as i thought necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coiners . again ! said d artagnan , whose ears chafed terribly under the repetition of this word coiners .: 59.42
<S> for the rest , in the memoirs of this period , which has left so many memoirs , one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies ; and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword .: 47.78
<S> i am fond of these jars , upon which , perhaps , misshapen , frightful monsters have fixed their cold , dull eyes , and in which myriads of small fish have slept , seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies . meanwhile , danglars , who had cared little for curiosities , was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange tree , one after another .: 76.15
<S> the cardinal made an approving gesture , and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming .: 41.04
<S> one day when they were talking over their plans for the future , they heard two or three reports of firearms , and then suddenly a man came out of the wood , near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks , and hurried towards them .: 34.56
<S> four years ago , penelon was at trieste penelon , count , is the old sailor you saw in the garden , and who , from quartermaster , has become gardener penelon , when he was at trieste , saw on the quay an englishman , who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht , and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of june , 1829 , and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of september .: 49.64
<S> she , with a still smiling countenance , took his arm , and passed with him under a low arched door , which by a vaulted passage , lighted only at the farther end , led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone .: 58.28
<S> that which i have to say is too long , and above all , too secret . well , what is to be done ? if monsieur chevalier would follow me ? said kitty , timidly .: 33.18
<S> well , i will live , if you promise me still to hope ; and if you grant me the care of your future prospects , you will redouble my strength .: 28.71
<S> there , said he , there is the work complete .: 19.70
<S> i made inquiries , and found that the house in the champs e lyse es is his own property , and certainly it was very decently kept up .: 39.61
<S> certainly , after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by m. de villefort towards his own relations , i ought to have denounced him to the authorities ; then i should not have been an accomplice to thy death , as i now am , sweet , beloved valentine ; but the accomplice shall become the avenger .: 46.96
<S> confound it !: 62.52
<S> limited warranty , disclaimer of damages except for the right of replacement or refund described in paragraph 1.f.3 , the project gutenberg literary archive foundation , the owner of the project gutenberg trademark , and any other party distributing a project gutenberg electronic work under this agreement , disclaim all liability to you for damages , costs and expenses , including legal fees .: 15.45
<S> he even went so far as to show us the way out ; he led us to the park wall , which we climbed over without accident , and then we fell in with grimaud . well ! exclaimed aramis , this will reconcile me to him ; but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act . my lord , said d artagnan , no longer able to contain himself , allow me to introduce to you the chevalier d herblay , who wishes as you may have heard to offer his congratulations to your eminence . and he retired , discovering mazarin , who was in great confusion , to the astonished gaze of aramis .: 39.95
<S> ha ! cried porthos , who was not completely taken in by d artagnan s gasconades .: 25.83
<S> the shade of cardinal richelieu .: 57.69
<S> he turned back , a door partly open enabled him to see his road , and to hear the voice of one in sorrow .: 44.31
<S> felton was indeed behind the door , and had not lost one word of this scene .: 23.99
<S> but sit down , said monte cristo ; really i do not know what i have been thinking of i have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour . don t mention it . the major drew an armchair towards him , and proceeded to seat himself .: 29.12
<S> milady was all attention .: 52.07
<S> i will take him for judge in his own cause , monsieur , and will believe what he will say . m. de la tre mouille reflected for an instant ; then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal , he agreed to it .: 40.71
<S> he shut the bedroom door after him , without adding another word , and returned to his apartments ; and when madame danglars recovered from her half fainting condition , she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream .: 41.74
<S> i have just killed an old friend . indeed ! replied porthos , who ? that poor count de rochefort . well !: 29.13
<S> it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise ; men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire . oh , that goes for nothing , said gaetano .: 71.66
<S> i have formed an acquaintance , thanks to my good fortune , with many noted persons , and have , at least for the moment , a crowd of friends .: 47.31
<S> they were said , however , to be of good extraction .: 37.97
<S> athos , foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount , had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings .: 71.63
<S> the count was no longer young .: 20.00
<S> no , the sacrifice , returned cha teau renaud ; ask debray if he would sacrifice his english steed for a stranger ? not for a stranger , said debray , but for a friend i might , perhaps . i divined that you would become mine , count , replied morrel ; besides , as i had the honor to tell you , heroism or not , sacrifice or not , that day i owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us . the history to which m. morrel alludes , continued cha teau renaud , is an admirable one , which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him ; today let us fill our stomachs , and not our memories .: 65.50
<S> well ? asked athos , when he had closed the letter .: 16.93
<S> ah , the young rascal stealing in a garden he does not know where that may lead him to . certainly , it is wrong , said monte cristo , but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent . of course , said the gardener , but that does not make it the less unpleasant .: 44.96
<S> hola , bazin , come here this minute . bazin appeared on the threshold , dull and spiritless .: 67.25
<S> d artagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus , and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines ; but at this moment two shots were fired .: 28.96
<S> a silence of death reigned in the cabin as in the pavilion ; but as the cabin was his last resource , he knocked again .: 60.86
<S> i ask for it ; without it i should be tried in a court of justice because i did not raise the alarm .: 47.44
<S> as soon as you see him get up , stretch out your arm and seize him by the neck .: 35.51
<S> as he was in the deepest of his strategic meditations , the door opened , and rochefort returned .: 25.28
<S> my trial was to come on at the approaching assizes ; when , on the 8th of september that is to say , precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my life the abbe busoni , whom i never ventured to believe i should see , presented himself at the prison doors , saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him ; he added , that having learned at marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment , he hastened to comply with my desire .: 45.72
<S> he fixed his eyes upon d artagnan even more earnestly than before .: 22.53
<S> you furnished a principal of 100,000 francs .: 44.41
<S> as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you , i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services . the two young men bowed .: 29.70
<S> he is quite a child ! and tis a child he loves . athos became thoughtful .: 44.42
<S> well ? to morrow i am on guard . in stuart s room ? yes ; come and pass the night with me . impossible ! impossible !: 47.35
<S> donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations .: 65.39
<S> where ? stammered morcerf .: 59.46
<S> i also i love you .: 29.58
<S> the door immediately closed , and d artagnan found himself again in complete obscurity .: 23.38
<S> you , a frondeur ! on my word of honor , said athos , one must be either a mazarinist or a frondeur .: 37.48
<S> availing himself of a handle that projected from a half fallen door , he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief , from his pocket , wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow , then , advancing to the door , struck thrice with the end of his iron shod stick .: 73.12
<S> except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.f.3 , this work is provided to you as is , with no other warranties of any kind , express or implied , including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose .: 36.67
<S> bernouin , seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight , had made an examination of the orangery .: 61.39
<S> he had a great desire to go to the window , but he dared not .: 15.39
<S> well , said he , let us see , gentlemen , what are his eminence s commands , and d artagnan unsealed the letter and read , m .: 17.55
<S> it is quite wonderful , said albert .: 12.02
<S> pardon me , d artagnan , he said .: 8.91
<S> saint denis .: 67.77
<S> that nobleman was you ; it was his father ! hush !: 55.80
<S> de morcerf , continued beauchamp , looked at this woman with surprise and terror .: 22.72
<S> the jailer went away shaking his head .: 23.85
<S> if a second traveller had passed , he would have seen a strange thing , a shepherdess watching her flock , clad in a cashmere grown , with ear rings and necklace of pearls , diamond pins , and buttons of sapphires , emeralds , and rubies .: 52.23
<S> but all this will come to an end , tre ville , will come to an end .: 30.30
<S> yes ; i am a man of honor , said d artagnan , determined to come to an end , and since your love is mine , and i am satisfied i possess it for i do possess it , do i not ? entirely ; go on . well , i feel as if transformed a confession weighs on my mind . a confession ! if i had the least doubt of your love i would not make it , but you love me , my beautiful mistress , do you not ? without doubt . then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you , you will pardon me ? perhaps . d artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to milady s , but she evaded him .: 39.22
<S> in brief , i regained your harness and then mine .: 67.84
<S> there is no doubt of that .: 11.31
<S> milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel , in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity .: 64.81
<S> i rose , and again began digging and enlarging the hole ; still i found nothing , nothing the chest was no longer there ! 30269m the chest no longer there ? murmured madame danglars , choking with fear .: 100.27
<S> yes , let us go to the library , please . the marquis took his arm , and they left the salon .: 21.14
<S> a telegraphic signal , improperly interpreted , owing to the fog , was the cause of this error . the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen .: 72.58
<S> what ? said mousqueton .: 14.84
<S> believe me , the eye of the eagle is closed forever .: 26.64
<S> no matter , observed caderousse , replacing the box in his pocket , someone else will purchase it . yes , continued the jeweller ; but someone else will not be so easy as i am , or content himself with the same story .: 38.08
<S> the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy ; a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness .: 20.63
<S> dante s had tasted nothing , but he thought not of hunger at such a moment ; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum , and again entered the cavern .: 34.50
<S> as regarded her attainments , the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty , that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person .: 91.16
<S> this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted .: 18.95
<S> but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand .: 21.13
<S> at sight of the officer broussel was somewhat moved , but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also .: 79.83
<S> he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen , and which was surrounded with divans .: 29.57
<S> if mousqueton were with us , observed athos , on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers , how he would tremble at passing this !: 63.47
<S> then , as she had done the evening before , she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud .: 19.30
<S> this night i am determined to be free . and if i defend myself , or call , or cry out ? i will kill thee , on the honor of a gentleman . at this moment the clock struck .: 31.60
<S> i will leave the paternal home , i will give up all .: 30.20
<S> golden dreams ! cried aramis .: 61.02
<S> the noise became louder ; the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant .: 24.84
<S> it was this fear that restrained him , so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds it .: 84.20
<S> you may join me at the ho tel des gardes .: 11.15
<S> well , said beauchamp , we shall see our friend ! yes , indeed ! replied debray .: 16.89
<S> comte de la fere , you wish to perish by his hands !: 24.54
<S> i see !: 33.94
<S> what encouraged me not to become your surety , but to patronize you ? your father s name , so well known in italy and so highly honored .: 62.83
<S> what think you of it ? inquired athos .: 13.79
<S> may you not have been philandering a little also , monsieur bonacieux ?: 66.35
<S> nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states .: 25.45
<S> well , said the baroness , do you leave m. cavalcanti with your daughter ? and mademoiselle d armilly , said the banker ; do you consider her no one ? then , turning to monte cristo , he said , prince cavalcanti is a charming young man , is he not ?: 19.05
<S> no , i spoke of the duchess de chevreuse ; did you see her after her return from brussels , after the king s death ? yes , she is still beautiful . yes , said aramis , i saw her also at that time .: 26.25
<S> d artagnan , however , gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take , and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey .: 38.18
<S> this time a small troop advanced , consisting of from twenty to twenty five men ; but they were not pioneers , they were soldiers of the garrison .: 51.78
<S> permesso ? inquired he .: 56.42
<S> athos had even gone so far as to question m. de tre ville a thing which , considering the habitual reticence of the worthy musketeer , had very much astonished his captain .: 58.44
<S> the gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers , whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence .: 150.33
<S> bonacieux , yes , there are traitors here ; but by the holy name of the virgin , i swear that no one is more devoted to your majesty than i am .: 36.97
<S> along the isle of dogs . and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another .: 97.69
<S> porthos went before her , and instead of a finger , dipped his whole hand in .: 55.13
<S> d artagnan , going to a distance to discover aramis .: 17.54
<S> it is you who surrendered the castle of yanina !: 19.79
<S> raised to the height of twenty feet , so as to be on a level with the window , it had two lower stories .: 60.80
<S> d artagnan took leave of milady , and left the saloon the happiest of men .: 26.53
<S> now remember that you are a general and do not go and drink . for twenty years i have tasted nothing but water . the man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor , who heard the sound of his fingers counting and handling the gold pieces .: 40.16
<S> sire , murmured lord leven , crushed by shame , sire , we are ready to give you every proof of our fidelity . i ask but one , said the king ; put the army in battle array and face the enemy . that can not be , sire , said the earl .: 44.21
<S> take a last farewell , sir , of her sad remains ; take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own , and then separate yourself from her forever .: 119.54
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> speak , sir !: 16.91
<S> every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs .: 37.52
<S> her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea ; but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly : edmond , edmond , edmond ! chapter 113 .: 88.52
<S> louis xiii .: 12.19
<S> well , i will teach you how to behave yourself . and i will send you back to your mass book , master abbe .: 35.96
<S> you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth ! said athos .: 55.75
<S> and then , shut out from friendship , having but one affection , which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits , she thought of herself of no one but herself .: 72.05
<S> i tendered my resignation , for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle field , you do not know how to man uvre on the slippery grounds of the salons .: 53.25
<S> halloo , major !: 57.56
<S> if m. danglars will not fight with me , i will kill his son in law ; cavalcanti will certainly fight . the servant announced the young man ; but the banker , recollecting what had transpired the day before , did not wish him admitted .: 47.57
<S> it had not been used .: 22.91
<S> then that is agreed , said the king , and that is all i had to say to you . but on what day will this ball take place ? asked anne of austria .: 18.22
<S> why , you strike like a blind or a deaf man . it was necessary ; my man was going to fire a pistol at me ; but you how did you get rid of yours ? oh , mine , replied d artagnan , was not a man . what was it then ? it was an apparition . and i charmed it away . without further explanation d artagnan took the pistols which were upon the front seat , placed them in his belt , wrapped himself in his cloak , and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left , he took his way toward the richelieu gate .: 45.29
<S> the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments .: 39.02
<S> well , it is impossible but that master aramis , that keen scented bloodhound , and athos , that wise and prudent nobleman , will discover our retreat .: 97.03
<S> a duel was the pretext for my wound .: 55.29
<S> for my own part , i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes . so saying , the countess quitted franz , leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense , or whether her fears and agitations were genuine .: 47.07
<S> if i were not in such haste , and if i were not running after someone , said d artagnan .: 19.61
<S> how will you have them protect you ?: 35.81
<S> they were about to proceed to the reading of the contract , which half paris assembled was to sign .: 44.00
<S> at length , through the window of a little hut , they showed me a woman sitting , leaning on a table , and said , there is the person to be executed . horrible ! said the monk .: 28.07
<S> the sight of this , instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon , filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment , and tears fell from his eyes .: 37.35
<S> you are laughing at me . i understand .: 33.48
<S> in the first place , light me a torch . ah , yes , i understand , replied the patron , to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment .: 28.62
<S> when once i know the hour , i will hasten to this spot , you can easily get over this fence with my assistance , a carriage will await us at the gate , in which you will accompany me to my sister s ; there living , retired or mingling in society , as you wish , we shall be enabled to use our power to resist oppression , and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep , which only defend themselves by sighs . yes , said valentine , i will now acknowledge you are right , maximilian ; and now are you satisfied with your betrothal ? said the young girl sorrowfully .: 48.79
<S> they broke open the doors and searched the dwelling , but in vain .: 50.53
<S> it is you , tre ville .: 17.53
<S> i tell you i am madame bonacieux ; i tell you i belong to the queen ! cried the unfortunate woman .: 21.39
<S> merce de s might have been a queen , sir , if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent .: 28.56
<S> this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentine s absence had done .: 156.18
<S> i never had a vocation for the bands ; my cassock is fastened by one button only , and i am always ready to become a musketeer once more .: 68.61
<S> this force was therefore wholly insufficient , and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty .: 53.27
<S> he was a most lovely child , with large blue eyes , of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion ; only his hair , which was too light , gave his face a most singular expression , and added to the vivacity of his look , and the malice of his smile .: 40.47
<S> without that precaution valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured .: 152.30
<S> and even if she were to be seriously offended , i could well understand it ; your majesty has treated her with a severity it is thus i will always treat my enemies and yours , duke , however high they may be placed , and whatever peril i may incur in acting severely toward them . the queen is my enemy , but is not yours , sire ; on the contrary , she is a devoted , submissive , and irreproachable wife .: 77.88
<S> eh ! said he , which meant , do you see him ? parbleu ! i answered , and we perfectly understood one another .: 46.53
<S> bonacieux whom the boatman had noticed .: 130.06
<S> there they are ! the coachman turning around , gave friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with pain .: 103.85
<S> it was simply yet richly furnished .: 89.16
<S> yet these two noble and intelligent creatures , united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love , had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another , and economizing their stores , and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance : mother , we have no more money . 50141m merce de s had never known misery ; she had often , in her youth , spoken of poverty , but between want and necessity , those synonymous words , there is a wide difference .: 93.89
<S> notwithstanding that assurance , morrel still hesitated .: 124.48
<S> it appeared likewise that mme .: 28.63
<S> he sent us home in his own carriage .: 38.04
<S> he rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window ; he saw glittering below him the muskets of the guards .: 38.41
<S> my friends , retire . they all bowed , and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered .: 65.40
<S> what are you doing ? asked he .: 5.04
<S> i think these fellows will never come . if you are in haste , monsieur , said d artagnan , with the same simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off the duel for three days , and if it be your will to dispatch me at once , do not inconvenience yourself , i pray you . there is another word which pleases me , cried athos , with a gracious nod to d artagnan .: 26.78
<S> now , said aramis , you will please to understand , gentlemen , that bazin alone can carry this letter to tours .: 29.70
<S> meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which d artagnan , in raising the shutters , had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window .: 38.69
<S> do not cast yourself against such a rock ; he would break you like glass . that will not prevent me , replied d artagnan , if ever i find him . in the meantime , said tre ville , seek him not if i have a right to advise you . all at once the captain stopped , as if struck by a sudden suspicion .: 35.26
<S> do they know him ? asked cha teau renaud .: 9.41
<S> this was all that m. de tre ville wanted .: 18.89
<S> and yet that villain , benedetto , will escape ! no one , i tell you , will escape ; benedetto will be punished . then , you , too , will be punished , for you did not do your duty as a priest you should have prevented benedetto from killing me . i ? said the count , with a smile which petrified the dying man , when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast !: 52.38
<S> but she had her son .: 31.71
<S> the cannonade of the isle of re presaged to him the dragonnades of the ce vennes ; the taking of la rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the edict of nantes .: 43.49
<S> he aspires to the hand of the proud euge nie . what does that signify , so long as they favor your suit ? but it is not the case , my dear count : on the contrary .: 41.28
<S> the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses .: 85.50
<S> this son is named andrea cavalcanti .: 44.00
<S> i know not ; i merely suppose so , as i might suppose anything else , replied villefort with a look so fixed , it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness .: 47.14
<S> an envoy of the duke of buckingham , named montague , was taken , and proof was obtained of a league between the german empire , spain , england , and lorraine .: 55.89

<S> gentlemen , he said , when he was in his room , you do not expect , i presume , to keep me here a long time incognito ? no , my lord , replied the gascon ; on the contrary , we think of announcing very soon that we have you here . then you will be besieged . we expect it . and what shall you do ? defend ourselves .: 26.83
<S> in the course of his morning s walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass , a discovery that quite delighted him .: 63.08
<S> i perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion , he muttered .: 56.07
<S> this time i , too , saw them , said porthos .: 24.66
<S> where is her stepmother ?: 29.88

<S> andrea assumed his gayest manner .: 46.24
<S> have we ceased to be men ? no , said aramis , but that fellow is a fiend ; and ask the uncle whether i was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew . de winter only replied by a groan .: 64.50
<S> no , mother , capital 3,000 francs .: 35.50
<S> we are going to rejoin that good fellow , porthos .: 27.98
<S> my dear count , said albert , advancing to meet him , permit me to repeat the poor thanks i offered last night , and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you will never be effaced from my memory ; believe me , as long as i live , i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me ; and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my life . my very good friend and excellent neighbor , replied the count , with a smile , you really exaggerate my trifling exertions .: 46.95
<S> if he comes ? shall we not know it ? how ? nothing easier .: 42.29
<S> benedetto never again appeared at rogliano , neither have i since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him .: 177.97
<S> the discourse is over ; farewell , gentlemen , said the count , unceremoniously .: 27.30
<S> they sent him a magnificent supper , and took his million .: 44.93
<S> tell them she was my beloved , my noble girl , my only blessing in the world .: 54.79
<S> one evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at leghorn , wrapped himself in his coat and lay down , and said to the crew , to the island of elba ! the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning franz disembarked at porto ferrajo .: 58.10
<S> all without had heard , as we have said , athos , porthos , and aramis called , and had guessed , from m. de tre ville s tone of voice , that he was very angry about something .: 32.02
<S> i can tell you but one thing , sir , for the secret you wish to know is not my own .: 21.20
<S> i acted well as a man , but you have acted better than man .: 45.51

<S> many women held their infants on their shoulders , and thus the children had the best view .: 47.04
<S> see ! answered the voice .: 22.04
<S> the communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you , and which does you honor .: 60.97
<S> he had not so noble an air as athos , and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman , whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress .: 70.95
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> raoul , delighted at the count s companionship , perceived , or affected to perceive nothing of this byplay .: 68.07
<S> from pure zeal ? resumed mazarin , with his artful smile ; from pure zeal and devotion then ? my lord has , perhaps , no faith in those words ? said d artagnan .: 81.03
<S> there had been no stipulation in her favor .: 19.70
<S> duc d harcourt , fontrailles , and the others escaped ; de rieux was inclined to do likewise , but i told him they wouldn t look for us where we were .: 69.67

<S> this knife is the knife with which felton stabbed him .: 65.88

<S> to undermine the ground for fifty feet to devote three years to a labor which , if successful , would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty , sixty , perhaps a hundred feet , at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks , should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels ; and even , supposing all these perils past , then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore were difficulties so startling and formidable that dante s had never even dreamed of such a scheme , resigning himself rather to death .: 105.35
<S> it does not appear to be very clean in the crossroads . d artagnan glanced down at his boots , all covered with mud ; but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer , and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap .: 56.68
<S> the order of imprisonment came from high authority , and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source ; and , as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight , the letters have not yet been forwarded . but , said morrel , is there no way of expediting all these formalities of releasing him from arrest ? there has been no arrest . how ? it is sometimes essential to government to cause a man s disappearance without leaving any traces , so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes . it might be so under the bourbons , but at present it has always been so , my dear morrel , since the reign of louis xiv .: 77.52
<S> avast , there , all hands !: 173.07
<S> nearly ten minutes passed ; i heard no other noise but the beating of my own heart .: 41.52

<S> thanks , m. bertuccio , said the count , springing lightly up the three steps of the portico ; and the notary ? he is in the small salon , excellency , returned bertuccio .: 24.18
<S> the child was born , was given to me motionless , breathless , voiceless ; we thought it dead . madame danglars moved rapidly , as though she would spring from her chair , but villefort stopped , and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention .: 51.05

<S> the carriage stopped , the footman sprang off the box and opened the door .: 18.14
<S> that s all right , my dear aramis , take care of yourself , said he ; i will go alone in search of athos . you are a man of brass , replied aramis .: 14.80
<S> the last attack i had , said he , lasted but half an hour , and after it i was hungry , and got up without help ; now i can move neither my right arm nor leg , and my head seems uncomfortable , which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain .: 72.66
<S> compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements .: 40.51
<S> when he was only eleven , he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty , the worst characters in bastia , or , indeed , in corsica , and they had already , for some mischievous pranks , been several times threatened with a prosecution .: 97.97
<S> all that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and disdainful words , i poured out upon this man .: 84.05
<S> perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary . it is probable , stammered out villefort , trying to smile ; but i can assure you that i had nothing to do with any such proceeding .: 39.24
<S> as i was saying last night , they intend me to be ransomed .: 67.50

<S> at last a nightingale , lost in a thicket of shrubs , in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep .: 73.98
<S> why , you see , he did not expect to see dante s return so suddenly he thought he was dead , perhaps ; or perchance faithless !: 54.32
<S> no sir . i ask , as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church . he is the curate of bethune , sir , and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church , and the treasure of the chapter , to a safe place , the prince having abandoned our town yesterday ; and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country , no one dared to accompany the good man , so i offered to do so .: 59.50
<S> but let us return to yourself .: 16.40
<S> because , monsieur , replied kitty , my mistress loves you not at all . hein ! said d artagnan , can she have charged you to tell me so ? oh , no , monsieur ; but out of the regard i have for you , i have taken the resolution to tell you so . much obliged , my dear kitty ; but for the intention only for the information , you must agree , is not likely to be at all agreeable . that is to say , you don t believe what i have told you ; is it not so ? we have always some difficulty in believing such things , my pretty dear , were it only from self love . then you don t believe me ? i confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you advance what do you think of this ? kitty drew a little note from her bosom .: 40.06
<S> they killed a dozen pheasants in the park , as many trout in the stream , dined in a summer house overlooking the ocean , and took tea in the library .: 50.02
<S> i am afraid for the king s safety ; place yourself close to the coach door on the right . reassure yourself , madame , i will answer for the king s safety . as he left the queen s presence bernouin summoned him to the cardinal .: 28.16
<S> we have said that teresa was handsome , but this is not all ; teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies .: 69.46

<S> they say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones , said another , lifting the feet .: 89.77

<S> nothing but intrigues !: 95.83
<S> you will excuse me , will you not ?: 9.71
<S> yes , he answered , if a fortune brings consolation , i ought to be consoled ; i am rich . so rich , dear sir , that your fortune resembles the pyramids ; if you wished to demolish them you could not , and if it were possible , you would not dare ! danglars smiled at the good natured pleasantry of the count .: 48.28
<S> albert recognized the bearer .: 47.32
<S> the favorite , the confidant , the first man , in short , at the court , he had been obliged to yield his place to mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor ; and eventually , as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position , the queen had had him arrested and sent to vincennes in charge of guitant , who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again .: 56.24
<S> la ramee adored his wife and children , whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall , when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat .: 39.02

<S> an instant after , bazin made his appearance at the door .: 18.02

<S> buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance .: 153.98
<S> no it was somewhere away from here it was i do not know but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious fe te ; mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand , the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden , and you , madame , were under the trellis of some arbor .: 85.70
<S> but it was not upon corsica , the very houses of which he could distinguish ; or on sardinia ; or on the island of elba , with its historical associations ; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud , and leghorn the commercial , that he gazed .: 92.31
<S> noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child , but wished her good night , for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill .: 76.76
<S> i still assist at executions , but no longer strike the blow myself no , indeed . you have , then , a repugnance to your profession ? so long as i struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession allowed me to sleep quietly , sheltered as i was by justice and law ; but since that terrible night when i became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred i raised the sword over one of god s creatures since that day the executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair .: 88.70
<S> as to d artagnan , scarcely , on his side , was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter , which he read over again : return immediately to paris . j .: 32.73
<S> d artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy .: 51.28
<S> take these , said beauchamp , presenting the papers to albert .: 42.01
<S> if the cardinal does not hold you in high admiration for the affair of london , he entertains a great hatred for you ; but as , considering everything , he can not accuse you openly , and as hatred must be satisfied , particularly when it s a cardinal s hatred , take care of yourself .: 65.71
<S> no count of monte cristo added debray .: 34.57
<S> you are still yourself as now , and yet you are yourself no longer ; you who , like ariel , verge on the angelic , are but an inert mass , which , like caliban , verges on the brutal ; and this is called in human tongues , as i tell you , neither more nor less than apoplexy .: 68.88
<S> the road was long , but the horses upon which d artagnan and planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the lord of bracieux ; the master and servant rode side by side , conversing as they went , for d artagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant .: 92.68
<S> i have since learned that he was confined in the cha teau d if , and i should like to learn some particulars of his death . what was his name ? the abbe faria . oh , i recollect him perfectly , cried m. de boville ; he was crazy . so they said . oh , he was , decidedly . very possibly ; but what sort of madness was it ? he pretended to know of an immense treasure , and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate him . poor devil ! and he is dead ? yes , sir , five or six months ago , last february . you have a good memory , sir , to recollect dates so well . i recollect this , because the poor devil s death was accompanied by a singular incident . may i ask what that was ? said the englishman with an expression of curiosity , which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance .: 43.98
<S> well , well , said the jeweller , you seem , my good friends , to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money , by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone . oh , no , answered caderousse , that was not my reason , i can assure you ; but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected , as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune , and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream . the jeweller smiled .: 49.08
<S> oh , sir ! cried olivain , the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat is drifting .: 46.89
<S> mordioux ! answered d artagnan , i believe we must .: 32.97
<S> he went straight to the queen , and in an altered voice said , why , madame , have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs , when you know it would give me so much gratification ? the queen cast a glance around her , and saw the cardinal behind , with a diabolical smile on his countenance .: 30.46
<S> god , who might have directed the assassin s dagger so as to end your career in a moment , has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance .: 60.84
<S> villainous host ! cried he , he has given us anjou wine instead of champagne , and fancies we know no better !: 76.71
<S> what is that noise ? demanded milady .: 18.90
<S> we look hideous , said athos .: 33.94
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> gentlemen , said the man , who was young and pale , bowing with ease and courtesy , pardon my curiosity , but i see you come from paris , or at least that you are strangers at boulogne . we come from paris , yes , replied athos , with the same courtesy ; what is there we can do for you ? sir , said the young man , will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that cardinal mazarin is no longer minister ? that is a strange question , said aramis .: 29.22
<S> it appears to me that we have an account to settle with him , and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts , of this kind , at least . ah !: 25.13
<S> my name is mordaunt , replied the young man , bowing .: 13.42
<S> shall i tell you what you ought to do , morcerf ? command me , madame . well , then , you should go and bring your count of monte cristo to us . what for ? asked euge nie .: 22.18
<S> he was struck by a sudden idea .: 21.31
<S> and you , baron , pursued the count , addressing franz , do you also depart tomorrow ? yes . for france ? no , for venice ; i shall remain in italy for another year or two . then we shall not meet in paris ? i fear i shall not have that honor . well , since we must part , said the count , holding out a hand to each of the young men , allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey . it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him , and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch , for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse .: 36.44
<S> whatever happens , let us not leave england before the crisis .: 78.17
<S> i ? said the novice .: 18.86
<S> i take them , then , said the lieutenant .: 12.16
<S> these are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber , said monte cristo .: 50.64
<S> sdeath ! cried he to the coachman .: 18.26
<S> i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe , but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say . because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors .: 58.20
<S> he paused , exchanged two words with the sentinel ; then the door opened , and he appeared .: 19.99
<S> no doubt you come to join the princes ! as thou seest , planchet , said aramis , whilst athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of mousqueton , bazin and grimaud .: 72.94
<S> the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that cha teau renaud did not seek to dissuade him , and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion .: 52.01

<S> morrel is in his room , is he not , mademoiselle julie ? said the cashier .: 30.37
<S> he was well known at the ho tel of the musketeers , where everyone considered him a good comrade .: 29.74
<S> and yet , notwithstanding these precautions , i remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind .: 33.44

<S> come , come , dearest valentine , confess that what i say is true , lest i be tempted to call you unjust . 30055m it is true , said valentine , as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks , and permitted maximilian to press his lips to them , and you are a true and faithful friend ; but still you acted from motives of self interest , my dear maximilian , for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us .: 60.97
<S> these four frenchmen have escaped from newcastle , and no doubt want to carry off the king .: 46.69
<S> by the bye , he said , i think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus , without leaving a line for porthos and d artagnan . the thing is done , dear friend , said athos ; i foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself . you are a wonderful man , my dear count , said aramis ; you think of everything . well , have you made up your mind to this journey ? quite ; and now that i reflect about it , i am glad to leave paris at this moment . and so am i , replied athos ; my only regret is not having seen d artagnan ; but the rascal is so cunning , he might have guessed our project . when supper was over blaisois entered .: 37.38
<S> and the cry issued from his pores , if we may thus speak a cry frightful in its silence .: 127.60
<S> you are a generous man , albert , but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment ; if you refuse me , if you ask another for what i have a right to offer you , i will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair . albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter .: 41.55
<S> in the first one handy , provided it is safe , said the commissary , with an indifference which penetrated poor bonacieux with horror .: 55.60
<S> let us , then , support monarchy , in order to support ourselves .: 36.39

<S> it seemed to him that the island trembled to its base , and that it would , like a vessel at anchor , break moorings , and bear him off into the centre of the storm .: 44.13
<S> and it was no bad one i believe , since here we are ! i do not say , replied andrea , that you never make a good one ; but let us see your plan . well , pursued caderousse , can you without expending one sou , put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs ?: 41.40
<S> but i dined at m. de villefort s , and lawyers always give you very bad dinners .: 48.23
<S> my good fellow , you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold blooded policy . and this time it must be confessed that , contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men , the effective arguments were all on albert s side .: 60.58
<S> i listen to your eminence with greatest attention , replied a female voice which made the musketeer start .: 50.39

<S> i respected your father very much , said he .: 25.71
<S> then the danger was so imminent , the rioters came so near , uttering such threats , that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest , so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered .: 77.99
<S> i am not begging , my fine fellow , said the unknown to the servant , with so ironical an expression of the eye , and so frightful a smile , that he withdrew ; i only wish to say two or three words to your master , who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago . come , said andrea , with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation , what do you want ?: 37.92
<S> when he arose a second time , he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk .: 33.22
<S> it contained my fortune ! bills upon spain ? asked the disturbed host .: 102.17
<S> and yet it is difficult to suppose such a resemblance should exist between two jewels . do you know this ring ? said d artagnan .: 30.16
<S> this musketeer had just come off guard , complained of having a cold , and coughed from time to time affectedly .: 89.44
<S> grimaud replied by another sign that he understood perfectly , and set off .: 52.78
<S> you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time , valentine , but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere have i not obeyed ?: 73.45
<S> you told me that your instinct , and although you pretend to know nothing about speculations , i think on the contrary , that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs , well , you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the southern .: 53.93
<S> save the king , and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world , leave me the hope that we shall meet again , when i may be able to thank you myself .: 45.85
<S> forward , blaisois ! a groan , stifled by the grasp of porthos , was all the reply of poor blaisois , for the giant , taking him neck and heels , plunged him into the water headforemost , pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank .: 44.31
<S> then rising in despair , he exclaimed , the chief , the chief ! here i am , said vampa , instantly appearing ; what do you want ? take my last gold , muttered danglars , holding out his pocket book , and let me live here ; i ask no more for liberty i only ask to live ! then you suffer a great deal ? oh , yes , yes , cruelly ! still , there have been men who suffered more than you . i do not think so . yes ; those who have died of hunger . danglars thought of the old man whom , in his hours of delirium , he had seen groaning on his bed .: 42.21
<S> i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow . then we will not talk of it until tomorrow ; but read this paper today . i will not irritate him , thought edmond , and taking the paper , of which half was wanting , having been burnt , no doubt , by some accident , he read : this treasure , which may amount to two ... of roman crowns in the most distant a ... of the second opening wh ... declare to belong to him alo ... heir .: 76.76
<S> on reaching the courtyard , they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the gate .: 15.85
<S> i followed her , i caught her , i bound her ; and i imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon her that i had imprinted upon my poor brother .: 52.27
<S> she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case , and that you should take something to keep up your strength ; and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa , which was , like all the rest , covered with papers .: 38.46
<S> at that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all .: 41.61
<S> let us talk of those , if you please .: 12.71
<S> as soon as possible . i am at your command , sir ; shall we return together ? if not unpleasant to you . on the contrary , i shall feel much pleasure . thus , the future father and son in law stepped into the same carriage , and morrel , seeing them pass , became uneasy .: 45.77
<S> at the end of three months he had learned to read .: 13.25
<S> besides , you forget , c sar , an indigestion declares itself immediately , while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two . c sar gave way before such cogent reasoning , and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner .: 142.75
<S> he was superintending the grooming of his horse , and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden , when the count s carriage stopped at the gate .: 26.39
<S> why did you talk of a regiment , athos ?: 27.00
<S> that would not be endurable in any case , and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a liar . sir ! cried de chatillon .: 38.07
<S> the notary , after having , according to the customary method , arranged the papers on the table , taken his place in an armchair , and raised his spectacles , turned towards franz : are you m. franz de quesnel , baron d e pinay ? asked he , although he knew it perfectly .: 29.87
<S> one moment , said the prisoner , in french .: 26.83
<S> at this moment the coadjutor was announced ; a cry of surprise ran through the royal assemblage .: 23.70
<S> your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana , the huntress , and yet you are not content . no , for that very resemblance affrights me ; i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua ; but this chase loving diana , continually surrounded by her nymphs , gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of act on . and , indeed , it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerf s remark .: 86.63
<S> a carriage waits your orders , and ali and myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go .: 121.76
<S> a dinner in the old style .: 49.98
<S> it was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached .: 45.77
<S> the fragments of the jug broke , and after an hour of useless toil , dante s paused with anguish on his brow .: 32.09
<S> good evening , m. de morcerf . the countenance of this man , who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings , expressed the most perfect cordiality .: 34.48
<S> grimaud , bazin , mousqueton and planchet .: 32.21
<S> he remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower .: 29.42
<S> that is enough to drive away all my pains ; i could mount him with thirty balls in my body .: 60.16
<S> this oath was no longer a vain menace ; for the fastest sailor in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan , that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn .: 79.77
<S> how pale you are !: 18.76
<S> buckingham saw this apparition in the glass ; he uttered a cry .: 38.54
<S> ah , said he , here we are , at the last act of the tragedy .: 19.42
<S> the interests of that kingdom and those of england , though taking now diverse directions , are very nearly the same .: 124.29
<S> we should only be three , one of whom is wounded , with the addition of a boy , resumed athos ; and yet it will not be the less said we were four men . yes , but to yield ! said porthos .: 27.79
<S> morrel guessed all this .: 52.79
<S> now , said albert , that you have seen all my treasures , allow me to offer them to you , unworthy as they are .: 27.41
<S> but send me word should you be arrested , for then i will return directly . why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me ? no , i thank you . should we , by being arrested , be all four together again , we should not , i am not sure , be twenty four hours in prison without getting free . my friend , since i killed chatillon , adored of the ladies of saint germain , i am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly .: 62.87
<S> fernand mondego , count of morcerf , an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace . is it your father ? said beauchamp ; that is quite another thing .: 62.74
<S> there were a thousand ingots of gold , each weighing from two to three pounds ; then he piled up twenty five thousand crowns , each worth about eighty francs of our money , and bearing the effigies of alexander vi .: 46.99
<S> his father and mother were catholics , i believe ? his hatred of the king , who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of de winter . and what name does he now bear ? mordaunt . a puritan , yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in france . do you say as a monk ? it was thus , and by mere accident may god pardon me if i blaspheme that he heard the confession of the executioner of bethune . then i understand it all !: 67.14
<S> neffer , neffer ! d artagnan , seeing athos rise , did likewise , took his arm , and went out .: 29.69
<S> then one could enjoy charming little dinners , where one touches on one side the hand of a friend , and on the other the foot of a mistress .: 62.50
<S> oh , yes !: 8.91
<S> on the first story , do you see , there is the anteroom and the drawing room ; to the right of the drawing room , a library and a study ; to the left , a bedroom and a dressing room .: 25.37
<S> the woman followed him , and lord de winter did not appear .: 13.88
<S> oh ! he said , looking at the stone , this is the work of either hercules or porthos .: 38.04
<S> the extreme beauty of the countenance , that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it , was peculiarly and purely grecian ; there were the large , dark , melting eyes , the finely formed nose , the coral lips , and pearly teeth , that belonged to her race and country .: 122.53
<S> allow me to ask you a question : where are the plenipotentiaries ? at charenton , in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris . and was this conference arranged beforehand ? no , gentlemen , it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians . athos and aramis exchanged smiles ; for they well knew what those propositions were , to whom they had been made and who had made them .: 62.16
<S> astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient , and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed , she advanced towards valentine , and for the first time noticed the white lips .: 34.09
<S> they wish for secrecy , since we are to converse in a private room .: 46.52
<S> i am a dead man , he said , and fell from his horse to the ground .: 13.60
<S> ma foi ! i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired ; it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellow creatures .: 62.20
<S> he s a gascon .: 30.53
<S> he was a brave and an honest man . and a first rate seaman , one who had seen long and honorable service , as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel son , replied danglars .: 64.12
<S> but it is not the less true that that letter and planchet retired , shaking his head with an air of doubt , which the liberality of d artagnan had not entirely effaced .: 31.66
<S> d artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen were killed , and as many rochellais . what then ? the bodies were not plundered , were they ?: 63.98
<S> progress of cavalcanti the younger chapter 77 .: 161.69
<S> does that satisfy you ? said athos to his adversary .: 29.00
<S> the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy , and subsequently , when i learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people , and the entire life of individuals in the east , as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair , i have regretted that i was not a man , that i might have been a flamel , a fontana , or a cabanis . and the more , madame , said monte cristo , as the orientals do not confine themselves , as did mithridates , to make a cuirass of his poisons , but they also made them a dagger .: 56.21
<S> so , without losing time , tell me , have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds ? i think i have some clew . but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot . beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man , who was overwhelmed with shame and grief , the following facts .: 55.34
<S> d artagnan said nothing , but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake .: 48.58
<S> he confessed that he had undertaken with his comrade the same who was killed to carry off a young woman who was to leave paris by the barrie re de la villette ; but having stopped to drink at a cabaret , they had missed the carriage by ten minutes .: 43.36
<S> i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch .: 113.84
<S> it is thus that human weakness fails , from its debilitated and imperfect organs .: 101.33
<S> bless me ! cried porthos , making strong efforts to disembarrass himself of d artagnan , who was wriggling about his back ; you must be mad to run against people in this manner . excuse me , said d artagnan , reappearing under the shoulder of the giant , but i am in such haste i was running after someone and and do you always forget your eyes when you run ? asked porthos .: 54.53
<S> that man had the power to crush him , and yet he had not done so .: 18.19
<S> in vain were i an ambitious man should i struggle against such remembrances as he has left ; but that i am not ambitious i am going to prove to you .: 72.39
<S> his little gray eyes shone like carbuncles , and appeared , with his grinning mouth , to be the only part of his face in which life survived .: 54.75
<S> the worthy mercer had , immediately upon re entering his house , informed his wife of his happy return , and his wife had replied by congratulating him , and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit .: 66.42
<S> midnight struck .: 40.02
<S> the whole assembly manifested great surprise , but andrea appeared quite unmoved .: 87.71
<S> the weak man talks of burdens he can raise , the timid of giants he can confront , the poor of treasures he spends , the most humble peasant , in the height of his pride , calls himself jupiter .: 164.34
<S> and how did this misfortune occur ? inquired the latter , resuming the interrupted conversation .: 47.41
<S> bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city , between leu and dompierre ; the duc d angoule me on the east , from dompierre to perigny ; and m. de schomberg on the south , from perigny to angoutin .: 60.64
<S> monsieur morrel , said valentine to the young man , who was regarding her with the most intense interest , my grandfather , m. noirtier , had a thousand things to say , which he told me three days ago ; and now , he has sent for you , that i may repeat them to you .: 26.24
<S> oh , my beautiful sovereign , a hundred times , thanks ! oh , my lord !: 21.10
<S> to the installation of my rival at m. danglars . what rival ? ma foi ! what rival ?: 69.07
<S> i made them , but you know , my dear friend , madame du vallon porthos , in pronouncing these words , seemed to gulp down something .: 34.79
<S> on the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of paris , might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench , a book , a parasol , and a work basket , from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief , while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman , standing close to the iron gate , endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks , the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes , proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter .: 70.29
<S> only i warn you , that when i reside in a country , i conform to all its code , and i have no wish to put myself within the compass of the french laws for your sake . oh , do not do that , excellency ; i have always served you faithfully , cried bertuccio , in despair .: 38.65
<S> she should have wanted nothing . have you ever seen the queen of england ? inquired d artagnan .: 22.14
<S> i take that god to witness , at whose feet i have prostrated myself daily for the last ten years , that i would have sacrificed my life to you , and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with it .: 55.86
<S> grimaud made a sign that he was going away .: 10.82
<S> and this carte blanche , said d artagnan , this carte blanche , does it remain in her hands ? no , it passed into mine ; i will not say without trouble , for if i did i should tell a lie . my dear athos , i shall no longer count the number of times i am indebted to you for my life . then it was to go to her that you left us ? said aramis .: 40.61
<S> words might be heard at a distance through all these open doors .: 72.69
<S> his visit was announced to the governor , who , on hearing that he came from the cardinal , went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door .: 24.76
<S> comminges , villequier and guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the men .: 97.94
<S> an instant after , porthos and aramis re entered , the surgeon and m. de tre ville alone remaining with the wounded .: 31.47
<S> then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four heads . but observe , cried d artagnan , that there is a woman in the affair a woman carried off , a woman who is doubtless threatened , tortured perhaps , and all because she is faithful to her mistress . beware , d artagnan , beware , said aramis .: 56.13
<S> it led into the park , as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces .: 53.36
<S> but come , what is this about ? asked porthos .: 21.01
<S> quite , sir ; my master has ordered his horses at eight o clock precisely . very good , replied albert ; that is all i wished to know . then , turning towards beauchamp , if you have anything to attend to , beauchamp , do it directly ; if you have any appointment for this evening , defer it till tomorrow .: 31.19
<S> she reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return , and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others .: 81.74
<S> free ! chapter xxiv .: 41.89
<S> i shall be on the king s left and as i am the chief person threatened , remain at the coach door to the left . your eminence may be perfectly easy , replied d artagnan ; they will not touch a hair of your head . deuce take it ! he thought to himself , how can i take care of both ?: 41.89
<S> this is all i can say , sir ; if you wish to learn more , address yourself to m. de boville , the inspector of prisons , no .: 24.19
<S> given at constantinople , by authority of his highness , in the year 1247 of the hegira .: 97.13
<S> why did you not tell me so before ?: 19.66
<S> what art thou , then ?: 24.03
<S> porthos was perfectly indifferent ; athos , pale , but resolute ; aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his brow .: 47.12
<S> i have worn my cuirass these twenty years , kept down in this inferior rank , without going forward or backward , hardly half living .: 187.78
<S> he denies himself nothing ; it may easily be seen he has been accustomed to live well . never mind ; if his mistress abandons him , he will find friends , i will answer for it .: 38.54
<S> still further , in buckingham s lodging , which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected , papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which , as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs , strongly compromised mme .: 106.10
<S> albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress a jacket and breeches of blue velvet , silk stockings with clocks , shoes with buckles , and a silk waistcoat .: 64.74
<S> i should like to have seen the count take something in my house , if only an ice .: 50.76
<S> but i am not selfish , and i thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter .: 34.05
<S> now !: 28.55
<S> they mounted again at once , whilst looks of admiration passed between them .: 67.40
<S> i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune , without mercy or pity , and he was the least guilty of you all . with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved ; then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony , leaning over the balustrade , waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room .: 63.70
<S> alack !: 73.97
<S> for about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife , with two servants , a chambermaid named trinette , and a hostler called pecaud .: 55.22
<S> then they were both silent .: 23.93
<S> after some time cucumetto became the object of universal attention ; the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him .: 89.92
<S> and yet he said , to reassure himself , that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with mme .: 61.00
<S> yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed , but he was lost sight of at the corner of the rue de la jussienne and the rue coq he ron . villefort leaned on the back of an armchair , for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him ; but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him , he breathed again .: 55.47
<S> morrel had long thought of danglars , but had kept away from some instinctive motive , and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource .: 63.13
<S> pale and trembling , milady repulsed d artagnan s attempted embrace by a violent blow on the chest , as she sprang out of bed .: 53.36
<S> tut , tut ! answered the abbe , man is but man after all , and you are about the best specimen of the genus i have ever known .: 52.14
<S> de villefort , he said , will you conduct the baroness danglars ? villefort complied , and they passed on to the dining room .: 33.30
<S> my young man , said d artagnan , drawing his sword , that is an order sooner given than executed .: 36.13
<S> why , when a man has friends , they are not only to offer him a glass of wine , but , moreover , to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily ! fernand gave a groan , which resembled a sob , and dropped his head into his hands , his elbows leaning on the table .: 41.21
<S> are you there , now ? certes , replied aramis , in a pleased tone , but the thing is subtle . the fingers , resumed the jesuit , st .: 36.22
<S> but , after we had taken in our cargo , the wind became contrary , so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rho ne .: 30.55
<S> what ! said cromwell , arresting him for a moment as he arose ; is there nothing more you wish ?: 42.76
<S> we are not in the time of malatesta and castruccio castracani .: 54.12
<S> it was at night .: 23.23
<S> the audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude .: 63.59
<S> ah , my dear sir , you are most welcome ; i was expecting you . indeed , said the italian , was your excellency then aware of my visit ? yes ; i had been told that i should see you today at seven o clock . then you have received full information concerning my arrival ? of course . ah , so much the better , i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten . 30119m what precaution ? that of informing you beforehand of my coming . oh , no , it has not . but you are sure you are not mistaken . very sure . it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven o clock this evening ? i will prove it to you beyond a doubt . oh , no , never mind that , said the italian ; it is not worth the trouble . yes , yes , said monte cristo .: 30.94
<S> a present from an enemy is not a good thing .: 68.53
<S> it is 40,000 francs which i now owe you , said monte cristo .: 17.72
<S> i respect your convictions , and whilst we fight for opposite sides , let us remain friends .: 142.56
<S> i do not know you for one of us . then it is because you do not know your friends , my dear monsieur louvieres , said the coadjutor , raising his hat .: 15.93
<S> the night was dark , snow was falling , the streets were silent and deserted .: 46.19
<S> the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard ; some , belonging to the kitchens , gliding down the stairs , restored but the previous day , as if they had always inhabited the house ; others filling the coach houses , where the equipages , encased and numbered , appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years ; and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms , who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters .: 88.90
<S> till tomorrow evening , then ! till tomorrow evening , then ! replied i , allowing myself to fall , and biting the carpet with rage . felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture ; and milady saw , with the joy of a demon , that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital .: 60.52
<S> yes , i dare say ; verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the attendant of madame de chevreuse .: 51.61
<S> they are veritable sponges !: 87.90
<S> this is the matter : be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe .: 76.17
<S> he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat , which he handed to mordaunt .: 41.49
<S> but what happened after my departure ? how can i tell ! said kitty .: 29.71
<S> listen , morrel it is noon ; if valentine is not now dead , she will not die . how so ? cried morrel , when i left her dying ? monte cristo pressed his hands to his forehead .: 31.15
<S> all the mundane objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young man , particularly when that young man is a musketeer , had disappeared as if by enchantment ; and for fear , no doubt , that the sight of them might bring his master back to ideas of this world , bazin had laid his hands upon sword , pistols , plumed hat , and embroideries and laces of all kinds and sorts .: 66.51
<S> i am happy to see , m. beauchamp , that you are more sober than he was . sir , said m. beauchamp , albert was wrong , i acknowledge , to betray so much anger , and i come , on my own account , to apologize for him .: 26.33
<S> it was time , for the jailer was coming .: 23.50
<S> beside his taste for the fine arts , which luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude , he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm , was often angry and capricious , and always sarcastic .: 76.11
<S> the curtain , which had risen at the close of the scene with albert , again fell , and a rap was heard at the door .: 31.11
<S> but you remind me .: 22.89
<S> everything conspired to prove to d artagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him , and that a great misfortune had happened .: 28.24
<S> morrel , in a corner of the carriage , allowed his brother in law s gayety to expend itself in words , while he felt equal inward joy , which , however , betrayed itself only in his countenance .: 60.21
<S> the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible ; they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination .: 60.13
<S> the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail , but not without turning about several times , and each time making signs of a cordial farewell , to which edmond replied with his hand only , as if he could not move the rest of his body .: 71.00
<S> monte cristo approached the window , and saw maximilian and emmanuel alight .: 24.34
<S> m. noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter , mademoiselle de villefort ; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years , and has , by her devoted attention , fully secured the affection , i had almost said the gratitude , of her grandfather , and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion . the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain .: 56.62
<S> at daybreak , the telegraphs were set at work in all directions , and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of caderousse .: 78.14
<S> you are too noble not to understand me , and you understand me so well that you already yield , dear maximilian .: 39.35
<S> i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself .: 119.98
<S> they arrived without accident at the rue des fossoyeurs .: 13.79
<S> i will carry the letter in the lining of my coat , said planchet ; and if i am taken i will swallow it . well , but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission , said d artagnan .: 20.64
<S> all this savors of his eminence , a league off . but what is to be done ? said d artagnan .: 27.55
<S> where am i ? said she .: 11.38
<S> if i ever find him again and i will find him , i swear , were it in hell ! he was waiting for a woman , continued tre ville .: 27.85
<S> danglars , then , without taking a crown from his pocket , could save morrel ; he had but to pass his word for a loan , and morrel was saved .: 42.16
<S> franz followed albert with his eyes , and saw him mount the first step .: 26.20
<S> bonacieux ; you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take . i have his letters , said she .: 57.62
<S> although i was without mistrust , a vague fear seized me , and i tried to struggle against sleepiness .: 60.24
<S> having arrived before the pont du gard , the horse stopped , but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say .: 49.11
<S> now , recalling former times of mutual distress , i send you half my purse ; it is money to obtain which i made mazarin sweat .: 100.01
<S> the first opportunity you have , confirm her in her opinion ; it will be easy for you , as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other . i thank you for the warning , said the count ; i shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions . you will , then , come on saturday ? yes , since madame de morcerf invites me . you are very kind . will m. danglars be there ? he has already been invited by my father .: 28.60
<S> come , speak ; avow freely that you accuse him ! no , sire , but i say that he deceives himself .: 32.95
<S> she advanced some steps towards the staircase , and listened .: 33.24
<S> ah , monsieur , said he , after having vainly searched on the mantle piece and the shelves , i have not got any candles . take one of the carriage lamps , bertuccio , said the count , and show me the apartments . the steward obeyed in silence , but it was easy to see , from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled , how much it cost him to obey .: 43.93
<S> his eyes took a strange expression , and with the step of a tiger cat he advanced toward the hedge ; but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense , when a sonorous and short cry made him start , and attracted the attention of the musketeers .: 50.31
<S> sending their leave of absence will be proof enough that i authorize their journey . thanks , monsieur .: 115.37
<S> d artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many ; but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position , like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him .: 46.74
<S> i ought to have known you better by this time ; but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit , which bids us doubt . humph ! said porthos .: 63.05
<S> gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand , but which evidently concerned him .: 49.27
<S> had just granted to him with his estate of e pinay .: 71.69
<S> fortunately , i was so well concealed that he could not find me .: 24.97
<S> his hatred , like a powerless though furious wave , was broken against the strong ascendancy which merce de s exercised over him .: 76.28
<S> never mind ; be content , i will do my best .: 24.80
<S> listen , m. d avrigny , listen ! noirtier looked upon morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy , and thus fixed his attention .: 37.79
<S> yes , sir , and i think i have the honor of addressing count andrea cavalcanti ? count andrea cavalcanti , repeated the young man , accompanying his words with a bow .: 21.53
<S> hastily snatching up the lighted candle , i hurried to the staircase ; about midway a body was lying quite across the stairs .: 128.35
<S> now , in the opinion of d artagnan , it was certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off mme .: 22.76
<S> interrogate me , i entreat you ! where is your wife , in the first place ? why , did not i tell you she had been stolen from me ? yes , but yesterday at five o clock in the afternoon , thanks to you , she escaped . my wife escaped ! cried bonacieux .: 25.14
<S> the same as yesterday ? another nod on the part of grimaud .: 89.96
<S> tomorrow morning , answered the innkeeper .: 23.12
<S> valentine entered at this moment , and the formalities were resumed .: 37.07
<S> the prime minister , she said , is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time , without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the court . but richelieu never came in this manner , said the pertinacious boy .: 79.39
<S> m. bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing , and in the rapidity with which it was executed .: 83.39
<S> all i can say is , that if it be so , tis an ill turn , and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it . nonsense , returned danglars , i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it ; besides , you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces . no , you did not ! answered caderousse , you merely threw it by i saw it lying in a corner . hold your tongue , you fool ! what should you know about it ? why , you were drunk ! where is fernand ? inquired caderousse .: 44.25
<S> whether success rendered us imprudent , or whether we were betrayed , i know not ; but one evening , about five o clock , our little cabin boy came breathlessly , to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom house officers advancing in our direction .: 87.11
<S> the countess took albert to meet madame danglars .: 32.07
<S> there s another brave and excellent young man . do you know him ? asked the officer .: 23.14
<S> i can not tell you ; i don t know him . how !: 12.71
<S> well , where the devil are you going now ? cried athos .: 10.62
<S> i called on fernand , who sent me a hundred francs by his valet de chambre . then you did not see either of them ? no , but madame de morcerf saw me . how was that ? as i went away a purse fell at my feet it contained five and twenty louis ; i raised my head quickly , and saw merce de s , who at once shut the blind . and m. de villefort ? asked the abbe .: 31.24
<S> morrel , horrified , supported his head with one hand , and with the other pressed his heart , lest its beatings should be heard .: 30.48
<S> he was accompanied by another man , who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up , resembling a washing line .: 46.51
<S> this was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performing , a make up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors , who seen from one side , were the image of geniality , and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic ill temper .: 129.38
<S> the pharaon left calcutta the 5th of february ; she ought to have been here a month ago . what is that ? said the englishman .: 29.49
<S> oh , no ! exclaimed edmond , that will not be .: 17.05
<S> andrea had fled .: 44.87
<S> royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns .: 18.79
<S> he seemed to be quite overcome .: 23.11
<S> yes . where ? at the louvre . are you sure of it ? perfectly sure . who told you of it ? madame de lannoy , who is devoted to your eminence , as you know . why did she not let me know sooner ? whether by chance or mistrust , the queen made madame de surgis sleep in her chamber , and detained her all day . well , we are beaten !: 33.93
<S> noirtier let his head fall upon his chest , apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful ; then he closed one eye , in token of inquiry .: 57.33
<S> in the name of heaven ! cried the poor tutor .: 10.31
<S> the door was scarcely closed upon him , when the queen sank , half fainting , into the arms of her women .: 20.10
<S> i received a letter from him , the dear fellow , in which he even asked me for some small service , which , in fact , i rendered him .: 32.35
<S> inflexible man ! she murmured .: 44.74
<S> thou alone , on the contrary , knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily . the friends embraced .: 118.72
<S> therefore , if you part with m. baptistin , give me the refusal of him . by all means . that is not all ; give my compliments to your illustrious luccanese , cavalcante of the cavalcanti ; and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son , find him a wife very rich , very noble on her mother s side at least , and a baroness in right of her father , i will help you in the search . ah , ha ; you will do as much as that , will you ? yes . well , really , nothing is certain in this world . oh , count , what a service you might render me !: 39.63
<S> she escaped the cruisers of both nations , and arrived at boulogne without accident .: 57.94
<S> the porter at the palace was about to close the gates , but seeing such a handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the porch .: 51.60
<S> my faith , it was time that idea came into porthos s head .: 46.45
<S> during the examination of milady by the officer , as may well be imagined , milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances .: 59.09
<S> she calculated that to cross this corner of france and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three days .: 71.80
<S> no , monsieur , returned the count ; and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket , formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea .: 54.71
<S> here i am , my friends , replied d artagnan ; not only free , but in favor . tell us about it . this evening ; but for the moment , let us separate . accordingly , that same evening d artagnan repaired to the quarters of athos , whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of spanish wine an occupation which he religiously accomplished every night .: 40.63
<S> at what time ? six o clock . where ? at saint mande . who told you ? the count de rochefort . some one drew near .: 37.59
<S> he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold ; so that when he saw merely and simply , instead of the executioner he expected , only his commissary of the preceding evening , attended by his clerk , he was ready to embrace them both .: 46.63
<S> i can not resist doing so ; he must live . zounds ! replied d artagnan , why don t you give yourself up directly , feet and hands bound , to that wretch ?: 57.05
<S> ah , don t be angry , i beg of you , that would be useless ; you know what is agreed upon between you , athos and me .: 22.25
<S> my house ? oh , your excellency , it was not yours , then . whose , then ?: 34.52
<S> in this kind of game , not to kill is to let one s self be killed .: 90.07
<S> these people who are looking at us are only merchants , said athos , and are looking more at the cargo than at us . i shall not trust to that , said the lieutenant , and i shall make for the dunes as soon as possible . sandy hills about dunkirk , from which it derives its name .: 57.28
<S> arrived there , he fastened , according to the orders of his master , both horse and mule to the knocker of the procurator s door ; then , without taking any thought for their future , he returned to porthos , and told him that his commission was completed .: 43.09
<S> what the devil makes him glower thus behind him ? when de winter perceived them , in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapidity .: 42.24
<S> disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of bethune , and having confessed him , after having learned everything from him , he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his heart .: 53.82
<S> to be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty , but it is an obstacle to the recovery of power .: 79.35
<S> dante s sighed ; it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him .: 15.62
<S> thank you , sir , answered the young man , much moved .: 13.61
<S> no , aramis replied .: 14.91
<S> i never rightly understood those men , said the queen , as she watched him retiring from her presence ; and it is now too late , for in a year the king will be of age . in twenty four hours d artagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen ; and the one received his commission , the other his patent of nobility .: 51.44
<S> there was , to be sure , father joseph , but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice , such was the terror inspired by his gray eminence , as the cardinal s familiar was called .: 88.35
<S> apropos , said d artagnan , loud enough for the servant to hear him , are you satisfied with olivain ? yes , in some respects , tolerably well . olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent .: 49.82
<S> de gue mene .: 129.54
<S> i must tell you , resumed mazarin , that it is in a double envelope . i understand ; and i am to take off the first one when i have reached a certain place ? just so , take it and go .: 39.70
<S> well , said he , let us go to valentine ; i will give instructions to everyone , and you , m. de villefort , will yourself see that no one deviates from them . 40294m at the moment when d avrigny was returning to valentine s room , accompanied by villefort , an italian priest , of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone , hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of m. de villefort .: 40.91
<S> they threw themselves into each other s arms , embraced tenderly , and returned together to the house .: 36.97
<S> your eminence , he said , might have dispensed with your attendants ; the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it . and so , my dear count , said d artagnan , his eminence didn t actually insist on our attending him ; it is du vallon and i who have insisted , and even in a manner somewhat impolite , perhaps , so great was our longing to see you . at that voice , that mocking tone , and that familiar gesture , accenting voice and tone , athos made a bound of surprise .: 51.91
<S> i give you his very words ; and if the marquis chooses to be candid , he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him , when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter . 0091m that is true , answered the marquis .: 48.22
<S> non capisco do not understand , was the reply .: 52.68
<S> email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundation s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org contact section 4 .: 46.33
<S> his gravity made him look older than he was . well then , if we can get athos , all will be well .: 61.42
<S> at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m. de villefort , by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child . everything is possible , said monte cristo , rising from the bench on which he had been sitting ; even , he added in an inaudible voice , even that the procureur be not dead .: 49.29
<S> i wished to run to the window and call for help , but my legs refused their office .: 40.40
<S> he has seen him , said athos , in a low tone , to aramis .: 11.30
<S> alone and free to act as he wished , the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern , placed it on a stand , then went straight to the secretaire , felt the lock , and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing .: 54.59
<S> but pardon me , are you free ?: 24.41
<S> at this movement , which nobody opposed , he resumed a little courage , and ventured to draw up one leg and then the other .: 51.85
<S> gentlemen , he said to his escort , withdraw .: 27.46
<S> keep that ring for love of me .: 106.67
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> he relates that he met at brussels rochefort , the a me damne e of the cardinal disguised as a capuchin , and that this cursed rochefort , thanks to his disguise , had tricked monsieur de laigues , like a ninny as he is . a ninny , indeed ! said porthos ; but is the matter certain ? i had it from aramis , replied the musketeer .: 79.27
<S> either we shall be attacked , or not .: 57.10
<S> my grandfather intends leaving this house , said she , and barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another . but you , mademoiselle de villefort , you , who are necessary to m. noirtier s happiness i ? interrupted valentine ; i shall not leave my grandfather , that is an understood thing between us .: 67.11
<S> a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities .: 105.59
<S> it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak , except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it ; therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling companion .: 71.02
<S> parisians and frondeurs as they were , the two friends expected to find the same misery , the same fears , the same intrigue in the enemy s camp ; but what was their surprise , after passing saint denis , to hear that at saint germain people were singing and laughing , and leading generally cheerful lives .: 90.18
<S> felton , cried she , you are as great as judas maccabeus !: 53.59
<S> in the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic ; the second notary had also arrived .: 19.15
<S> he will inform against you .: 44.40
<S> my husband was a great friend , in 1814 or 1815 , of a sailor named edmond dante s .: 31.56
<S> the only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the london executioner .: 72.93
<S> come , said the count mildly , do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men , morrel !: 40.66
<S> pardon me , excellency , said peppino , placing his hand on the banker s shoulder ; people pay here before they eat .: 42.67
<S> oh , father , do not look in that way at me !: 24.24
<S> it is an old man s caprice ! and is there no means of making him revoke his decision ? yes , said madame de villefort ; and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will , which is now in prejudice of valentine , to be altered in her favor . the count , who perceived that m. and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables , appeared to pay no attention to the conversation , and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward , who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird s water glass .: 44.94
<S> no .: 17.05
<S> did you ever occupy yourself , said he to franz , with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants ?: 47.60
<S> well , i can weather the storm i , whom , notwithstanding , you tax with fear not with bravado , that is not my way ; but i am firm .: 87.67
<S> bonacieux and that the man was aramis .: 39.58
<S> m. de tre ville , being informed of this by his eminence , packed his portmanteau ; and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to paris , it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort .: 56.27
<S> doubtless he was accustomed to such reproaches , for he listened to me calm and smiling , with his arms crossed over his breast .: 36.57
<S> coquenard .: 51.74
<S> no , monsieur , replied the young man ; i will remain with monsieur le comte . adieu , then , to both , my good friends , said d artagnan ; may god preserve you !: 18.44
<S> we will not go till evening . this very much astonished the sailors , although , not one opposed it .: 56.50
<S> none of those interesting adventures fell in his way ; the lovely genoese , florentines , and neapolitans were all faithful , if not to their husbands , at least to their lovers , and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf ; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france , that they are faithful even in their infidelity .: 101.10
<S> the other leaned against a tree , supported there by the two valets , and was praying fervently , with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven .: 46.98
<S> he fell asleep again and another vision appeared .: 58.84
<S> we are about to ascertain , sire , replied d artagnan , as he rapidly left the room .: 16.72
<S> it was not poverty which had broken her spirit ; it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome .: 72.43
<S> only three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill , and i was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door ; so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror , holding my position , as it were , my conquest .: 52.99
<S> at the end of the breakfast franz took out his watch .: 16.31
<S> bonacieux , rising all in a tremble , supported herself upon her chair to avoid falling .: 77.13
<S> ? his granddaughter .: 413.36
<S> a strange thing is the mind , and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign , a word , a hope .: 73.39
<S> suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded , and at the same instant all the moccoletti were extinguished as if by enchantment .: 36.02
<S> and it will be even a disadvantage to you ; a left handed man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it .: 65.33
<S> she thanked them both with a smile .: 43.68
<S> do not speak so loud , madame ; he is there . he is there !: 22.84
<S> he had retired at one o clock under the pretense of being indisposed .: 28.49
<S> i am sorry , if you die , that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me . rochefort extended his hand to d artagnan , who took it .: 25.85
<S> noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse , rattling sound ; the old man s eyes sparkled , and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his child .: 36.22
<S> i went to france , with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life .: 29.01
<S> expiation chapter 112 .: 78.46
<S> it was time , for just as i jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a man of war .: 78.06
<S> at madame de villefort s proposition he instantly winked his eyes .: 39.29
<S> here ! cried the steward , here ! whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building .: 30.73
<S> i must take care . chapter xxxvii .: 24.46
<S> i shall get nothing from these fools , he muttered ; and i am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward .: 44.51
<S> on the contrary , gentlemen , we would assist you if it were necessary . what does he say ? grumbled porthos .: 18.41
<S> i will send you to constantinople . no , lest on the first demonstration i make in favor of mehemet ali , the sultan send me the bowstring , and make my secretaries strangle me . you say very true , responded debray .: 69.55
<S> it was only on the following day , at about ten o clock in the morning , as he was starting to call on m. deschamps , the notary , that he received from the postman a small billet , which he knew to be from valentine , although he had not before seen her writing .: 31.10
<S> the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum , and turned back on his road to paris .: 50.83
<S> the hotel de vendome was not less guarded than the hotel de bouillon , and presented as warlike an appearance .: 45.94
<S> julie , suitably dressed , and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes , received the count on his entrance .: 55.10
<S> m. noirtier had just sent for him , and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab , placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab horse .: 50.31
<S> bravo !: 16.42
<S> you see , sir , he is really dead , said the doctor ; this burn in the heel is decisive .: 35.49
<S> could the prisoners see each other ? he asked .: 44.65
<S> he preserved this opinion even after the feast , with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence ; but when in the evening he made his master s bed , the chimeras of planchet faded away .: 58.94

<S> you , aramis , why the devil did you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a cassock ?: 33.46
<S> ah , pardieu ! said beauchamp , with the paper in your hand , my friend , i need not tell you the cause of my visit . are you interested in the sugar question ? asked the editor of the ministerial paper .: 26.33
<S> have you not yet divined who he is ? what ? cried felton , he again he always he ?: 96.52
<S> life itself may be resolved into three words : erat , est , fuit . which means said d artagnan , who began to suspect the truth .: 107.04
<S> noirtier s eye remained immovable .: 22.47
<S> without your aid , continued he , repeating the count s words i should have been a dead man thrice dead . my antagonist took flight , replied de guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance .: 52.97
<S> aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud .: 71.23
<S> they carried a banner , on which could be read this strange device : we are seeking our king . the next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three houses .: 103.11
<S> d artagnan knew his part well ; he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it .: 64.09
<S> it had glided down it , tearing the robe , and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs .: 75.03
<S> this announcement was received in silence .: 36.65
<S> yes ; but first give me this letter . you have it already , for it was taken from me with some others which i see in that packet . stop a moment , said the deputy , as dante s took his hat and gloves .: 41.44
<S> i really must pray you to excuse me , but in truth i was not attending to the conversation . marquise , marquise ! interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast , let the young people alone ; let me tell you , on one s wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics . never mind , dearest mother , said a young and lovely girl , with a profusion of light brown hair , and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal , tis all my fault for seizing upon m. de villefort , so as to prevent his listening to what you said .: 72.65
<S> there was a moment of silence , during which the two men looked at each other , as if to make a preliminary acquaintance , after which d artagnan bowed , as a sign that he listened .: 16.54
<S> in the meantime , follow me . the cardinal alighted ; the three musketeers did likewise .: 28.45
<S> his quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking , and who still remained at the window .: 31.86
<S> now , my lord , he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony . only that ? said mazarin , his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for porthos s devotion without opening his purse ; only that ?: 51.24
<S> why does the boat go so fast ? asked i of my mother .: 62.93
<S> the face of the first was lost to parry in the darkness ; but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips parry started back in amazement .: 42.38
<S> these leaders had corn in abundance , and would not let them partake of it ; they adopted as a maxim for they , too , had maxims that it was of very little consequence that women , children , and old men should die , so long as the men who were to defend the walls remained strong and healthy .: 84.02
<S> your excellency is safe and sound ? asked the host .: 26.83
<S> at the top of the stairs , upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor , was traced in black ink a gigantic number 1. d artagnan knocked , and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside , he entered the chamber .: 61.28
<S> the sides of the walls seem to close in , even to press against him .: 91.19
<S> when do you want your twelve hundred francs ? said he to caderousse .: 22.20
<S> that reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous woman .: 36.85
<S> how did you get this passport ? when i went to ask m. de monte cristo for letters to the directors of the theatres at rome and naples , i expressed my fears of travelling as a woman ; he perfectly understood them , and undertook to procure for me a man s passport , and two days after i received this , to which i have added with my own hand , travelling with his sister . 50035m well , said euge nie cheerfully , we have then only to pack up our trunks ; we shall start the evening of the signing of the contract , instead of the evening of the wedding that is all . but consider the matter seriously , euge nie ! oh , i am done with considering !: 50.77
<S> it is not for nothing we are but twenty years old , above all if we were born at tarbes .: 49.76
<S> then a singular thing occurred .: 56.10
<S> in former days i had not only three friends , i had thirty ; at two and twenty one calls every man one s friend . well , sir , returned mazarin , prudence is a fine thing , but to day you might regret having been too prudent . my lord , pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their tongues . but you have been silent for twenty years , sir .: 76.40
<S> and perhaps his saddle , therewith . no , gentlemen , i have kept the harness , said porthos .: 46.13
<S> his service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together . ah , my dear father ! exclaimed andrea , evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure .: 31.15
<S> meanwhile , it was necessary at all hazards , in order to gain time , to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following day the day appointed by the judges .: 32.54
<S> all day he toiled on untiringly , and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone .: 55.08
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> this time , said athos , first breaking the silence , d artagnan has given us an excellent program , and the letter must be written at once . the devil !: 33.23
<S> tell me , may i shake hands with you , saying , beauchamp , acknowledge you have injured me , and retain my friendship , or must i simply propose to you a choice of arms ? albert , said beauchamp , with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man , let us first sit down and talk . rather , sir , before we sit down , i must demand your answer . albert , said the journalist , these are questions which it is difficult to answer . i will facilitate it by repeating the question , will you , or will you not , retract ? morcerf , it is not enough to answer yes or no to questions which concern the honor , the social interest , and the life of such a man as lieutenant ge ne ral the count of morcerf , peer of france . what must then be done ? 40174m what i have done , albert .: 62.22
<S> when i call you chevalier , it is in presenting you to my guests , that they may know who you are .: 35.04
<S> three days afterwards , this poor vulture , which has been very much indisposed since that dinner , suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds , and falls heavily into a fish pond .: 116.01
<S> i will so advantageously bestow 2,000 piastres , that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for peppino ; and during that year , another skilfully placed 1,000 piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his prison . and do you feel sure of succeeding ? pardieu ! exclaimed the man in the cloak , suddenly expressing himself in french .: 88.24
<S> edmond did not close his eyes .: 23.31
<S> he weighed the two angers in his brain that of the cardinal and that of the queen ; that of the cardinal predominated enormously .: 52.61
<S> i have the price ; and d artagnan threw the bag upon the table .: 22.03
<S> alas , he exclaimed , how can i restore the happiness i have taken away from these poor innocent creatures ?: 33.06
<S> milady had , then , made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her , and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure .: 40.08
<S> and you have a letter ? yes , there it is . give it to me , then . and monte cristo took the letter , which he opened and read .: 19.02
<S> did you ask for me , my good friend ? said m. de tre ville .: 10.52
<S> choose tyburn , madame .: 74.83
<S> the young man rang the bell violently ; the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle valentine s room , and the servant who had replaced barrois , ran in at the same moment .: 32.35
<S> she turned toward the wall to smile for there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her .: 51.86
<S> they were influenced by hatred , by avarice , and by self love ; but i was base , and for want of courage acted against my judgment .: 71.65
<S> but , said villefort , who was the first to break the silence , i consider that i am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question .: 24.80
<S> at this moment the door of the dining room unclosed with a creak , and porthos perceived through the half open flap the little clerk who , not being allowed to take part in the feast , ate his dry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and kitchen .: 64.65
<S> come , morrel , it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage .: 38.77
<S> he had made his valet cover him with honey ; then , opening a feather bed , he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine .: 82.92
<S> franz thanked the count for his attention .: 47.12
<S> at cha lons i was put upon the sao ne , thence i passed on to the rho ne , whence i descended , merely with the current , to arles ; at arles i was again placed on my litter , and continued my journey to marseilles .: 48.42
<S> sir , said she , that need not make you uneasy , however difficult it may at first sight appear to be .: 61.41
<S> it was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory .: 95.54
<S> you are not angry with me ? not the least in the world . till then , then ? till then . bonacieux kissed his wife s hand , and set off at a quick pace .: 23.51
<S> all at once he heard his bolts drawn , and made a terrified bound .: 54.55
<S> the bare idea would kill me would drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my finger nails !: 131.70
<S> an approaching battle was much spoken of , the prince having manoeuvred , until that movement , only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached him .: 97.85
<S> dante s followed him with his eyes , and stretched forth his hands towards the open door ; but the door closed .: 15.91
<S> besides , my lord must remember that monsieur de chavigny is governor of vincennes , continued la ramee , and that monsieur de chavigny is not friendly to monsieur de beaufort . yes , but monsieur de chavigny is sometimes absent . when he is absent i am there . but when you leave him , for instance ? oh !: 27.32
<S> i increased in wickedness till i committed crime .: 282.02
<S> and to all these questions poor kitty , forced to put on a pleasant face , responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark , solely because happiness is egotistical .: 141.53
<S> a minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open , and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns , and the supper laid under the tent .: 76.19
<S> the 5,000,000 you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand .: 92.70
<S> oh , if that were so , i should lose my reason ! and he folded her in his arms .: 29.85
<S> now , i am going to show you how sincere i am . good , thought d artagnan ; we must look about us ; he s going to play us a trick . i offered you your liberty , continued the minister ; will you take it ?: 40.25
<S> he was ushered into a simple and elegant drawing room , and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air .: 21.88
<S> she has experienced much anxiety ; but she is now at length a little reassured , having sent her secretary away in order that nothing may happen unexpectedly .: 86.95
<S> i wish it . then aramis , paler than before , but subdued by these words , snapped the serpent blade between his hands , and then folding his arms , stood trembling with rage .: 57.35
<S> the position in which he had left him was critical .: 32.07
<S> and the name of athos as well concealed the comte de la fe re , as the name milady clarik concealed anne de breuil .: 50.66
<S> at the sight of the diamond , which was as large as a hazel nut , la carconte s eyes sparkled with cupidity . and what did you think of this fine story , eavesdropper ? said monte cristo ; did you credit it ? yes , your excellency .: 16.80
<S> i know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword , while i am only moderately so ; i know , too , that you are a good marksman there we are about equal .: 49.05
<S> come , count , said raoul , who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the augustine ; come , i feel ill here , and the two young men spurred on .: 33.43
<S> i faith , no , said d artagnan ; i was not in voice ; monsieur du vallon has a cold and did not cry either .: 36.97
<S> the young man advanced rapidly into the chamber , leaving the door open behind him , and making a sign to milady to be silent ; his face was much agitated .: 17.97
<S> he will amass wealth , he will injure the king s revenue and pay to himself the pensions which richelieu paid to others .: 68.01
<S> now then , tell me , was any person present during your last conversation with captain leclere ? no ; we were quite alone . could your conversation have been overheard by anyone ? it might , for the cabin door was open and stay ; now i recollect , danglars himself passed by just as captain leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal . that s better , cried the abbe ; now we are on the right scent .: 66.52
<S> i promised you a letter for the director of the academy .: 17.56
<S> shall i complain of him ? demanded the inspector .: 17.95
<S> you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces , and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world .: 43.13
<S> lover and husband ah , madame , said d artagnan , entering by the door which the young woman opened for him , allow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of a husband . you have , then , overheard our conversation ? asked mme .: 30.72
<S> yes , sir , replied raoul , with slight hesitation ; i did not sleep well . you , raoul , not sleep well !: 32.39
<S> i would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces . and what will she do now ? asked the young man .: 29.11
<S> but you are not the king , my son , and can never be so while they are alive .: 28.61
<S> take care , albert , said franz .: 12.10
<S> she has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit may obtain his pardon .: 39.20
<S> thou must add , said d artagnan , that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the comte de la fere , and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest , then mention my name ! planchet , leading his horse by the bridle , drew near to the gate and rang the bell , and immediately a servant man with white hair and of erect stature , notwithstanding his age , presented himself .: 48.89
<S> do you , aramis , order the servants .: 47.63
<S> by demanding my head of the cardinal ? cried d artagnan , pale with terror .: 23.32
<S> ali had received his instructions , and went down the corso , crossed the campo vaccino , went up the strada san gregorio , and reached the gates of st. sebastian .: 28.52
<S> formerly they believed themselves sprung from jupiter , and shielded by their birth ; but nowadays they are not inviolable .: 153.76
<S> where do you come from ? oh , this is too much ! madame , these are my orders ; excuse me .: 28.76
<S> but this time , instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse , and advanced to meet d artagnan .: 23.20
<S> is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him ?: 25.77
<S> the treasure when dante s returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity , he found faria seated and looking composed .: 78.25
<S> no , replied d artagnan , if i recollect well what you said , it was nothing out of the common way . ah , you surprise me .: 26.57
<S> this good major cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris , which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire , when he was on his way to moscow .: 45.49
<S> an hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered , and this time it went to the rue fontaine saint georges , and stopped at no .: 35.76
<S> at least you don t speak well of him . that is because i am not his friend , said she , sighing , but his victim ! but this letter in which he recommends you to me ? is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison , from which he will release me by one of his satellites . but why have you not fled ? whither should i go ?: 43.02
<S> the prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day , for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his cell .: 55.04
<S> spada , a prudent man , and greatly attached to his only nephew , a young captain of the highest promise , took paper and pen , and made his will .: 97.88
<S> oh ! said i to him .: 29.43
<S> oh , sir , in the most natural way possible , replied he to whom they had given the title of count .: 29.02
<S> now , i travel a great deal , particularly on this road , and i wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune . it seems to me , said the host , that this is not the first time i have had the honor of seeing monsieur . bah , i have passed perhaps ten times through chantilly , and out of the ten times i have stopped three or four times at your house at least .: 30.80
<S> and now you will do me a favor , will you not ? what is it ? do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen ; and should they wish it , you will warn me . just then the count felt his arm pressed .: 25.90
<S> the whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure .: 21.25
<S> two hours later , thirty officiating ministers from the most populous , and consequently the most disturbed parishes of paris had assembled there .: 84.33
<S> no more theses , no more glosses upon the fingers or upon benedictions , hey ? aramis smiled .: 113.05
<S> the throng was terrific , and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination .: 121.78
<S> was it not i ?: 26.54
<S> one of them , hat in hand , said to him : would you believe it , monsieur ?: 23.12
<S> and therefore marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abbe and not from the good abbe himself . and that cavalier , that guest , that nobleman who arrived before she came ? it was i , the comte de la fere , said athos , rising and bowing respectfully to the duchess de chevreuse .: 61.71
<S> come !: 17.12
<S> tis very dear living in england , my lord , especially as envoy extraordinary . zounds ! replied mazarin , the people there are very sedate , and their habits , since the revolution , simple ; but no matter . he opened a drawer and took out a purse .: 80.72
<S> i am not allowed to see you , madame , but you shall every day hear of me .: 26.22
<S> remember , that was the only means .: 29.39
<S> the count flew to her to help , and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes , he ripped them open with his poniard , and in so doing laid bare her shoulder .: 64.66
<S> porthos had received a thrust through his arm , and bicarat one through his thigh .: 34.46
<S> next he went to the quai de feraille to have a new blade put to his sword , and then returned toward the louvre , inquiring of the first musketeer he met for the situation of the ho tel of m. de tre ville , which proved to be in the rue du vieux colombier ; that is to say , in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by d artagnan a circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his journey .: 30.43
<S> and to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter , said debray .: 20.58
<S> danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear , and an inkstand in place of a heart .: 64.40
<S> madame danglars was chatting at a short distance with debray , beauchamp , and cha teau renaud .: 19.98
<S> however , the last two or three years i had allowed myself some respite .: 49.89
<S> he had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection the conversation he had heard between the doctor and villefort the night of madame de saint me ran s death , recurred to him ; these symptoms , to a less alarming extent , were the same which had preceded the death of barrois .: 42.91
<S> the diminutive abbe scarron , who , however , was an abbe only because he owned an abbey , and not because he was in orders , had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of mans , which he inhabited .: 60.81
<S> you are free , you leave the count s house , and you take your mother to your home ; but reflect , albert , you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her .: 50.85
<S> but what raised public astonishment to a climax , and set all conjecture at defiance , was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the alle es de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans , and afterwards observed to enter a poor fisherman s hut , and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years .: 77.13
<S> at the second turn , a bunch of fresh violets , thrown from a carriage filled with harlequins , indicated to albert that , like himself and his friend , the peasants had changed their costume also ; and whether it was the result of chance , or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both , while he had donned their costume , they had assumed his .: 63.68
<S> one is for seven o clock , and the other for eight ; there will be time for both . hum !: 41.40
<S> if my pardon be complete , we shall return triumphant to yanina ; if the news be inauspicious , we must fly this night . but supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so ? said my mother .: 67.35
<S> the duke walked so fast that d artagnan had some trouble in keeping up with him .: 37.17
<S> m. de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man . there is , then , one , said monte cristo , whom you do not condemn like poor danglars ? because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps , replied albert , laughing .: 39.78
<S> milady seemed overcome with joy , and made kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the soubrette with de wardes when he received the letter ; how he had responded ; what was the expression of his face ; if he seemed very amorous .: 64.78
<S> we were but the instruments , that is all . but as to free will , aramis ? how acts the judge ?: 64.97
<S> during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office , and wrapped the corpse in the winding sheet , which , whatever may be said about the equality of death , is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life .: 60.70
<S> i am not willing it should be known i have left the camp ; and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell nobody . we are gentlemen , monseigneur , said athos ; require our parole , and give yourself no uneasiness .: 42.74
<S> there is everything in a jesuit convent . then you would have killed monsieur de marsillac if he had come alone to attack you , instead of at the head of twenty men ? undoubtedly , said aramis , and even at the head of his twenty men , if i could have drawn without being recognized . god pardon me ! said d artagnan to himself , i believe he has become more gascon than i am ! then aloud : well , my dear aramis , do you ask me why i came to seek you ? no , i have not asked you that , said aramis , with his subtle manner ; but i have expected you to tell me . well , i sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill monsieur de marsillac whenever you please , prince though he is . hold on !: 37.49
<S> you understand , baron , my grandfather wishes you to read this paper , said valentine .: 26.35
<S> it must have lost its ferocity in the second generation .: 53.89
<S> more than that , we shall have a tempest , or i don t know what s what . you could see the wind coming like the dust at montredon ; luckily the captain understood his business .: 57.88
<S> ah , thanks , felton , thanks ! the young man pressed her to his heart .: 18.82
<S> thou hast no confidence in me !: 59.21
<S> d artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room , the three musketeers and the two guards following him .: 25.00
<S> he remained motionless , but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury .: 26.48
<S> porthos called him drunk , and the stranger drew his sword .: 30.17
<S> it was very polite of you . come , said andrea , what do you want ? you do not speak affectionately to me , benedetto , my old friend , that is not right take care , or i may become troublesome . this menace smothered the young man s passion .: 32.17
<S> what does he want with me ? said monte cristo .: 7.53
<S> to be sure ; for monsieur de wardes . now , there is one , said kitty , who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor monsieur d artagnan . go to bed , mademoiselle , said milady ; i don t like comments . d artagnan heard the door close ; then the noise of two bolts by which milady fastened herself in .: 44.30
<S> say to her : peace or war !: 190.30
<S> you know we can not yet pronounce him guilty . he is in safe custody , answered villefort ; and rely upon it , if the letter is found , he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again , unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman . and where is the unfortunate being ? asked rene e .: 50.60
<S> madame de villefort was dead .: 12.09
<S> not a whisper , not a breath , was heard in that vast assembly ; everyone waited anxiously .: 96.31
<S> it is twenty years since i saw them , and yet whenever i have seen the king in danger i have thought of them . and these men were your friends ? one of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me .: 26.59
<S> she who , mistaking you for the cardinal s guards , has just fled away . your companion ! cried d artagnan , becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress .: 37.43
<S> i look around the boat , expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart . oh !: 83.58
<S> why ?: 22.65
<S> as for grimaud , his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow .: 35.84
<S> i have an old affair to settle with him when i am cured and sound again .: 41.63
<S> religion and its observances had made felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions .: 168.92
<S> i imagined it must be , said morrel .: 20.68
<S> morrel , however , extended his arm , and commanded silence .: 41.35
<S> twenty guards , well mounted , are all that i shall need for my escort . that is very few , said the marshal .: 57.40
<S> how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians ? my good friend , as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence , it would ill become me to search too closely into its source ; therefore , instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws , you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection ; not altogether for preserving my life , for my own idea was that it never was in much danger , but certainly for saving me 4,000 piastres , which , being translated , means neither more nor less than 24,000 livres of our money a sum at which , most assuredly , i should never have been estimated in france , proving most indisputably , added albert with a laugh , that no prophet is honored in his own country . talking of countries , replied franz , of what country is the count , what is his native tongue , whence does he derive his immense fortune , and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy ?: 109.08
<S> halt ! he cried , this time we shall be pursued .: 34.27
<S> d artagnan continued : before god and before men , i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me , in wine which she sent me from villeroy , with a forged letter , as if that wine came from my friends .: 91.38
<S> my eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth , and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches .: 32.68
<S> i was going to say that i received a letter almost to the same effect . you ? yes . from the abbe busoni ? no . from whom , then ? from an englishman , called lord wilmore , who takes the name of sinbad the sailor . and of whom you have no more knowledge than i of the abbe busoni ? you are mistaken ; there i am ahead of you . you have seen him , then ? yes , once . where ? ah , that is just what i can not tell you ; if i did , i should make you as wise as myself , which it is not my intention to do . and what did the letter contain ? read it . you are poor , and your future prospects are dark and gloomy .: 32.72
<S> no , my child , no , said madame de saint me ran ; but i was impatiently waiting for your arrival , that i might send for your father . my father ? inquired valentine , uneasily .: 18.09
<S> this is fine ! said porthos to himself ; i am prettily caught ! he passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves , and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of mme .: 68.90
<S> why , he said , does he enter without first asking for an audience ? anne colored slightly .: 45.29
<S> i understand , said porthos .: 9.93
<S> furthermore , d artagnan went with them , leaving porthos at play with groslow .: 71.62
<S> he answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head .: 43.04
<S> if the serpent be dead , why not its brood ?: 73.46
<S> bonacieux was explaining her devotion , and that she had freed her from that prison ; and the letter he had received from the young woman , and her passage along the road of chaillot like an apparition , were now explained .: 55.24
<S> i do not feel remorse , because that woman , i profoundly hold , deserved her punishment .: 64.13
<S> my god ! silence ! both remained suspended , motionless and breathless , within twenty paces of the ground , while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking .: 61.24
<S> what could she have done to you ?: 17.84
<S> hallo ! continued caderousse , half rising , and with his fist on the table , hallo , edmond !: 33.17
<S> i will summon him hither . it is useless ; he would not come up . to your apartments , perhaps ; but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine . the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street , and whistled in a peculiar manner .: 34.30
<S> 23 germain pillon was a famous french sculptor 1535 1598 .: 365.04
<S> speak , said charles , attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him .: 56.70
<S> you said prince , did you not ?: 37.77
<S> and he darted on beside his friend , who had already begun a fresh pursuit .: 45.19
<S> patrick , said the duke , bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were kept . patrick brought the object desired , which laporte recognized as having belonged to the queen .: 57.86
<S> i remained in the room and waited . oh , heaven ! 30271m when daylight dawned i went down again .: 78.69
<S> however , he added , turning to porthos , i should not regret dying , sir , were i sure that by doing so i might still be useful to you . mouston , replied porthos , much affected , should we ever see my castle of pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm . and you should call it devotion , added aramis ; the vineyard of self sacrifice , to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your master . chevalier , said d artagnan , laughing , you could eat a piece of mouston , couldn t you , especially after two or three days of fasting ? oh , no , replied aramis , i should much prefer blaisois ; we haven t known him so long . one may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert athos from the scene which had just taken place , the servants , with the exception of grimaud , were not silent .: 70.86
<S> if he wanted valentine , he closed his right eye only , and if barrois , the left .: 99.63
<S> and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed , he said , by way of changing the conversation , you pass your life in travelling ? yes .: 65.41
<S> on perceiving mazarin he bowed .: 51.37
<S> the prince was , therefore , contrary to his custom , gloomy and anxious , when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him .: 37.75
<S> hear the end .: 72.03
<S> and now , my lord , that i see how hopeless the position of the king is , tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband . well , then , madame , said de winter , the king wishes you to try and discover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him . alas !: 24.04
<S> perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march . if they are penitent , said athos , let them follow us . well ! said the king , what shall we do ? let us examine the enemy s army . at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle .: 48.64
<S> besides , in accepting it , she added , in a voice full of emotion , you render me a much greater service than you imagine . this woman is full of mysteries , murmured d artagnan to himself .: 28.40
<S> where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital ? faubourg saint germain , said cha teau renaud .: 47.41
<S> but felton that s another thing .: 91.39
<S> a presentiment instantly told d artagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous ; the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently .: 47.85
<S> the king called the cardinal .: 20.60
<S> if only for the sake of m. de salvieux , who recommends him to me , i entreat your majesty to receive him graciously . m .: 31.88
<S> two or three years perhaps . so much the better , cried porthos .: 20.08
<S> this man , in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman , had become an admirable jailer .: 50.86
<S> d artagnan knelt as well as the rest , received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross ; but when bazin passed in his turn , with his eyes raised to heaven and walking , in all humility , the very last , d artagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe .: 39.33
<S> oh ! he said , i fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of orleans .: 33.85
<S> many citizens , seeing the women flying toward the high street , leaving their children crying at the open doors , hastened to don the cuirass , and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan , directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller , before which was gathered , increasing every minute , a compact group , vociferous and full of curiosity .: 86.12
<S> the only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself .: 63.92
<S> but your release can be managed .: 79.69
<S> who would have come to the assistance of two strangers , two unknown persons ?: 60.89
<S> nevertheless , i carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which i spoke just now , and which sudden chance frequently brings about . while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder , the mind of dante s was , in fact , busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent , ingenious , and clear sighted as the abbe might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes , where he himself could see nothing .: 88.83
<S> are you an angel ? and the young man , who had never shrunk from danger , shrank before monte cristo with indescribable terror .: 33.87
<S> well , then it appears that we are the cr suses of the society .: 32.55
<S> the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight , but they were forced , when the door was open , to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices .: 44.22
<S> go , said he ; the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time i have no need of your service .: 40.90
<S> but , would you believe it , he was not receiving . so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty .: 70.86
<S> one day , when the king had halted to fly the magpie , and the four friends , according to their custom , instead of following the sport had stopped at a cabaret on the high road , a man coming from la rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine , and darted a searching glance into the room where the four musketeers were sitting .: 33.26
<S> in short , it was you who have but now in this chamber , seated in this chair i now fill , made an engagement with cardinal richelieu to cause the duke of buckingham to be assassinated , in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate d artagnan . milady was livid .: 55.16
<S> what do you say to this project ? the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt , and his smile remained as it ever was false and flattering ; and when the queen finished speaking , he said : do you think , madame , that france , agitated and disturbed as it is , would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king ?: 52.60
<S> athos smiled .: 12.79
<S> monsieur d artagnan ! cried mousqueton , his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy ; monsieur d artagnan !: 34.42
<S> i acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me , and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me . and as he spoke these words with a hoarse , choking voice , he staggered towards the door , which was mechanically opened by a door keeper .: 39.96
<S> first and foremost , dear d artagnan , we have no title such as count here .: 98.78
<S> the pilot again changed the course of the boat , which rapidly approached the island , and was soon within fifty paces of it .: 38.16
<S> he also , morrel , like you , considered himself the unhappiest of men . well ? asked morrel .: 44.07
<S> the countess left the arm of monte cristo , and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes .: 23.23
<S> when the maltese for so they called dante s had said this , it was sufficient , and all went to their bunks contentedly .: 96.05
<S> it was four o clock when dante s was placed in this chamber .: 13.78
<S> during our expedition to be thune the husband of my duchess died ; so , my dear , the coffer of the defunct holding out its arms to me , i shall marry the widow .: 72.59
<S> now , should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him , will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices ? with the rapid instinct of selfishness , caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning ; he gazed , doubtfully , wistfully , on danglars , and then caution supplanted generosity .: 108.51
<S> he will , perhaps , hold me in greater esteem than the money itself , seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him .: 46.17
<S> that worthy prince .: 115.27
<S> darling , replied valentine , has not the count just told us that all human wisdom is summed up in two words : wait and hope fac et spera ! footnotes : 1 the wicked are great drinkers of water ; as the flood proved once for all . 2 2,600,000 in 1894 .: 253.74
<S> the count followed her with his eyes .: 11.79
<S> this is recent news , sir , continued she , and i thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me ; without this letter i should not have heard till to morrow , perhaps after to morrow the last of all paris . madame , said raoul , the louvre is but the second palace this news has reached ; it is as yet unknown to all , and i had sworn to the count de guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even i should embrace my guardian . your guardian !: 50.21
<S> where , and how ? that s true ! fore gad , these frenchmen have no consideration ! i had forgotten that england was an island , and that you were the king of it . go to the riverside , ask for the brig sund , and give this letter to the captain ; he will convey you to a little port , where certainly you are not expected , and which is ordinarily only frequented by fishermen . the name of that port ? st .: 75.69
<S> when he drew near to the bedroom door , monte cristo expected that he was coming in , and raised one of his pistols ; but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings .: 32.30
<S> and i renew my promise .: 36.20
<S> i then was ready to dismount , but it was too late ; i descended into the arms of the archers .: 22.18
<S> raoul had offered some opposition at first ; but d artagnan made use of the comte de la fere s name , and after paying a visit to madame de chevreuse , raoul started to rejoin the army .: 29.37
<S> father , said benedetto , i am asked for proofs , do you wish me to give them ? no , no , it is useless , stammered m. de villefort in a hoarse voice ; no , it is useless ! how useless ? cried the president , what do you mean ? i mean that i feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes me .: 25.32
<S> it was , indeed , peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door , and placing between his legs an earthen pan , containing chick peas stewed with bacon .: 92.45
<S> de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man ; and the spaniard , who had advanced to meet raoul , aimed in his turn , and raoul felt a pain in the left arm , similar to that of a blow from a whip .: 50.35
<S> it is you , bernouin , she said .: 21.17
<S> porthos and aramis regarded each other , not understanding this assurance of athos .: 41.76
<S> lift it , and judge if i am mistaken . the young man raised the arm , which fell back by its own weight , perfectly inanimate and helpless .: 41.42
<S> he was called count , he was said to possess 50,000 livres per annum ; and his father s immense riches , buried in the quarries of saravezza , were a constant theme .: 57.54
<S> a terrible fear transfixed him .: 60.95
<S> as for myself , i shall be proud to face the bullets , or even the rope , in company with you , athos ; for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are to day . d artagnan said nothing , but , after having gnawed the flower stalk , he began to bite his nails .: 47.88
<S> if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business , you must assist me by the most minute information on every point . pray ask me whatever questions you please ; for , in good truth , you see more clearly into my life than i do myself . in the first place , then , who examined you , the king s attorney , his deputy , or a magistrate ? the deputy . was he young or old ? about six or seven and twenty years of age , i should say . so , answered the abbe .: 45.51
<S> after some search , i found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed , and at the hearth . yes , said the count , yes . i raised the stones , and found a rope ladder and some tools ? how do you know that ? asked the guide in astonishment .: 47.24
<S> oh , yes , she cried , i do love you !: 14.95
<S> he besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion , were it even the mad abbe .: 96.38
<S> you need not look for it ; i do not want it , said the old man .: 12.33
<S> i see your features regain their calmness , your countenance recovers its assurance .: 127.68
<S> that admiration is , on the contrary , so great , so real , madame , returned mazarin , without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen , that if the king , charles i. whom heaven protect from evil ! came into france , i would offer him my house my own house ; but , alas !: 69.43
<S> with your belt , my lord ! replied la ramee .: 19.08
<S> do you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a year in this amusement ?: 32.85
<S> indemnity you agree to indemnify and hold the foundation , the trademark owner , any agent or employee of the foundation , anyone providing copies of project gutenberg electronic works in accordance with this agreement , and any volunteers associated with the production , promotion and distribution of project gutenberg electronic works , harmless from all liability , costs and expenses , including legal fees , that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur : a distribution of this or any project gutenberg work , b alteration , modification , or additions or deletions to any project gutenberg work , and c any defect you cause .: 24.40
<S> grimaud drew out a pistol .: 25.64
<S> this look of porthos s made the gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning .: 69.17
<S> as he spoke , and in the very direction he indicated , a groan , expressive of bitter grief , was heard , and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel about to sail .: 47.13
<S> to the world and to his servants danglars assumed the character of the good natured man and the indulgent father .: 60.50
<S> that s all right , said the man ; hop in , and we re off !: 33.09
<S> she has lost a tooth , next to the eyetooth on the left ? yes . the fleur de lis is small , rosy in color , and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices ? yes . but you say she is english ? she is called milady , but she may be french .: 64.77
<S> come , have you committed some crime , pursued by human justice , from which i can protect you ? the beggar shook his head .: 34.10
<S> i do not recollect it , said hayde e .: 10.38
<S> here it would be dangerous ; the house may be watched .: 46.72
<S> the old man s declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort ; she gradually approached the invalid , and said : then , doubtless , dear m. noirtier , you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson , edward de villefort ? the winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible , and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred .: 54.37
<S> buckingham at once remembered the circumstance , and suspecting that something was going on in france of which it was necessary he should be informed , he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was , and recognizing from afar the uniform of the guards , he put his horse into a gallop , and rode straight up to d artagnan .: 43.80
<S> but , he said , the count s generosity is too overwhelming ; valentine will be satisfied with my humble fortune .: 29.57
<S> my god ! he exclaimed , thy vengeance is sometimes delayed , but only that it may fall the more effectually . ali looked at his master for further instructions .: 70.07
<S> oh , i never make matches , my dear prince , it is my settled principle . andrea bit his lips .: 39.45
<S> villefort retained his place , but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity .: 72.89
<S> you , count , who are more than mortal , will , i am sure , lead me to death by a pleasant path , will you not ? 50267m my friend , said the count , i have still one doubt , are you weak enough to pride yourself upon your sufferings ? no , indeed , i am calm , said morrel , giving his hand to the count ; my pulse does not beat slower or faster than usual .: 32.72
<S> he shed the blood of strafford ; that confirms what i said just now blood will have blood .: 124.51
<S> in that earnest look might be read a deep reproach , as well as a terrible menace .: 68.37
<S> no vampire , cried beauchamp .: 46.21
<S> oh , i am a christian , cried dante s , guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him .: 17.01
<S> the abbe replaced the large spectacles , which covered not only his eyes but his temples , and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same .: 42.06
<S> m. coquenard poured from a very small stone bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men , served himself in about the same proportion , and passed the bottle to porthos and mme .: 59.38
<S> he was at least forty ; and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present .: 33.53
<S> st .: 139.44
<S> oh no !: 131.09
<S> he had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning ; he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his room the red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinal so that he might have the pleasure of hanging mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish .: 70.04
<S> i passed the day and the night in prayer , for i hoped that god would pardon me my suicide .: 49.04
<S> i have served them without enthusiasm god knows that i estimated them at their real value , and that they are not high in my esteem but on principle .: 80.81
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> how !: 23.93
<S> you thought to make us , unhappy strangers , trot at the heels of your processions , like so many lazzaroni , because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city .: 109.22
<S> i have never been understood , and no wonder .: 37.39
<S> nevertheless , the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed mordaunt .: 108.54
<S> yes , to a convent . and to which ? i don t know ; the secret has been well kept . but i will know ! and your eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is ? i can see nothing inconvenient in that , said the cardinal .: 41.02
<S> if i did not fear to fatigue you , said the general , evidently charmed with the count s manners , i would have taken you to the chamber ; there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators . i shall be most grateful , monsieur , if you will , at some future time , renew your offer , but i have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess , and i will therefore wait . ah , here is my mother , cried the viscount .: 32.85
<S> adieu , chevalier . adieu , countess . commend me to the cardinal . commend me to satan . milady and rochefort exchanged a smile and separated .: 61.83
<S> i thought you might want it to show the abbe busoni . well , when you receive the remaining 40,000 , you shall give me a receipt in full .: 40.69
<S> pardon me , said albert , i was not aware that he was a prince .: 16.51
<S> i think we are all taken prisoners , except aramis , and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarin s mousetrap . which is far too strong for two of us , but not strong enough for three of us , returned d artagnan .: 69.75
<S> what more ? well i i m not rich .: 89.53
<S> he had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals , and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell .: 34.77
<S> you agree that the foundation , the trademark owner , and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual , direct , indirect , consequential , punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage .: 14.90
<S> yes , said aramis .: 6.81
<S> how absurd as if one crown were not as good as another .: 73.09
<S> i am choking !: 42.23
<S> monsieur d arminges , who was at the door , perceived his hesitation .: 20.18
<S> athos , on his part , had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a thoroughly peculiar fashion , and who was named grimaud .: 42.75
<S> she appeared to take a great interest in him , asked him whence he came , who were his friends , and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the cardinal .: 45.94
<S> m. danglars dined with me . i know it ; to avoid meeting him , my mother and i left town . but he met here m. andrea cavalcanti . your italian prince ? not so fast ; m. andrea only calls himself count . calls himself , do you say ? yes , calls himself . is he not a count ? what can i know of him ?: 70.07
<S> sir ! cried the man , in the name of heaven put your sword back into the sheath and don t kill me unheard .: 38.86
<S> planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse , which sank down .: 58.72
<S> that s what i wanted to know .: 19.63
<S> no , replied athos , with a singular smile .: 7.79
<S> the bell and bottle tavern chapter 99 .: 45.58
<S> villefort , franz , and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary .: 79.73
<S> this was our resolution ; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate , in which i intended to carry off valentine to my sister s house , to marry her , and to wait respectfully m. de villefort s pardon . no , said noirtier .: 31.43
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> each one , on awaking , would find himself on the field of battle .: 26.25
<S> he hastened to the side door with ali , entered hurriedly , and by the servants staircase , of which he had the key , gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain , without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house , which he supposed empty , contained its chief occupant .: 99.01
<S> at the extremity of the courtyard , where , close to a portico formed of ionic columns , were the dog kennels , rose an oblong building , the pavilion of the orangery , a half circle , inclosing the court of honor .: 48.04
<S> without caring about them myself , i live among those who are much occupied in them .: 77.33
<S> in my house , murmured he , in my house ! come , magistrate , said m. d avrigny , show yourself a man ; as an interpreter of the law , do honor to your profession by sacrificing your selfish interests to it . you make me shudder , doctor .: 50.55
<S> sir , he said , turning to athos , was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the duchess de chevreuse , and is she not the queen ? no , vicomte , said madame de chevreuse , taking his hand and making him sit near her , while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure ; no , unhappily , i am not the queen .: 23.92
<S> beauchamp was in his bath .: 23.66
<S> some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning .: 87.82
<S> saved ! exclaimed the man with gray hair , who also touched bottom .: 73.39
<S> at this word athos and aramis jumped up .: 22.64
<S> as they went from the ho tel des gardes , they separated , leaving the street at opposite ends , one having to quit paris by the barrie re de la villette and the other by the barrie re montmartre , to meet again beyond st. denis a strategic maneuver which , having been executed with equal punctuality , was crowned with the most fortunate results .: 56.86
<S> night came ; dante s hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him , but he was mistaken .: 46.66
<S> so can i , said the englishman , and he laughed too ; but he laughed as the english do , at the end of his teeth . and so , continued the englishman who first gained his composure , he was drowned ? unquestionably . so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time ? precisely . 20027m but some official document was drawn up as to this affair , i suppose ? inquired the englishman .: 75.79
<S> this chancellor was a pleasant man .: 26.57
<S> and alone ? no , my lord , madame has visitors . have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame , or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito ? no , indeed , replied monte cristo with a smile , i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing . and who is with madame ? m .: 42.00
<S> mazarin , still sombre and pensive , permitted himself to be dragged along in this way ; it looked a race of phantoms .: 78.53
<S> they found raoul near his tent , reclining on a truss of hay , of which his horse stole some mouthfuls ; the young man s eyes were red and he seemed dejected .: 49.14
<S> absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast radiance ; but his father , a sun pluribus impar , left his personal splendor to each of his favorites , his individual value to each of his courtiers .: 106.00
<S> as he entered the chamber of his friend , dante s cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels , but nothing more than common met his view .: 64.64
<S> most certainly , but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant , this dear child and myself must both have perished . indeed , i still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in . i trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your man . i beseech you , madame , replied monte cristo not to spoil ali , either by too great praise or rewards .: 69.45
<S> it was time two hours after he was delirious ; the next day he died . and what did you do then ? what i ought to have done , and what everyone would have done in my place .: 29.26
<S> morrel seized their hands , and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs : on your knees on your knees he is our benefactor the saviour of our father !: 73.27
<S> just as he turned , a hand rested on his shoulder , and a voice which made him shudder exclaimed : good evening , maximilian ; you are punctual , thank you ! ah , is it you , count ? said the young man , in an almost joyful accent , pressing monte cristo s hand with both his own .: 26.22
<S> for a year he had held this rank , and expected promotion on the first vacancy .: 94.79
<S> the best !: 39.91
<S> i am incredulous . the queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there , and presented it to the cardinal .: 42.65
<S> thus , we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .: 26.64
<S> on my soul , handsome stirrups !: 58.91
<S> i asked , said athos , in the same language , if there are two parliaments , a pure and an impure ? why , how extraordinary ! said porthos , slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment , i understand english , then !: 35.57
<S> you see , it s evident where the count got the name . but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me ? in the first place , because i had spoken much of you to him , as you may believe ; and in the second , because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success . i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him ? i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not .: 71.73
<S> violence , he said to himself , would spoil all ; d artagnan , my friend , prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger , but more subtle than he is . ah ! he said , making a low bow , why did you not begin by saying that , monsieur mordaunt ?: 41.16
<S> ah , yes , he said , as if awaking from a dream .: 18.92
<S> how do i know ?: 12.02
<S> alas , returned villefort , i must ! where , then , are you going ? asked the marquise .: 14.98
<S> this gun had an excellent barrel , made at brescia , and carrying a ball with the precision of an english rifle ; but one day the count broke the stock , and had then cast the gun aside .: 73.05
<S> in fact , a moment later m. morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the pharaon , who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship ; and as dante s was universally beloved on board his vessel , the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own .: 85.12
<S> are we to pass the night in the king s room ? asked d artagnan .: 11.13
<S> fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air , but did not say a word .: 20.30
<S> how could this ring come into the hands of milady clarik ?: 31.13
<S> lucien looked at her for a moment in silence .: 23.95
<S> since he had been taken he had not uttered a word , so that it was not known to what country he belonged .: 26.92
<S> you suit me very well . baptistin bowed low .: 39.48
<S> the ballet of la merlaison chapter xxiii .: 17.56
<S> my brother edward , who inherits nothing from his mother , will , therefore , be poor in comparison with me .: 40.61
<S> i was still unable to divine for what reason m. de villefort had this spade in his hands , when he stopped close to the thicket where i was , glanced round , and began to dig a hole in the earth .: 38.55
<S> monte cristo is a little island i have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employed a grain of sand in the centre of the mediterranean , an atom in the infinite . precisely ! cried albert .: 61.74
<S> m. bonacieux had opened his door , and seeing the apartment , had returned to the man in the cloak , whom he had left alone for an instant .: 19.40
<S> my lackey and i will have three shots at you , and you will get as many from the cellar .: 35.65
<S> besides , our supper can t delay you much .: 91.20
<S> fatality .: 101.49
<S> richelieu remained standing , leaning against the mantelpiece ; a table was between him and d artagnan .: 29.35
<S> all the world was ignorant of it .: 15.69
<S> to the wall ; to the wall ! and the four friends , seconded by grimaud , pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall , which bent as if pushed by the wind , and detaching itself from its base , fell with a horrible crash into the ditch .: 50.20
<S> adieu ; i go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other . the abbe with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of caderousse , opened the door himself , got out and mounted his horse , once more saluted the innkeeper , who kept uttering his loud farewells , and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming .: 80.01
<S> it is not of him that i am now thinking .: 24.30
<S> morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness ; monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live , and so far he had always fulfilled his word .: 41.86
<S> courage , take courage , my dear mother ! said the girl .: 21.09
<S> what has just happened . yes , said the count , you are right it is miraculous . for albert is brave , resumed morrel .: 33.07
<S> a woman lay on the ground , her head resting on the knees of a man , who was seated by her ; as he raised his head , the woman s face became visible .: 23.00
<S> he must have been dreadfully hurt , for he did not stir from the place where he fell .: 31.73
<S> if they were not yet to be seen , it was because the road made an elbow .: 43.17
<S> you will take a biscuit with it , will you not ? yes , i will take a biscuit , as you are so obliging . monte cristo rang ; baptistin appeared .: 22.78
<S> why are not my frenchmen here ? he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment ; they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive , and of their tears when dead . well , said the president , seeing that charles was determined to remain silent , so be it .: 64.40
<S> oh , my lord ! continued the queen , without restraining her tears , it is better to fight as the king has done , and to die , as perhaps he will , than live in beggary like me . courage , madame !: 42.90
<S> on the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then ; those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become brothers .: 122.51
<S> the king , excited by the cardinal , made a terrible clamor .: 34.53
<S> i went to him and told him all ; he knew me , that man did , and did not doubt an instant .: 30.91
<S> it was necessary to separate .: 20.69
<S> they then advanced two and two , and saluted each other politely .: 38.37
<S> that is all i had to say to you . and i reply to you , sir , that this abuse of power , this exile under a fictitious name , are infamous ! would you like better to be hanged in your true name , milady ?: 42.33
<S> meanwhile danglars , repressing all emotion , advanced to meet the receiver general .: 90.50
<S> you understand , my dear girl , continued d artagnan , she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came in . oh , my god !: 25.72
<S> the count turned around , and fancied he saw him in the corridor , rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge .: 36.91
<S> his family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him .: 77.56
<S> the very madness of the abbe faria , gone mad in prison , condemned him to perpetual captivity .: 63.19
<S> in business , sir , said he , one has no friends , only correspondents . it is true , murmured the englishman ; then you have but one hope . but one . the last ? the last . so that if this fail i am ruined , completely ruined ! as i was on my way here , a vessel was coming into port . i know it , sir ; a young man , who still adheres to my fallen fortunes , passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house , in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me ; he has informed me of the arrival of this ship . and it is not yours ? no , she is a bordeaux vessel , la gironde ; she comes from india also ; but she is not mine . perhaps she has spoken to the pharaon , and brings you some tidings of her ? shall i tell you plainly one thing , sir ?: 56.88
<S> then he advanced ; but before they could meet , the vessel again changed her course .: 67.41
<S> well , then ? said aramis .: 7.99
<S> the queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them , for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of misfortune .: 60.49
<S> there is none , said athos .: 12.39
<S> ah , added the count , in a contemptuous tone , do not tell me of european punishments , they are in the infancy , or rather the old age , of cruelty . really , count , replied franz , one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world . there are , at least , few that i have not seen , said the count coldly .: 31.35
<S> have you killed the cardinal ?: 15.02
<S> if you like , replied the latter .: 12.73
<S> at last , after traveling two days and a night , they arrived at boulogne toward the evening , favored by magnificent weather .: 56.71
<S> but his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way they killed time for him till eight o clock in the evening ; then would come night , and with night , sleep .: 91.08
<S> that mazarin was contemptible and that i wouldn t serve mazarin .: 93.86
<S> that comforts me a little . has he wit or not this demon d artagnan ? said porthos , astonished at his friend s deception .: 54.96
<S> you do not belong to the human species ; you are a demon escaped from hell , whither we send you back again . ah , you virtuous men ! said milady ; please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin . the executioner may kill , without being on that account an assassin , said the man in the red cloak , rapping upon his immense sword .: 69.43
<S> well , here we are at last , said one of them .: 12.14
<S> at the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the bastion .: 25.36
<S> god bless his majesty ! yes , repeated the leader in a whisper , god bless his majesty ! and all these men , who had entered enraged , passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their turn .: 51.08
<S> in about half an hour the girls went away , and maximilian understood that mademoiselle danglars visit had at last come to an end .: 50.96
<S> but she waited in vain .: 28.10
<S> aramis had some slight inclination to resume the cassock .: 48.21
<S> elssler was dancing in le diable boiteux ; the greek princess was in ecstasies .: 180.71
<S> that gascon has saved a queen and made monsieur de richelieu confess that in point of talent , address and political skill , to him he was only a tyro . really ? it is as i have the honor of telling it to your excellency . tell me a little about it , my dear monsieur de rochefort . that is somewhat difficult , my lord , said rochefort , with a smile .: 39.07
<S> to be decapitated ?: 84.73
<S> arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast , he approached athos and said , showing him the airhole of the cellar : sausages ! athos began to laugh , for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person .: 75.57
<S> he therefore drew near to the table and took the second glass .: 21.36
<S> your excellency s carriage is at the door , said he .: 13.07
<S> monsieur d artagnan , said the cardinal , on perceiving him , i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me .: 15.16
<S> then everything was still , excepting that valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied .: 119.39
<S> he redoubled his gayety and carelessness .: 71.30
<S> he is really king of paris ; he can t go out without being mobbed by his admirers . ah !: 39.20
<S> it was the soul of my husband ! well , if my husband s soul can come to me , why should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter ?: 55.14
<S> workmen were immediately called in , and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house .: 62.04
<S> on descending , we saw through the lattice work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view .: 109.32
<S> dante s made no resistance ; he was like a man in a dream ; he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment ; he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps ; he was conscious that he passed through a door , and that the door closed behind him ; but all this indistinctly as through a mist .: 43.93
<S> the young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories ; but vampa reassured her with a smile , tapping the butt of his good fowling piece , which threw its ball so well ; and if that did not restore her courage , he pointed to a crow , perched on some dead branch , took aim , touched the trigger , and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree .: 62.67
<S> it was written and signed by albert .: 42.33
<S> she goes into england , said athos .: 20.74
<S> d artagnan at once comprehended that this was his recompense .: 22.70
<S> grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully .: 35.53
<S> but at the first word the young woman started , and exclaimed in a sharp , bantering tone , which sounded strangely in the darkness , are you afraid , dear monsieur d artagnan ? you can not think so , dear love ! replied d artagnan ; but now , suppose this poor comte de wardes were less guilty than you think him ? at all events , said milady , seriously , he has deceived me , and from the moment he deceived me , he merited death . he shall die , then , since you condemn him ! said d artagnan , in so firm a tone that it appeared to milady an undoubted proof of devotion .: 33.32
<S> the good george ! said she , closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and melancholy .: 29.00
<S> to horse !: 49.26
<S> he esteems me highly .: 68.24
<S> the cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed ; the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps .: 71.31
<S> my lord ! said the queen , you bring us three things which we have not seen for a long time .: 24.92
<S> it seems to me , said d artagnan , with a thousand livres each i do not speak as a spartan , but as a procurator this word procurator roused porthos .: 50.82
<S> these arrangements made , the lackeys retired .: 117.77
<S> then the officer , with the same calm politeness , invited his prisoner to enter the house .: 29.29
<S> ah , ah ! cried one of the guards , will you persist in saying , most discreet aramis , that you are not on good terms with madame de bois tracy , when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of her handkerchiefs ? aramis darted at d artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that he has acquired a mortal enemy .: 54.73
<S> for fear that anyone should be observing her return , she walked slowly ; and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate , she seated herself on a bench , and , carefully casting her eyes around , to convince herself that she was not watched , she presently arose , and proceeded quickly to join maximilian .: 47.16
<S> nevertheless , whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker , or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey , she resolutely drew near to aramis s shutter , and tapped , at three equal intervals , with her bent finger .: 65.36
<S> the rowers waited , their oars half lifted out of the water , like birds drying their wings .: 62.58
<S> she tried to go toward the window for air , but she could only stretch forth her arms ; her legs failed her , and she sank into an armchair .: 32.86
<S> i also was married at the death bed of my mother , and certainly i have not been less happy on that account . still that idea of death , madame , said villefort .: 32.60
<S> moreover , he had this advantage , he was master of the count s secret , while the count had no hold on franz , who had nothing to conceal .: 38.69
<S> a puritan only adores virgins , and he adores them by clasping his hands .: 99.77
<S> now , this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer to our readers , restoring it to the title which belongs to it , and entering into an engagement that if of which we have no doubt this first part should obtain the success it merits , we will publish the second immediately .: 56.40
<S> to a parisian accustomed to silken curtains , walls hung with velvet drapery , and the soft perfume of burning wood , the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room , the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream .: 99.12
<S> well , planchet , how is the good monsieur de wardes ?: 24.18
<S> ah , my dear fellow , said albert , rising , and lighting his third cigar , really , i thought you had more courage . so saying , the two young men went down the staircase , and got into the carriage .: 22.58
<S> instantly afterwards four carbineers , on horseback , appeared on the edge of the wood ; three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive , while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck .: 55.43
<S> often in prison faria had said to him , when he saw him idle and inactive : dante s , you must not give way to this listlessness ; you will be drowned if you seek to escape , and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion . these words rang in dante s ears , even beneath the waves ; he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength .: 56.53
<S> his fear was lest the governor , touched with pity , might order him to be removed to better quarters , and thus separate him from his young companion .: 109.10
<S> the nations took attila , who was doomed to destroy them , for a conqueror similar to other conquerors , and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions , that they might be known and acknowledged ; one was compelled to say , i am the angel of the lord ; and the other , i am the hammer of god , in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed . then , said villefort , more and more amazed , and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman , you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned ? and why not ? said monte cristo coldly .: 55.50
<S> in the meanwhile , he looked upon athos as an achilles , porthos as an ajax , and aramis as a joseph .: 49.56
<S> d artagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet .: 91.78
<S> noirtier , the redoubtable , was the next morning poor m. noirtier , the helpless old man , at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the household , that is , his grandchild , valentine ; a dumb and frozen carcass , in fact , living painlessly on , that time may be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its decay . alas , sir , said monte cristo this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought .: 76.91
<S> only remember on the 5th of october , morrel , i shall expect you at the island of monte cristo .: 30.76
<S> everything was ready at ten o clock for the departure , and as athos was watching raoul mount , a groom rode up from the duchess de chevreuse .: 39.07
<S> the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests , and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves , and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears , as would have been the case with a father , a brother , or a lover .: 54.50
<S> let us understand each other , my lord , replied d artagnan , and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake .: 24.43
<S> grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook , which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened .: 86.21
<S> the discourse being finished , the queen remained silent .: 32.33
<S> eh , egad , to give up broussel as they demand !: 94.85
<S> the woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill milady ? yes , milady ; it is true you called her thus . what has the monk to do with this milady ? she was his mother . grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner .: 50.12
<S> say on . you will permit me to make one remark ? certainly ; pray do so . then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress . indeed , said the major , regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction .: 41.12
<S> germain , a glass of sherry and a biscuit .: 39.68
<S> i must go thither tonight ? instantly !: 85.77
<S> bonacieux , placing her hand upon her bosom , my heart beats so i can not walk . courage , courage !: 37.14
<S> on arriving at the extremity of the castle d artagnan found himself overlooking a beautiful valley , in which , at the foot of a charming little lake , stood several scattered houses , which , humble in their aspect , and covered , some with tiles , others with thatch , seemed to acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau , built about the beginning of the reign of henry iv. , and surmounted by four stately , gilded weather cocks .: 70.32
<S> besides , on pressing occasions , in extreme difficulties , d artagnan would become the preserver of his friends .: 54.25
<S> madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which , looking up , sees the murderous trap closing over its head .: 71.62
<S> the duc de beaufort .: 13.41
<S> your advice , then , is to sell the diamond , replied aramis .: 20.71
<S> you cursed host !: 220.85
<S> this fawn colored hair , or , perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women , gave her the name of la lionne . mademoiselle paulet took her accustomed seat , but before sitting down , she cast , in all her queen like grandeur , a look around the room , and her eyes rested on raoul .: 94.54
<S> and another , i carry all my effects with me ?: 87.86
<S> they found him holding his leave of absence in one hand , and m. de tre ville s note in the other .: 27.89
<S> and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man , without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind ; for , naturally enough , it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner . the name of m. noirtier , interposed maximilian , is celebrated throughout europe ; he was a statesman of high standing , and you may or may not know , valentine , that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons . oh , i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange the father a bonapartist , the son a royalist ; what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics ?: 100.92
<S> do you hear ? ah , valentine , said maximilian , give me but one finger through this opening in the grating , one finger , the littlest finger of all , that i may have the happiness of kissing it . maximilian , we said we would be to each other as two voices , two shadows . as you will , valentine . shall you be happy if i do what you wish ? oh , yes ! valentine mounted on a bench , and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening .: 55.44
<S> i felt some degree of nervousness as i entered upon the history of the diamond , but , to my inexpressible astonishment , he confirmed it in every particular , and to my equal surprise , he seemed to place entire belief in all i said .: 81.27
<S> he seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed , and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie .: 32.96
<S> there was no longer any doubt : the treasure was there no one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket .: 50.30
<S> well , as after my death the command devolves on you as mate , assume the command , and bear up for the island of elba , disembark at porto ferrajo , ask for the grand marshal , give him this letter perhaps they will give you another letter , and charge you with a commission .: 70.73
<S> what ?: 20.58
<S> think not i contented myself with this one effort , continued villefort .: 70.11
<S> nothing is impossible . on paper . in execution .: 138.08
<S> yes , said dante s ; do you know him ? no , replied villefort ; a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators . 0103m it is a conspiracy , then ? asked dante s , who after believing himself free , now began to feel a tenfold alarm .: 35.06
<S> merce de s is not yet your wife .: 26.47
<S> still , as five o clock approached , and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count , the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner .: 49.02
<S> m. de villefort went to the door , which he closed behind the child , and bolted .: 17.76
<S> you have one second to decide , said he .: 31.56
<S> i might as well say count benedetto .: 113.22
<S> at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening ; dante s seized his gun , sprang through the opening , and mounted the stair .: 26.68
<S> what is done is done .: 41.97
<S> caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen andrea go down the three stories , but also cross the court .: 82.02
<S> he means , replied the man upon his return , that he got in that way ; and he showed the hole i had made when i broke through .: 60.67
<S> six arabs came up , full gallop , to cut off my head .: 71.67
<S> as to the time , it will not require very much more than the generality of wills .: 34.09
<S> then we must fly ! said he .: 23.15
<S> this excess of bilious humor could not be attributed to play ; for unlike porthos , who accompanied the variations of chance with songs or oaths , athos when he won remained as unmoved as when he lost .: 106.80
<S> dante s spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice ; he had tried to speak when alone , but the sound of his voice terrified him .: 24.07
<S> you must try to see her , and have an explanation with her .: 28.69
<S> one day you acknowledged that you loved me , and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you , for to gain you would be life to me .: 64.40
<S> as the count was immensely rich , excepting the danger carmela had run , and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped , made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real misfortune , the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle .: 66.03
<S> there only remains , then , the question of the five shillings to be settled .: 58.49
<S> the count of monte cristo is always an early riser ; and i can answer for his having been up these two hours . then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly ? 20155m oh , i am quite sure .: 59.01
<S> he was , however , the same cocles , good , patient , devoted , but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic , the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world , even against m. morrel ; and strong in the multiplication table , which he had at his fingers ends , no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him .: 79.67
<S> she evidently interrogated him by her look .: 69.00
<S> tomorrow , then , monsieur tomorrow . till then , god preserve your majesty ! however ill the king might sleep , m. de tre ville slept still worse .: 70.17
<S> i noticed them for their remarkable beauty . then how comes it , said monte cristo with a frown , that , when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris , there is another pair , fully as fine as mine , not in my stables ? at the look of displeasure , added to the angry tone in which the count spoke , ali turned pale and held down his head .: 59.80
<S> let us go in , said monte cristo .: 6.19
<S> de chevreuse had been in paris , but still further , that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a cabal ; when he affirmed that he , the cardinal , was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue ; that at the moment of arresting in the very act , with all the proofs about her , the queen s emissary to the exiled duchess , a musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently , by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law , charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king louis xiii .: 76.22
<S> the chancellor made a profound reverence .: 42.29
<S> at your age we have faith in life ; it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope , but old men see death more clearly .: 93.33
<S> do you not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love ? true , replied franz .: 42.68
<S> let us die , then , as de winter has died ; as for me , i will fly only on condition that we all fly together . impossible , said d artagnan ; we are under mazarin s orders . i know it and i have nothing more to say ; my arguments lead to nothing ; doubtless they are bad , since they have not determined minds so just as yours . besides , said aramis , had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like d artagnan and porthos .: 53.46
<S> this , reckoning his loss , and what he had missed gaining , made the difference of a million to danglars .: 86.10
<S> the young lady went towards madame morrel .: 31.04
<S> what can i do ?: 9.88
<S> this recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph .: 64.22
<S> would to heaven !: 171.82
<S> hayde e , said he , did you read it ? oh , my lord , said she , why are you writing thus at such an hour ?: 17.48
<S> why , on making a thrust at my adversary , whom i had already hit three times , and whom i meant to finish with the fourth , i put my foot on a stone , slipped , and strained my knee . truly ? honor !: 66.65
<S> it was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the first .: 18.11
<S> mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant hatred .: 52.23
<S> and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 3,000 francs . child ! sighed merce de s .: 66.77
<S> thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist ; and the more respectable your fist is , porthos , the less attractive it is .: 138.06
<S> what , planchet , is monsieur d artagnan here ? here i am , my friend , dear athos ! cried d artagnan , in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation .: 23.91
<S> the cardinal was , as we have said , in very low spirits ; and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others .: 37.86
<S> to have you as long as possible near me , to hear your eloquent speech , which embellishes my mind , strengthens my soul , and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things , if i should ever be free , so fills my whole existence , that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you , has no longer any hold over me ; and this this is my fortune not chimerical , but actual .: 67.30
<S> there was certainly enough in all this to turn a head only twenty three years old , and mme .: 44.42
<S> has anything particular happened in the neighborhood ?: 70.88
<S> and moreover , my dear child , continued d artagnan , i am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian . i do not understand you , sir , said raoul .: 16.44
<S> porthos alone made no reply .: 25.90
<S> athos and d artagnan watched their approach from the window .: 21.26
<S> d artagnan did the same .: 11.81
<S> i , the offspring of a noble family , who placed reliance upon your friendship i was near dying of my wounds at first , and of hunger afterward , in a beggarly inn at chantilly , without you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters i addressed to you . but , monsieur porthos , murmured the procurator s wife , who began to feel that , to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time , she was wrong .: 55.15
<S> and that is the only reply you make ?: 39.12
<S> besides , should it be necessary , monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided . mazarin bit his lips ; the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly : all this appears to me to be ill conceived , disjointed , gentlemen ; for if i satisfy some i shall displease others .: 90.30
<S> i supplicate you , i implore you on my knees let me die , and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver . hearing that voice , so sweet and suppliant , seeing that look , so timid and downcast , felton reproached himself .: 58.04
<S> it consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of dante s , with the passage which united them .: 46.10
<S> since i became an abbe i dream of nothing but battles . that is apparent in your surroundings ; you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste .: 133.80
<S> in getting introduced to her , my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at court . the part she plays , pardieu ! it is not difficult to divine that , after all you have told me .: 74.75
<S> but when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men , and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment , try to find your affectionate heart , which you leave with your stick when you go to the chamber . but tell me , said beauchamp , what is life ?: 44.37
<S> you see , then , why i must decline your polite invitation , which is especially attractive to me , because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person ; the chances always balance and at the month s end nothing is gained or lost . ah ! said groslow , sighing ; there is something still more wearisome , and that is not to play at all . i can understand that , said d artagnan .: 61.47
<S> but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between lucien s visit and the curiosity of the baroness .: 34.17
<S> but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens , who , seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed , would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence .: 85.02
<S> cha teau renaud and albert looked at each other with amazement ; the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin .: 40.46
<S> the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory .: 99.17
<S> what will monsieur de tre ville say ?: 21.45
<S> and you are happy ? he said to his friend .: 15.66
<S> what ? said porthos .: 10.35
<S> she revives ! cried the young man .: 26.01
<S> have you proof of this ? i had it . and you have lost it ; how stupid ! yes ; but by careful search it might be recovered . really , returned the count , relate it to me , for it begins to interest me . and the count , humming an air from lucia , went to sit down on a bench , while bertuccio followed him , collecting his thoughts .: 48.68
<S> maximilian , said she , maximilian , my friend , my brother on earth , my true husband in heaven , i entreat you , do as i do , live in suffering ; perhaps we may one day be united . adieu , valentine , repeated morrel .: 35.72
<S> make use of it , i pray you , for your pleasure or your business . the young men wished to decline , but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them .: 47.51
<S> she terminated it by an action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation ; this was a blow with her fan , applied with such force that the little feminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces .: 80.24
<S> many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt , and m. de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count , a warning he might not be able to send another time , if this first attempt should fail and another be made . the count s first idea was that this was an artifice a gross deception , to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater .: 75.74
<S> he therefore approached the bed , and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime , he uncovered the calm and pale face , which looked like that of a sleeping angel .: 50.30
<S> my lord asks of what country you are , said the young man , in the purest castilian .: 31.22
<S> still , added he , amid all this , i have not yet been presented to mademoiselle euge nie danglars , whose acquaintance i should have been glad to make .: 25.66
<S> if that is the case , i warn you , i shall have you put in a lunatic asylum . alas !: 26.61
<S> to lift their hands against a minister of god . come here , sir , said urban , an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke in all his campaigns ; come here , there is nothing to be done with him , whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other . the wounded man smiled sadly .: 38.69
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> what took place at armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occasion .: 105.97
<S> faster , faster ! he cried , in a tone which electrified the coachman .: 28.69
<S> you too , then , are unhappy ? she said .: 32.70
<S> why , really , the thing becomes more and more dramatic explain yourself . i must refer again to the club in the rue saint jacques . it appears that this club is rather a bore to the police .: 62.87
<S> then he came to the corridor , all the doors of which he found open ; so , too , was the door of athos s chamber and that of the park .: 33.46
<S> at ten o clock every one was in his appointed position ; at half past ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day .: 38.89
<S> my adored valentine , words can not express one half of my satisfaction . valentine had approached , or rather , had placed her lips so near the fence , that they nearly touched those of morrel , which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier .: 77.50
<S> he has about him a little of that foreign manner by which french persons recognize , at first sight , the italian or german nobleman .: 118.52
<S> are you ill ? inquired the young man , much alarmed .: 21.22
<S> d artagnan and the englishman chapter xxxi .: 20.74
<S> because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise . and yet , said porthos , neither of them had any advantage over us .: 50.14
<S> almost immediately bertuccio entered the apartment .: 47.84
<S> the sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber .: 28.91
<S> ah , if your excellency chose , said the captain , you might have capital sport . where ? do you see that island ? continued the captain , pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea .: 48.09
<S> dante s let go of the timber , which he now thought to be useless , and swam vigorously to meet them .: 44.47
<S> monte cristo drew out his watch .: 15.41
<S> it appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence . my chaise broke down coming into lilliers . capital ! what , capital ? yes , i want your chaise . and how shall i travel , then ? on horseback . you talk very comfortably , a hundred and eighty leagues ! what s that ? one can do it !: 67.93
<S> they passed in silence through the little village of festubert , where the wounded servant was , and then skirted the wood of richebourg .: 49.10
<S> why are the glass and decanter empty ? asked he ; valentine said she only drank half the glassful . the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes .: 134.05
<S> he acquiesced , therefore , and chose the hundred pistoles , which the englishman paid down on the spot .: 45.76
<S> halloo , gentlemen ! he called out in his gascon accent , what do you want ?: 28.83
<S> what does it signify to you if i am murdered ?: 22.69
<S> our athos , who was as virtuous as scipio ?: 113.60
<S> not a modern picture among them .: 184.66
<S> he tore his hair .: 23.26
<S> at any other time valentine would have seized the silken bell pull and summoned assistance , but nothing astonished her in her present situation .: 123.01
<S> four of these men were our musketeers , preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just received .: 45.43
<S> just so , replied aramis .: 19.31
<S> if he is here this is what the other man said let s see decidedly what to do with him . what to do with him ? answered the prince .: 66.25
<S> the two nobles saluted each other politely , for if no friendship existed between them , there was at least esteem .: 61.13
<S> the duchess remained a moment stupefied ; then , suddenly bursting into laughter : ah !: 51.77
<S> soon as kitty left him , d artagnan directed his steps toward the rue fe rou .: 20.98
<S> he has lost four or five vessels , and suffered by three or four bankruptcies ; but it is not for me , although i am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs , to give any information as to the state of his finances .: 30.99
<S> for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started ; but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right , made a circuit , and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop .: 53.29
<S> we have our clothes , some more splendid than others , this is our credit ; but when a man dies he has only his skin ; in the same way , on retiring from business , you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions , at the most ; for third rate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be , like the locomotive on a railway , the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it .: 56.82
<S> bah !: 30.36
<S> the king made his entrance into paris on the twenty third of december of the same year .: 66.41
<S> strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man , and at times gave it the appearance of life .: 42.71
<S> but you will remain ; you are not afraid ? said d artagnan , coming back to recommend courage to his lackey .: 31.82
<S> he has followed us several times , as i think , when i have waited for my wife at the wicket of the louvre to escort her home . the commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness .: 35.36
<S> why , this evening , said the abbess ; today even .: 47.51
<S> will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishment for of all this i have the proofs ? she was my mother ! cried the young man , who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force .: 69.04
<S> withdraw him gently from the queen , whom he does not like , from mazarin , whom he despises .: 56.25
<S> a banker must , you know , be a slave to his promise . and danglars sighed as m. cavalcanti had done half an hour before .: 54.24
<S> madame de villefort emptied the contents into the ashes , which she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid ; then she carefully rinsed the glass , and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table .: 42.53
<S> do you know monsieur de tre ville , their captain ? oh , yes , him !: 19.62
<S> one has never the last word with such a man .: 48.43
<S> coquenard was not less affected by it on her part , for she added , my cousin will not return if he finds that we do not treat him kindly ; but otherwise he has so little time to pass in paris , and consequently to spare to us , that we must entreat him to give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure . oh , my legs , my poor legs !: 52.75
<S> quiet was at length restored .: 112.62
<S> i !: 24.10
<S> i don t know what devil of an insect stung me and made me ambitious .: 52.37
<S> more dead than alive , he looked around him .: 50.06
<S> monsieur the governor was all astonishment .: 62.77
<S> no ; but just think , there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as charlemagne , or at least to hugh capet .: 98.93
<S> m. de morcerf approached her .: 13.15
<S> finally , d artagnan had entire faith in the bravery of planchet , and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of boulogne .: 49.33
<S> the latter rose and bowed to the countess , who inclined herself without speaking .: 43.41
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> they quickly went downstairs .: 60.75
<S> bigamy , my dear !: 55.89
<S> how can i understand ?: 18.20
<S> oh , no , sir ; from my childhood i have seen too much , and understood too much , of what has passed around me , for misfortune to have an undue power over me .: 36.22
<S> if the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem .: 56.20
<S> for my part , i wash my hands of the affair . so saying , she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber , her body convulsed with chills , and her teeth rattling in her head , in spite of the intense heat of the weather .: 41.74
<S> we were then convinced , my friend and i , that there was some error of which we were the victims , and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves .: 52.84
<S> planchet addressed the officer with a fine flemish phrase ; the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all , and the bargain was concluded ; madeleine s brother entered d artagnan s service .: 134.79
<S> this small staff was quite equal to all the requirements , for a canal between beaucaire and aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach .: 130.22
<S> his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm , but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped .: 25.76
<S> madame de villefort remained immersed in thought .: 36.79
<S> great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen , and if talked about , the evil would only recoil upon us . ah , monsieur ! stammered planchet , more dead than alive , ah , monsieur , what an escape i have had ! how , sirrah !: 83.15
<S> it was then that he encountered for the first time villefort s look , that look peculiar to the magistrate , who , while seeming to read the thoughts of others , betrays nothing of his own .: 37.11
<S> i know you are accustomed to assassinate people ; but i warn you i shall defend myself , even against you . you are right , said milady .: 22.90
<S> then d artagnan became almost wild .: 45.20
<S> to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation ?: 72.25
<S> he has given you some little writing for me the least bit of paper which may show that you come in his name .: 66.28
<S> morrel threw a glance around , but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer , still unperceived .: 67.47
<S> let us return to your apartment .: 16.55
<S> she would , indeed , have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes , when suddenly madame danglars hand , pressed on her arm , aroused her from her lethargy .: 51.20
<S> see what they have done ! cried morrel , with one hand leaning on the back of the chair , and the other extended towards valentine .: 26.01
<S> d artagnan , seeing him approach , drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard .: 18.94
<S> maillard , began the curate , this gentleman and i have come to talk with you a little . with me ! said the mendicant ; it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water . there was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor .: 53.74
<S> his grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious .: 37.12
<S> the gascon uttered a furious imprecation , which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron panel .: 35.71
<S> when the name of colonel fairfax was called , one of those brief but solemn silences ensued , which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the trial .: 61.40
<S> a large round rock , placed solidly on its base , was the only spot to which they seemed to lead .: 41.90
<S> then he raised the flag stone cautiously with his head , and looked carefully around the chamber .: 35.15
<S> look at my eyes and you will see what no looking glass has ever shown you a frank and honorable countenance . to this flow of words , not perhaps in the best taste , but characteristic of d artagnan , whose principal object was to divert his opponent s attention , mordaunt did not reply , but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with d artagnan .: 81.00
<S> alas , it is not the death of the body i regret ; for is not the destruction of the vital principle , the repose to which everything is tending , to which every unhappy being aspires , is not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed , and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon ?: 98.67
<S> i believed him still at brussels . oh , sir , if you know who this man is , cried d artagnan , tell me who he is , and whence he is .: 26.49
<S> mon dieu !: 16.61
<S> yes , he murmured , yes , be satisfied . his head dropped upon his chest , and in this position he paced his study ; then he threw himself , dressed as he was , upon a sofa , less to sleep than to rest his limbs , cramped with cold and study .: 46.91
<S> the damp had rendered it friable , and dante s was able to break it off in small morsels , it is true , but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful ; a mathematician might have calculated that in two years , supposing that the rock was not encountered , a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad , might be formed .: 63.05
<S> what the devil did you come to such a country for , athos ?: 33.87
<S> you have told me yourself , madame , that i have been drawn into a snare ; i , perhaps , may leave my life in it for , although it may be strange , i have for some time had a presentiment that i should shortly die . and the duke smiled , with a smile at once sad and charming .: 37.20
<S> come , come , continued the count , i see you are still the same , an assassin . reverend sir , since you know everything , you know it was not i it was la carconte ; that was proved at the trial , since i was only condemned to the galleys . is your time , then , expired , since i find you in a fair way to return there ? no , reverend sir ; i have been liberated by someone . that someone has done society a great kindness . ah , said caderousse , i had promised and you are breaking your promise ! interrupted monte cristo .: 38.72
<S> at a league from beauvais , where the road was confined between two high banks , they fell in with eight or ten men who , taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot , appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with mud .: 80.76
<S> he entered by the faubourg st. jacques , under verdant arches .: 50.81
<S> on what plea ? you are right ; but you have made my mouth water .: 42.57
<S> our dear count ! said d artagnan .: 9.65
<S> oh , d artagnan ! the devil !: 11.57
<S> by heavens !: 43.85
<S> d artagnan , who had his eyes fixed upon this man , became very pale , and let his glass fall .: 18.50
<S> it was a strange thing , and one which made d artagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair , to find that this soft light , this calm lamp , enlightened a scene of fearful disorder .: 58.46
<S> do you understand the meaning of my words ?: 16.82
<S> the wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously .: 57.45
<S> there is here no question of crime or treason .: 65.91
<S> help ! cried the abbe , i i die i 0229m so sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence ; a violent convulsion shook his whole frame , his eyes started from their sockets , his mouth was drawn on one side , his cheeks became purple , he struggled , foamed , dashed himself about , and uttered the most dreadful cries , which , however , dante s prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket .: 66.04
<S> sir , said she , the language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt , and i can teach you in a few minutes , to understand it almost as well as i can myself .: 40.20
<S> he was young , he had an old father whom he loved , a betrothed bride whom he adored .: 41.09
<S> what could they desire beyond their liberty ?: 96.19
<S> i do not remember if it is exactly 48,000 francs , which i am still owing him , but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference .: 41.76
<S> monsieur de beaufort , in common with many other prisoners , was bent upon doing things that were prohibited ; and the only resource the governor had was , one day when the duke was playing at tennis , to efface all these drawings , consisting chiefly of profiles .: 82.22
<S> it seems to me that we once rendered anne of austria a service not much less than that which to day we are trying to perform for charles i. ; but , none the less , anne of austria has forgotten us for twenty years . well , in spite of that , d artagnan , said athos , you are not sorry that you were useful to her ? no , indeed , said d artagnan ; i admit even that in my darkest moments i find consolation in that remembrance . you see , then , d artagnan , though princes often are ungrateful , god never is . athos , said d artagnan , i believe that were you to fall in with the devil , you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to heaven . so , then ? said athos , offering his hand to d artagnan .: 35.36
<S> certainly .: 41.71
<S> i tell you what , my dear fellow , said cha teau renaud , i can not imagine what objection you can possibly have to mademoiselle danglars that is , setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank , which by the way i don t think you care very much about .: 55.13
<S> i have an extraordinary means which i will not employ but in the last extremity to close your mouth , or at least to prevent anyone from believing a word you may utter . i mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter .: 56.76
<S> anne of austria alone was permitted to enter by that door .: 23.88
<S> when this terrible chain of ideas presented itself , valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell , and call for help .: 62.96
<S> as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass .: 27.78
<S> as to monsieur , who had begun the siege , he left to the cardinal the task of finishing it .: 44.54
<S> yes , the enemy .: 28.43
<S> milady had guessed aright .: 37.76
<S> the sea was calm , and , with a fresh breeze from the south east , they sailed beneath a bright blue sky , in which god also lighted up in turn his beacon lights , each of which is a world .: 67.89
<S> gentlemen , he said , you will admit that , when arrived at a certain degree of fortune , the superfluities of life are all that can be desired ; and the ladies will allow that , after having risen to a certain eminence of position , the ideal alone can be more exalted .: 53.61
<S> is that what you wish for ? yes , replied the invalid .: 14.75
<S> i had been fifteen days without seeing a human face , and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles . that was no reason for staking my diamond ! replied d artagnan , closing his hand with a nervous spasm .: 46.23
<S> i do not seek your confidence , my dear friend .: 13.06
<S> the most profound terror reigned throughout the house .: 48.78
<S> me !: 92.43
<S> help !: 33.86
<S> the distance was short , and at the end of ten minutes his carriage , or rather the count s , stopped before the ho tel de londres .: 18.99
<S> you meddle with politics , do you and still more , with cardinalist politics ?: 89.57
<S> if you want anything you can ring . oh , my god , my god !: 23.38
<S> mute with horror , the three friends had remained open mouthed , their eyes dilated , their arms extended like statues , and , motionless as they were , the beating of their hearts was audible .: 59.15
<S> at length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had ; he owed three quarters rent , and they threatened to turn him out ; he begged for another week , which was granted to him .: 54.50
<S> you will tell me that i am a living being , and not a code a man , and not a volume .: 29.76
<S> no , it will all go well ; m. d e pinay , if he is an honorable man , will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort , unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice , but that is impossible . i agree with m. de villefort , said monte cristo , fixing his eyes on madame de villefort ; and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice , i would persuade him , since i have been told m. d e pinay is coming back , to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation .: 32.59
<S> nevertheless , they were still in a state of uncertainty .: 21.63
<S> halloo !: 28.51
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> the curtain rose , and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors ; and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage .: 55.53
<S> then offer him double that sum ; a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital . is your excellency really in earnest ? inquired the steward .: 107.22
<S> i believe the fellow is here on his own account , for i have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the tweed are very vindictive .: 57.15
<S> we have something very important to say to him . i understand , said athos ; but why not porthos ?: 23.10
<S> face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more easy .: 118.70
<S> during the days of his prosperity , not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators .: 100.08
<S> oh , what imprudence , my lord , said d artagnan ; tis not good to be about just here without a light .: 41.35
<S> never had anne of austria appeared to him so beautiful , amid balls , fe tes , or carousals , as she appeared to him at this moment , dressed in a simple robe of white satin , and accompanied by donna estafania the only one of her spanish women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the persecutions of richelieu .: 43.76
<S> i have an idea , which i will explain by and by , of making an exception to the usual form of accusation .: 70.00
<S> attention , porthos ! cried d artagnan .: 13.70
<S> to donate , please visit : www.gutenberg.org donate .: 22.78
<S> he was telling me this morning that , tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy , which is a dead nation , he wished to find a method , either in france or england , of multiplying his millions , but remember , that though i place great confidence in busoni , i am not responsible for this . never mind ; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me .: 91.52
<S> with some gentleman who was traveling this way , to whom he proposed a game of lansquenet . that s it , then , and the foolish fellow lost all he had ? even to his horse , monsieur ; for when the gentleman was about to set out , we perceived that his lackey was saddling monsieur porthos s horse , as well as his master s .: 47.57
<S> he found d artagnan waiting for him already at his post in the ante room .: 27.28
<S> at the first glance , and by the joy which was painted on his countenance , the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on foot .: 51.44
<S> at first he had been followed through astonishment , then with derisive shouts , then the porters had insulted him , then children had thrown stones at him , and finally he was obliged to run , to escape the missiles .: 60.62
<S> oh , nothing worth speaking of , said morrel ; m .: 40.54
<S> indeed , count , said madame danglars , i am ashamed to own it , but all your frightful stories have so upset me , that i must beg you to let me sit down ; and she fell into a chair .: 27.19
<S> they separated , and d artagnan rushed between them like a dart .: 32.25
<S> at this moment a soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for them .: 23.78
<S> and now , my dear friend , said faria , sole consolation of my wretched existence , you whom heaven gave me somewhat late , but still gave me , a priceless gift , and for which i am most grateful , at the moment of separating from you forever , i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve .: 56.24
<S> he and the count de guiche are like each other s shadows . thanks , planchet , thanks ! cried athos , extending his hand to the lieutenant .: 26.97
<S> at that time i was not concerned in the adventure , in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me !: 48.67
<S> the ballet of la merlaison on the morrow , nothing was talked of in paris but the ball which the aldermen of the city were to give to the king and queen , and in which their majesties were to dance the famous la merlaison the favorite ballet of the king .: 45.75
<S> the queen appeared cheerful and happy , which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of care .: 55.21
<S> they told him so frankly , and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy .: 43.96
<S> my lord , fronde is the name the discontented give to their party . and what is the origin of this name ? it seems that some days since councillor bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones from the moats round paris , young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears , only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned .: 163.99
<S> louvieres was proud and satisfied ; he had taken revenge on mazarin and had aided in his father s deliverance from prison .: 97.12
<S> what do you want ?: 6.40
<S> formerly a brewer , replied the gascon .: 33.06
<S> yes , before witnesses . oh , this is very interesting , said debray ; if there really has been a crime , we will investigate it . there has been a crime , said monte cristo .: 26.71
<S> this is the fourth which you have let fall and i have picked up ; for in three years , madame , i have only seen you four times the first , which i have described to you ; the second , at the mansion of madame de chevreuse ; the third , in the gardens of amiens . duke , said the queen , blushing , never speak of that evening . oh , let us speak of it ; on the contrary , let us speak of it !: 23.65
<S> believe me , the cord is more certain than the knife . felton grew pale , and made a step forward , remembering that at the moment he entered milady had a rope in her hand .: 38.96
<S> it is he ! exclaimed de winter , seizing the arm of athos ; it is he !: 13.49
<S> and still further , it is very probable i should not have done anything of this , if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady , as the queen is yours . yes , said the duke , smiling , and i even believe that i know that other person ; it is my lord , i have not named her ! interrupted the young man , warmly .: 30.29
<S> sir ! can you be a coward ? continued villefort , with increasing excitement , you , who could count , one by one , the minutes of four death agonies ?: 84.62
<S> speak , make haste . bind my arms , my lord , fast . why bind thee ? that i may not be considered as your accomplice . your hands ? asked grimaud .: 57.64
<S> the witnesses endeavored to insist , but the president bade them be silent .: 60.64
<S> i am very ignorant of these matters , said the abbess , at length ; but however distant from the court we may be , however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed , we have very sad examples of what you have related .: 48.04
<S> at this announcement , during which the door remained open , everyone became mute , and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber , and entered the apartment of the captain of the musketeers , congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel .: 43.86
<S> one might have supposed him thunderstruck ; a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin , but disappeared immediately .: 77.53
<S> my father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk .: 69.11
<S> he and she . the queen and the duke ? cried richelieu .: 48.22
<S> still , when morrel had finished , he shut his eyes several times , which was his manner of saying no . no ? said morrel ; you disapprove of this second project , as you did of the first ? i do , signified the old man .: 46.68
<S> d artagnan went out , but at the door his heart almost failed him , and he felt inclined to return .: 20.40
<S> corbleu !: 47.68
<S> i used to learn all these feat by heart yonder , down at pierrefonds , and i have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my temples . because your strength is not in your head , porthos , said his friend .: 70.05
<S> in the first place , i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search of . what proofs do you require ? did you , in the year 1814 or 1815 , know anything of a young sailor named dante s ? dante s ?: 33.92
<S> the antechamber of m. de tre ville chapter iii .: 12.23
<S> up to that time , whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it , this maxim , without being generally adopted , nevertheless passed from theory into practice ; but the notes did it injury .: 125.49
<S> you can not tell me ?: 16.17
<S> he started when he saw rene e , for he fancied she was again about to plead for dante s .: 36.04
<S> the enemy s army extended from cassel to courtray ; and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit , the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them .: 139.45
<S> yes , said grimaud .: 9.67
<S> on their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window to read eagerly the following letter : dear wife , we have now reached the moment of decision .: 91.95
<S> i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful , if not worse than useless .: 85.83
<S> at the door stood two horses , fresh , strong , and fully equipped .: 40.15
<S> one may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and husband .: 43.60
<S> are you going to marry mademoiselle danglars ? why do you ask me now ? because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking . how ? said albert , whose brow reddened ; you think m. danglars i ask you only how your engagement stands ?: 38.68
<S> i am fond of grass and shade , said monte cristo .: 22.54
<S> marshal de grammont was to hold the extreme left , resting on mericourt .: 155.42
<S> i made the tour of the room at least twenty times , in search of an outlet of some kind ; but there was none .: 43.31
<S> yes , if i am killed , said albert , laughing .: 13.14
<S> if we had only been looking for porthos , porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him .: 43.30
<S> it is , in truth , monsieur le coadjuteur s carriage , said d artagnan ; upon my honor i begin to think that heaven favors us . he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman s little finger .: 43.20
<S> in ten minutes it would strike seven .: 53.53
<S> we must see what it is , said grimaud .: 13.04
<S> had fernand really meant to kill himself , he would have done so when he parted from merce de s .: 46.77
<S> you know how little i require , said the old man .: 16.91
<S> the races , like the moccoli , are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival .: 38.74
<S> albert ran to fetch a carriage .: 32.34
<S> he knows her brother in law .: 17.51
<S> he uttered not a word , nor shed a tear , but a deadly pallor spread over his face ; he knelt down on the ground , raised winter s head , and unfastening the order of the saint esprit , placed it on his own breast .: 36.68
<S> you know i always did call you my child . come , come , what then ? patience patience ! i am patient , but go on . all at once i see you pass through the barrier with a groom , a tilbury , and fine new clothes .: 56.97
<S> this might be a kind remembrance of monsieur the cardinal .: 39.68
<S> rochefort , all is not lost ; and perhaps perhaps everything is for the best . the fact is that i do not doubt your eminence s genius will repair the blunders of his agent is that it ? that is exactly what i was going to say , if your eminence had let me finish my sentence . meanwhile , do you know where the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham are now concealed ? no , monseigneur ; my people could tell me nothing on that head . but i know . you , monseigneur ? yes ; or at least i guess .: 42.47
<S> while he had been absorbed in thought , they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail ; the boat was now moving with the wind .: 47.04
<S> but that is not a man s name ; that is the name of a mountain , cried the poor questioner , who began to lose his head .: 19.24
<S> it is of an original color , said aramis ; i never saw one with such a hide in my life . i can well believe it , replied d artagnan , and that was why i got three crowns for him .: 31.46
<S> ignorant of their real enemies , they do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks french badly , but those who can say fine things to them in the purest parisian accent , who are their real foes .: 77.03
<S> porthos and aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play .: 15.77
<S> made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow ; the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation , and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground .: 103.97
<S> you have seven martlets on your arms ; give three to your wife , and you will still have four ; that is one more than m. de guise had , who so nearly became king of france , and whose cousin was emperor of germany . on my word , i think you are right , lucien , said albert absently .: 58.12
<S> at half past six the duke arose and said very gravely : certainly , caesar was the greatest man of ancient times . you think so , my lord ? answered la ramee .: 51.93
<S> i thank you for having recognized me , sir . debray stepped forward , and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor .: 36.97
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea , commanded by the terrace where he was .: 36.66
<S> in a creek lay a little sloop , with a narrow keel and high masts , bearing on its flag the monte cristo arms which were a mountain or , on a sea azure , with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled calvary , the mount rendered by our lord s passion more precious than gold , and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy ; or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personage s past life .: 108.09
<S> now you are rich , said monte cristo .: 9.13
<S> if no obstacle occurs we will both charge together , force the enemy s line and throw ourselves into the tyne , which we must cross , either by fording or swimming ; if , on the contrary , any repulse should take place , you and your men must fight to the last man , whilst we and the king proceed on our road .: 82.68
<S> these would just have suited them .: 138.21
<S> oh , sir said she , clasping her hands .: 16.84
<S> go on . it was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter , and , as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road , i resolved not to break through the rule , so climbing over the garden hedge , i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees , and fearing that caderousse might have some guest , i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the night , and which was only separated from the inn by a partition , in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence .: 67.43
<S> he knows all !: 41.81
<S> well , what is the matter , my dear ? asked the gentleman whose name the lady s agitation revealed ; tell me what is the matter . oh , lucien , can i confide in you ? of course , you know you can do so .: 29.13
<S> i suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket ? yes , madame ; i have that of the garter , which king charles i. gave me some days before he died . come , i am growing an old woman ! said the duchess , pensively .: 30.77
<S> on each side of the choir and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole community of the carmelites , who listened to the divine service , and mingled their chant with the chant of the priests , without seeing the profane , or being seen by them .: 62.86
<S> you are mistaken ; it is olivain who leaves me ; you are to remain . on the contrary , olivain is to stay and i am to go .: 32.66
<S> the balls passed and whistled all around him ; not one struck him .: 82.60
<S> in fact , the blow was direct and severe .: 29.07
<S> how is it that i have never met you at his house ? i am no acquaintance of m. de villefort s , answered morrel , but i was of madame de saint me ran . albert came up to them at this moment with franz .: 20.09
<S> what my maid tells me . but what does she tell you ? that when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage , he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge .: 51.06
<S> ah ! he muttered to himself , this changes the situation , and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show mazarin that we are still , thank god , good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner ; and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five and twenty .: 50.64
<S> if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time , count , instead of only for the second , said madame de villefort ; if i had had the honor of being your friend , instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you , i should insist on detaining you to dinner , and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal . a thousand thanks , madame , replied monte cristo but i have an engagement which i can not break .: 33.76
<S> horrible ! replied raoul , especially in expression . yes , yes , said de guiche , a strange face ; but these monks are subject to such degrading practices ; their fasts make them pale , the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites , and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy , but they have lost . well , said raoul , the poor man will get his priest , but , by heaven , the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor .: 90.63
<S> the baron took the pen and signed , then the representative .: 35.47
<S> then caderousse , feeling that he was leaving him , raised himself on his elbow , and with a dying voice cried with great effort : murder !: 43.90
<S> these gentlemen , added he , turning to the two friends , will , i trust , do me the honor to breakfast with me ? but , my dear count , said albert , we shall abuse your kindness . not at all ; on the contrary , you will give me great pleasure .: 19.30
<S> eh , give it to me ! said the young man .: 10.48
<S> every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the bastile , instead of vincennes .: 84.77
<S> this is what has happened : my brother , who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary , met with the emissary of the cardinal , who was coming in search of me .: 30.33
<S> so much the worse for thee , for harm may come of it ! meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction .: 61.79
<S> you are then in possession of 900,000 francs ? asked the notary .: 16.97
<S> besides , it doesn t concern me ; it relates to mademoiselle marie michon . ah , that is true , said athos .: 19.93
<S> p.s . according to the desire of your eminence , i report to the convent of the carmelites at be thune , where i will await your orders . accordingly , that same evening milady commenced her journey .: 56.84
<S> then d artagnan , who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel , endeavored to turn the conversation ; but he could not succeed .: 31.04
<S> athos started , passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration that burst forth , and rose in his turn with a nervous movement he could not repress .: 39.66
<S> athos took his son s horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee .: 36.29
<S> bonacieux had not been abed .: 34.45
<S> this gloomy fortress , which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends , seemed to dante s like a scaffold to a malefactor .: 78.70
<S> oh , he never was a friend of mine , i did not know him , and i had nothing to ask of him . do you not know what became of him , and the share he had in edmond s misfortunes ? no ; i only know that some time after edmond s arrest , he married mademoiselle de saint me ran , and soon after left marseilles ; no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest ; no doubt he is as rich as danglars , as high in station as fernand .: 35.64
<S> he pretends the air of the faubourg saint honore is not good for me . indeed ? said morrel ; in that m. noirtier may be right ; you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight . not very , said valentine .: 46.55
<S> ah , it is no , then ? yes . valentine fetched a dictionary , which she placed on a desk before noirtier ; she opened it , and , seeing that the old man s eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages , she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns .: 30.41
<S> listen , milady , said the cardinal , the affair is important .: 23.28
<S> i have only two adversaries i will not say two conquerors , for with perseverance i subdue even them , they are time and distance .: 89.32
<S> as a skillful general , seeing the enemy ready to surrender , marches toward him with a cry of victory , she rose , beautiful as an antique priestess , inspired like a christian virgin , her arms extended , her throat uncovered , her hair disheveled , holding with one hand her robe modestly drawn over her breast , her look illumined by that fire which had already created such disorder in the veins of the young puritan , and went toward him , crying out with a vehement air , and in her melodious voice , to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy : let this victim to baal be sent , to the lions the martyr be thrown !: 84.73
<S> the victory was complete ; twice he had overcome his doubts .: 73.81
<S> what are you going to do ? asked the wounded man .: 5.44
<S> athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow .: 21.39
<S> there was no time to lose .: 9.66
<S> noirtier made a sign that it did .: 26.51
<S> merce de s is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in paris , replied caderousse .: 19.09
<S> besides , nobody came thither but the three musketeers ; they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries , but had discovered nothing .: 86.35
<S> noirtier , playing with revolutions m .: 160.20
<S> nothing can be said ; let us be off , gentlemen , let us be off ! grimaud was already ahead , with the basket and the dessert .: 30.49
<S> hem ! said the king .: 15.90
<S> about this time the nurse s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand .: 24.91
<S> at one end was the receipted bill for the 287,000 francs , and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazel nut , with these words on a small slip of parchment : julie s dowry .: 77.49
<S> now , you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity . or of wisdom , my dear baron or of wisdom , said louis xviii. , laughing ; the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the ocean see plutarch s life of scipio africanus . m. de blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister .: 111.49
<S> is the king of the spaniards , never had a penny in his pocket . go on , sir , i see what you wish to get at ; and if it is simply what i think that stops you , i can obviate the difficulty . ah , i knew well , said the gascon , that you were a man of talent .: 29.92
<S> much obliged to you , monsieur dulaurier .: 67.48
<S> let him be conquered , exiled , proscribed , provided he still lives .: 81.27
<S> leaving the village of linas , without stopping at the telegraph , which flourished its great bony arms as he passed , the count reached the tower of montlhe ry , situated , as everyone knows , upon the highest point of the plain of that name .: 58.85
<S> well , monseigneur , replied the latter , three musketeers and a guardsman laid a wager with monsieur de busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion st. gervais ; and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy , and have killed i don t know how many rochellais . did you inquire the names of those three musketeers ? yes , monseigneur . what are their names ? messieurs athos , porthos , and aramis . still my three brave fellows ! murmured the cardinal .: 40.41
<S> i have even informed him of a circumstance i consider very serious ; the young man was either charmed by his nurse , stolen by gypsies , or lost by his tutor , i scarcely know which .: 85.55
<S> this person , a sailor , of turbulent character , and whom i suspected of bonapartism , has been secretly to the island of elba .: 34.45
<S> perfectly safe and sound , my good host ; and i wish to know what has become of our young man . he is better , said the host , he fainted quite away . indeed ! said the gentleman .: 37.90
<S> his drawing room , under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage , scarcely eighteen , was still one of the well regulated paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained .: 101.17
<S> do not fear ; pardieu ! we are alone . i think i have discovered my father . your true father ? yes . not old cavalcanti ? no , for he has gone again ; the true one , as you say . and that father is well , caderousse , it is monte cristo . bah ! yes , you understand , that explains all .: 41.11
<S> yes , repeated the count .: 8.06
<S> poor assunta had guessed all .: 85.27
<S> as for me , i feel anxious to preach a sermon , said d artagnan .: 17.79
<S> i am hungry , that is all . pardieu , if that is all , i am hungry , too ; but it is not everything to be hungry , one must find something to eat , unless we browse on the grass , like our horses ah ! exclaimed aramis , who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of the earth as athos , do you remember , when we were at parpaillot , the beautiful oysters that we ate ? and the legs of mutton of the salt marshes , said porthos , smacking his lips .: 55.52
<S> now let us go . 50205m these words had scarcely escaped him , when the carriage was on its way , and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement .: 32.38
<S> valentine , whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her , was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen , with bright chestnut hair , deep blue eyes , and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother .: 61.13
<S> project gutenberg ebooks may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically anything in the united states with ebooks not protected by u.s. copyright law .: 14.26
<S> valentine opened her eyes .: 14.56
<S> nor i , said athos .: 22.00
<S> an island situated on the other side of the equator , at least two thousand leagues from here , replied the count .: 31.94
<S> bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of be thune with milady , her mortal enemy .: 100.18
<S> great god ! cried d artagnan , loosing his hold of her dress , and remaining mute , motionless , and frozen .: 28.61
<S> i don t know what it was .: 8.78
<S> all were still .: 61.07
<S> night had closed in , and paris , seen thus , by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water , crowded with ferry boats of every kind , including those that glittered with the armed patrols , with the watchword , passing from post to post paris presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of aramis , a man most susceptible to warlike impressions .: 127.09
<S> he opened his eyes upon utter darkness .: 23.07
<S> the room of the retired baker the evening of the day on which the count of morcerf had left danglars house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance , m. andrea cavalcanti , with curled hair , moustaches in perfect order , and white gloves which fitted admirably , had entered the courtyard of the banker s house in rue de la chausse e d antin .: 48.46
<S> the duke approached the altar , knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix , and opened the casket .: 58.29
<S> but de winter did not call ; crushed , enfeebled , he remained standing and with listening ear ; then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair , saying : my god , i thank thee that he knows me only . chapter xli .: 51.70
<S> morrel , farewell ! do you leave me ? yes ; i have business in italy .: 26.52
<S> milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life ; she resolved , then , to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward .: 80.92
<S> go to !: 44.80
<S> one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailor back to his recollection , and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors ; and pastrini s account of vampa s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen , reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht , which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them .: 96.28
<S> bonacieux in the convent of the carmelites at be thune , the trial in the isolated house , and the execution on the banks of the lys .: 33.68
<S> they had passed the te te de mort , were now off the anse du pharo , and about to double the battery .: 79.43
<S> how have you spent this 250,000 francs ? it is no business of mine . when are you coming to the point ? cried the baroness , shivering with anger and impatience .: 28.70
<S> the result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind .: 41.57
<S> bazin was then at the height of joy .: 38.59
<S> then it seems i am to eat alone , remarked the jeweller .: 37.37
<S> the papers said something about it , did they not ? then you believe the papers ? i ? not the least in the world ; only i fancied that the honest messager was an exception to the rule , and that it only announced telegraphic despatches . well , that s what puzzles me , replied danglars ; the news of the return of don carlos was brought by telegraph . so that , said monte cristo , you have lost nearly 1,700,000 francs this month . not nearly , indeed ; that is exactly my loss . diable ! said monte cristo compassionately , it is a hard blow for a third rate fortune . third rate , said danglars , rather humble , what do you mean by that ? certainly , continued monte cristo , i make three assortments in fortune first rate , second rate , and third rate fortunes .: 45.59
<S> well , said rene e , i can not help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own a physician , for instance .: 41.35
<S> here , my lord , here , said she , keep this in memory of me . buckingham took the casket , and fell a second time on his knees .: 32.15
<S> through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the park .: 71.61
<S> oh , my god , my god ! and she rose , with her hair dishevelled , and her lips foaming .: 11.84
<S> i do not know you . i am , said i , the little abbe who reads lives of the saints , and translates judith into verse . ah , ah !: 46.85
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> i have one , the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london ; but since you tell me to whom it is addressed , tis useless to wait till then . d artagnan tore open the envelope of the letter .: 45.42
<S> i don t think he put the faucet in again .: 38.33
<S> now , i entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head , it seems to suit my shoulders so correctly .: 85.10
<S> at the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside ; a cavalier , richly dressed , was close to the door .: 22.55
<S> oh , my lord , he cried , with an expression of stupefaction in his face ; you haven t the heart to kill me ! no ; not if thou dost not oppose my flight . but , my lord , if i allow you to escape i am a ruined man . i will compensate thee for the loss of thy place . you are determined to leave the chateau ? by heaven and earth !: 32.02
<S> but , as we have said , d artagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor kitty .: 21.96
<S> the cardinal put it on in military style .: 59.18
<S> hayde e , would it please you not to leave me ? i am young , gently replied hayde e ; i love the life you have made so sweet to me , and i should be sorry to die . you mean , then , that if i leave you , hayde e i should die ; yes , my lord . do you then love me ? oh , valentine , he asks if i love him .: 24.42
<S> her grief , which she had hitherto tried to restrain , now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing .: 74.11
<S> d artagnan ground his teeth .: 31.71
<S> well , if he does not come , it will be because he has been delayed , that s all .: 18.84
<S> it was not difficult to conquer , as she had hitherto done , men prompt to let themselves be seduced , and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net .: 80.99
<S> i only request you to give me one by which i may have the pleasure of addressing you .: 24.87
<S> the count hastily descended , presented himself at the already opened carriage door , and held out his hand to a young woman , completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold .: 47.91
<S> louis xiii .: 12.19
<S> three months passed and still she wept no news of edmond , no news of fernand , no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair .: 75.99
<S> your feet , too , said grimaud .: 20.50
<S> ideology chapter 49 .: 85.07
<S> have you answered the question i put to you on entering the room ? where do you keep the poison you generally use , madame ? madame de villefort raised her arms to heaven , and convulsively struck one hand against the other .: 36.02
<S> this is what had happened : andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two thirds of the chimney , but then his foot slipped , and notwithstanding his endeavors , he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended .: 57.60
<S> just now , d artagnan continued , you were disguised i mean to say , attired as a murderer , and now and now i look very much like a man who is going to be murdered . oh !: 33.88
<S> m. bonacieux was at his door .: 15.55
<S> i am completely ignorant ; nor does it much disquiet me . you re in the wrong there ; for if you knew my name , perhaps you would not be so pressing . what is your name ? bernajoux , at your service . well , then , monsieur bernajoux , said d artagnan , tranquilly , i will wait for you at the door . go , monsieur , i will follow you . do not hurry yourself , monsieur , lest it be observed that we go out together .: 30.16
<S> i like to hear him talk , said athos ; his dialect amuses me . gentlemen , cried aramis , listen to this . listen to aramis , said his three friends .: 33.98
<S> her white and slender fingers , her pearly neck , her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan .: 97.74
<S> no pity for him who had no pity !: 60.18
<S> are you ready , sir ? he said at last .: 12.18
<S> my dear mistress turquaine , said the gascon , if you happen to have any money , lock it up quickly ; if you happen to have any jewels , hide them directly ; if you happen to have any debtors , make them pay you , or any creditors , don t pay them . why , prithee ? asked madeleine .: 60.26
<S> in exchange for all this , he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen ; but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution , and her protection , as it was known , protected badly as witness chalais and mme .: 77.24
<S> you need , as much as we do , that interior condition of repose which , thanks to the energy of our government , we are about to attain .: 37.51
<S> and the man opposite to you is the man i saw go in . do you know him ? i thought i recognized him , and was not mistaken .: 32.69
<S> let me die ; that is all .: 14.41
<S> you have a quick ear , monsieur athos , said the cardinal ; but now listen to this .: 22.47
<S> porthos , i doubt if you can wear it ; but should it be too tight , never mind , you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red feathers . it happened , however , that the second soldier was a swiss of gigantic proportions , so , save that some few of the seams split , his uniform fitted porthos perfectly .: 80.52
<S> but here is the letter . very well , said the prince ; give it to me later .: 17.47
<S> as the steward had said , the notary awaited him in the small salon .: 30.27
<S> monsieur is , i am sure , an honest man . take away that fool ! said the cardinal .: 30.45
<S> i shall , replied d artagnan , and instantly . in truth , my young friend , you will act rightly , said the gentleman , pressing the gascon s hand with an affection almost paternal ; and god grant that this woman , who has scarcely entered into your life , may not leave a terrible trace in it ! and athos bowed to d artagnan like a man who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone with his thoughts .: 39.72
<S> that french officer yes . fernand ? yes . the traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was pardon me , my friend , that man was your father ! albert advanced furiously towards beauchamp , but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand .: 78.98
<S> this evening , said the governor .: 14.30
<S> i love her ; and i ask god and you how i can save her ? monte cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion .: 65.00
<S> i believe that i alone , of all my countrymen , survived that dreadful war .: 78.76
<S> go on aramis , go on . all at once , a tall , dark gentleman just like yours , d artagnan . the same , perhaps , said he .: 28.99
<S> ah , said louise , breathing freely , here we are out of paris . yes , my dear , the abduction is an accomplished fact , replied euge nie .: 33.04
<S> captivity : the fourth day the next day , when felton entered milady s apartment he found her standing , mounted upon a chair , holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs , twisted into a kind of rope one with another , and tied at the ends .: 61.50
<S> he crept from his hole and stood , hidden by the black drapery , beneath the scaffold .: 55.13
<S> this young man terrifies me , my lord ; there lies in him a sanguinary predisposition . what occupies him in england ? he is one of cromwell s most enthusiastic disciples . but what attached him to the cause ?: 62.44
<S> the groom , in obedience to his orders , tapped at the window of the porter s lodge , saying : pray , does not the count of monte cristo live here ? his excellency does reside here , replied the concierge ; but added he , glancing an inquiring look at ali .: 41.37
<S> but it has not been so with me , i see , and always have seen , during the last sixteen years .: 28.69
<S> then ali brought on the dessert , or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table .: 35.36
<S> do you regret them ? asked morrel , with his open laugh .: 21.60
<S> i was deceived , as it appears , and i ask your pardon . and what did monsieur d artagnan reply ? monsieur d artagnan promised me his assistance ; but i soon found out that he was betraying me . you impose upon justice .: 37.02
<S> but if they say , it must be to me , am i no longer king ? the queen remained silent .: 35.06
<S> well , decapitator , guardian of the state , royalist , brutus , what is the matter ? said one .: 43.97
<S> in the capture of a king , his degradation and his murder . oh !: 52.71
<S> you would love me as much if i were poor , would you not , maximilian ? oh , i shall always love you .: 24.04
<S> and when the jeweller johannes had just paid you 45,000 francs for the diamond i had given you , and you killed him to get the diamond and the money both , was that also poverty ? pardon , reverend sir , said caderousse ; you have saved my life once , save me again ! that is but poor encouragement . are you alone , reverend sir , or have you there soldiers ready to seize me ? i am alone , said the abbe , and i will again have pity on you , and will let you escape , at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to , if you tell me the truth . ah , reverend sir , cried caderousse , clasping his hands , and drawing nearer to monte cristo , i may indeed say you are my deliverer ! you mean to say you have been freed from confinement ? yes , that is true , reverend sir . who was your liberator ? an englishman . what was his name ? lord wilmore . i know him ; i shall know if you lie . ah , reverend sir , i tell you the simple truth . was this englishman protecting you ? no , not me , but a young corsican , my companion . what was this young corsican s name ? benedetto . is that his christian name ? he had no other ; he was a foundling . then this young man escaped with you ? he did . in what way ? we were working at saint mandrier , near toulon .: 43.50
<S> i have just killed a man whose face is not unknown to me .: 23.45
<S> to you , as the king s attorney , i denounce mademoiselle de villefort , do your duty . doctor , i resist no longer i can no longer defend myself i believe you ; but , for pity s sake , spare my life , my honor ! m .: 38.91
<S> he desired him also , should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon , to fetch him , taking on himself the payment of the messenger .: 87.48
<S> i feared it , maximilian , said she ; it is the counsel of a madman , and i should be more mad than you , did i not stop you at once with the word impossible , morrel , impossible ! you will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it ? said morrel sorrowfully .: 44.90
<S> planchet proceeded toward the rue du colombier , and d artagnan toward the rue fe rou .: 14.62
<S> the prince , who had a great repugnance to treat with such an ill bred fellow , made out a list , against the grain , and sent it .: 44.68
<S> another way of getting hanged . so you refuse my request ? to be sure i do furiously ! the pretty landlady was desolate .: 75.39
<S> the nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door .: 42.85
<S> all the spectators returned him his salute , accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four ; after which all four disappeared in the bastion , whither grimaud had preceded them .: 113.34
<S> the clock of the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs e lyse es , and made monte cristo raise his head .: 28.80
<S> broussel had been conducted out of paris without further resistance , and was at this time in the prison of saint germain ; while blancmesnil , who was arrested at the same time , but whose arrest had been made without difficulty or noise , was safe in the castle of vincennes .: 40.23
<S> the second contained the duke and duchess of orleans , the tall young mademoiselle and the abbe de la riviere ; and the third , the duke de longueville and the prince de conti , brother and brother in law of conde .: 25.55
<S> three , replied aramis , smiling .: 24.47
<S> by its light , between the island of lemaire and cape croiselle , a quarter of a league distant , dante s saw a fishing boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves .: 63.76
<S> ah , indeed ? said d avrigny , struck with a sudden thought , has it occurred to you noirtier did not let him finish .: 39.82
<S> he went to him .: 10.34
<S> the lackey bowed and let them pass .: 35.17
<S> this letter is not in your table nor in your secretary ; and yet this letter must be somewhere . would you dare to lift your hand to your queen ? said anne of austria , drawing herself up to her full height , and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening .: 42.91
<S> there s the article of remunerations and indemnifications to be discussed and set to rights . chancellor , said the queen , turning to seguier , our old acquaintance , you will open the conferences .: 52.49
<S> the count went out first , then albert .: 31.14
<S> five minutes after the door keeper again appeared ; all eyes were fixed on the door , and i , said beauchamp , shared the general expectation and anxiety .: 45.20
<S> the musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor .: 109.18
<S> we say the gravel he trod under his feet , for d artagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin .: 70.61
<S> thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors , seated on a rock , or undulating in the vessel , one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses .: 98.82
<S> five minutes after , andrea left the hotel , completely disguised , took a cabriolet , and ordered the driver to take him to the cheval rouge , at picpus .: 37.95
<S> the baron has just related a frightful story to me . milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim , and shook her head .: 41.30
<S> do you wish these proofs , these attestations , which i alone possess , to be destroyed ?: 53.55
<S> swear , my son . the child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said , i swear to your majesty . henry , said charles , call me your father . father , replied the child , i swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me king . good , my child .: 36.92
<S> i must at least have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty bottles . mercy ! cried the host , if the lackey has drunk only half as much as the master , i am a ruined man . grimaud is a well bred lackey .: 48.02
<S> how much have we , louise ? the young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid secretaire a small portfolio with a lock , in which she counted twenty three bank notes .: 54.08
<S> then they knelt on each side of the grave , and said the prayers of the dead .: 26.75
<S> you told me yourself that that ring that ring i have !: 67.66
<S> look at me , madame at me , whom you accuse of speaking loud and threateningly .: 65.70
<S> fortunately , for me , the handwriting was disguised . then you were aware of dante s being engaged in a conspiracy ? not i .: 58.20
<S> but d artagnan is devoid of such weaknesses .: 40.52
<S> one can say anything to me .: 42.02
<S> he heard hasty steps , the creaking of a door , people going and coming , and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered , saying : here is the brazier , lighted . there was a moment s silence , and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh , of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dante s was listening in horror .: 67.42
<S> a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity , once a scene of terror .: 65.85
<S> i had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes , and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts .: 216.38
<S> from the queen , replied the servant .: 23.60
<S> patience ! said athos ; i had a plan .: 27.42
<S> let go and clue up ! at this last command all the sails were lowered , and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards .: 114.93
<S> now , where are you going ? to brussels , if you like ; it is the nearest frontier .: 23.16
<S> and this is the reason , monsieur , continued maximilian , of my sister and brother in law having only 25,000 francs a year . maximilian had scarcely finished his story , during which the count s heart had swelled within him , when emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat .: 37.80
<S> i could kill an ox with a blow of my fist . well , then , family affairs , perhaps ? family !: 50.03
<S> it was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so much ; you gave him three sword wounds in three separate engagements . but you know he is now our friend ? no , i didn t know that .: 46.81
<S> now , jump down , athos . athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall .: 21.21
<S> the guide carried away the torch .: 55.72
<S> why , i did not expect to see you before tomorrow . my dear albert , replied franz , i am glad of this opportunity to tell you , once and forever , that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women .: 39.62
<S> the general s carriage was ready , but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it , since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went .: 49.99
<S> as for you , morrel , this is the secret of my conduct towards you .: 20.21
<S> behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps .: 65.26
<S> officer chapter lii .: 171.12
<S> the road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient appian way , and bordered with tombs .: 117.84
<S> oh ! said d artagnan , we don t now make war as we did formerly .: 35.25
<S> to enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife .: 38.70
<S> i think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs , and he appears likely to succeed .: 60.53
<S> two methods of self destruction were at his disposal .: 79.78
<S> however , he would not leave without the promise of seeing valentine again the next night .: 36.13
<S> the greatest possible gayety prevailed at court .: 106.67
<S> and i m one of the king s musketeers .: 21.05
<S> this precipitation this unusual appointment .: 139.76
<S> you , edmond , on the contrary , you are still young , handsome , dignified ; it is because you have had faith ; because you have had strength , because you have had trust in god , and god has sustained you .: 36.45
<S> let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk , and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree , without having the power , any more than the wish , to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung . bravo , villefort ! cried the marquis ; excellently well said !: 115.15
<S> this time we were the vultures ; so we opened the bird , and this time all special symptoms had disappeared , there were only general symptoms .: 68.21
<S> ah , monsieur , he was no longer a man , he was a devil !: 15.78
<S> there were not lacking , however , evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent , careless life of an only son , and who lives as it were in a gilded cage .: 77.87
<S> if you will give at each of these relays your address in paris , the four horses will follow you thither .: 55.76
<S> where are we going ? inquired aramis ; are we going to fight , perchance ?: 21.94
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> i wager anything , said albert , interrupting her , that i know what you were about to say . well , what is it ? if i guess rightly , will you confess it ? yes . on your honor ? on my honor . you were going to ask me if the count of monte cristo had arrived , or was expected . not at all .: 25.86
<S> from whom is this ? said he eagerly .: 24.19
<S> well , your majesty , said he , you see how far my enemies go ; they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me .: 42.93
<S> don t you see , my brave felton ; don t you see what i told you ?: 25.11
<S> however , as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever , mordaunt s foot at last touched the wall , against which he rested his left hand .: 56.16
<S> richelieu counted on his fingers , and said to himself , she will arrive , she says , four or five days after having received the money .: 34.51
<S> but neither in the street he had passed through , nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded , could he see anyone ; however slowly the stranger had walked , he was gone on his way , or perhaps had entered some house .: 87.64
<S> their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conjectures .: 158.31
<S> now , if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his abode , he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs , and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps , they would not be able to conceive what all this meant .: 40.28
<S> it is probable that the succor of the english fleet will never even arrive in sight of the place .: 28.55
<S> of the interval passed , nothing remains in the memory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of trees , mountains , and landscapes are lost .: 121.20
<S> the true difficulty of being admitted was not to be found at the first door , and even the second was passed easily enough ; but at the third watched , besides the guard and the doorkeepers , the faithful bernouin , a cerberus whom no speech could soften , no wand , even of gold , could charm .: 91.87
<S> the young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it .: 33.54
<S> if any harm come of it , it should fall on the guilty person ; and that , you know , is fernand .: 45.37
<S> signor pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow ; and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied .: 67.36
<S> mazarin looked at her , and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts , he read her thoughts in her countenance , as one sees in a transparent lake clouds pass reflections , like thoughts , of the heavens .: 92.25
<S> she opened her eyes , and saw the abbess , accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion , who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity .: 23.58
<S> oh , yes ; i can see it all before me this moment . was it not his betrothal feast ? it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending ; a police commissary , followed by four soldiers , entered , and dante s was arrested . yes , and up to this point i know all , said the priest .: 52.83
<S> who are you , sir , he asked , that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death ?: 36.36
<S> next day m. morrel seemed as calm as ever , went into his office as usual , came to his breakfast punctually , and then , after dinner , he placed his daughter beside him , took her head in his arms , and held her for a long time against his bosom .: 36.69
<S> beauchamp pulled out his watch .: 37.45
<S> god , he murmured , not knowing what he said , god god ! behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of god .: 54.13
<S> eh , gentlemen , let us reckon upon accidents !: 57.63
<S> you ask that ? put your two hands together .: 58.57
<S> you will appear at this ball ? yes . with those studs ? yes . the queen s paleness , if possible , increased ; the king perceived it , and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his character .: 53.51
<S> c s ... ar spada . well , do you comprehend now ? inquired faria .: 81.39
<S> once in paris , i shall prosecute my search for that unfortunate woman ! well , you may be assured that your horse will not be half so serviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis .: 81.46
<S> this was a sort of boudoir , circular , and lighted only from the roof , which consisted of rose colored glass .: 41.57
<S> for she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man , that dear marie ; i know only one other woman who can do it as well .: 85.04
<S> restore my brother to peace and happiness , whispered julie to monte cristo .: 75.07
<S> it is useless ; for i swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years , ago you , athos , in the rue ferou , and you , aramis , in the rue de vaugirard . stop , cried athos , extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted ; you will soon know what to expect , for here he is . who ? mordaunt . in fact , looking at the place to which athos pointed , d artagnan saw a cavalier coming toward the house at full gallop .: 30.95
<S> mazarin , who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry long live mazarin , and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each , kept one eye on porthos ; but that gigantic body guard replied to the look with his great bass voice , be tranquil , my lord , and mazarin became more and more composed .: 156.49
<S> assassin of buckingham , assassin of felton , assassin of my brother , i demand justice upon you , and i swear that if it be not granted to me , i will execute it myself . and lord de winter ranged himself by the side of d artagnan , leaving the place free for another accuser .: 44.03
<S> this cursed rolling ! said blaisois .: 44.32
<S> besides even you didn t recognize me ; they will be much less likely to . that is true , said mordaunt , and they will be far from thinking of you .: 36.56
<S> oh , am i happy enough for that ? yes ; you have called hayde e your sister , let her become so indeed , valentine ; render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me ; protect her , for the count s voice was thick with emotion henceforth she will be alone in the world . alone in the world ! repeated a voice behind the count , and why ? monte cristo turned around ; hayde e was standing pale , motionless , looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement .: 47.15
<S> two held poor assunta , who , unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her , smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners .: 54.06
<S> have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming ? ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair greek , which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance , that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence .: 84.72
<S> i willingly submit to any punishment your eminence may please to inflict upon me .: 109.60
<S> he knew , that i should arrive today at ten o clock ; he was waiting for me at nine at the barrie re de fontainebleau .: 32.03
<S> look at your brother monarch , charles i .: 144.76
<S> this is all very strange , said m. de tre ville , after meditating a minute ; you mentioned my name , then , aloud ? yes , sir , i certainly committed that imprudence ; but why should i have done otherwise ?: 34.79
<S> you might have taken lord winter who , tis said , was your uncle prisoner , but you preferred killing him ; tis well ; we , that is , monsieur du vallon and i , could have killed our prisoners we preferred taking them . mordaunt s very lips grew white with rage .: 101.34
<S> i shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged .: 45.89
<S> you may , perhaps , have hidden a thought ; but not a step , not an action , not a fault , has escaped me , while you flattered yourself upon your address , and firmly believed you had deceived me .: 49.28
<S> d artagnan , believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape , drew a pistol from his belt ; but athos raised his hand .: 44.78
<S> although the young man was brave , as we know , he was terrified at that wild countenance , those terribly dilated pupils , those pale cheeks , and those bleeding lips .: 82.79
<S> alas ! he said to himself , if i only had for a confessor one of those lights of the church , whose soul has sounded all the mysteries of life , all the littlenesses of greatness , perhaps his utterance would overawe the voice that wails within my soul .: 63.55
<S> pardon me , said d artagnan .: 6.37
<S> all the crowd gave way before morrel .: 53.08
<S> vampa , when this man is satisfied , let him be free . danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew ; when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow , before which the bandits bowed .: 68.85
<S> but how can that be ?: 20.51
<S> what ! someone is talking in the street . it is the voice of of my husband !: 42.13
<S> justice is done , said porthos , wiping his forehead .: 23.90
<S> oh , the wretched hours i have endured the torture to which i have submitted when i saw the deadly poison poured into your glass , and how i trembled lest you should drink it before i could find time to throw it away ! sir , said valentine , at the height of her terror , you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass ; but if you saw this , you must also have seen the person who poured it ? yes . valentine raised herself in bed , and drew over her chest , which appeared whiter than snow , the embroidered cambric , still moist with the cold dews of delirium , to which were now added those of terror .: 63.25
<S> noble natures never lose courage , nor good stomachs their appetites .: 154.09
<S> once outside , he and planchet set off as fast as they could ; and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate .: 74.81
<S> this is a detail preserved to us by brienne .: 66.18
<S> the more so , sir , as it was men s and not god s doing . tell me of those men , said the abbe , and remember too , he added in an almost menacing tone , you have promised to tell me everything .: 47.57
<S> the storm broke about ten o clock .: 21.76
<S> and now you are assembled , gentlemen , said d artagnan , permit me to offer you my apologies . at this word apologies , a cloud passed over the brow of athos , a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos , and a negative sign was the reply of aramis .: 27.82
<S> well , i sold my shares , the news got out , and i no longer sold i gave them away , next day i find the news was false , and by this false report i have lost 700,000 francs . well ? well , since i gave you a fourth of my gains , i think you owe me a fourth of my losses ; the fourth of 700,000 francs is 175,000 francs . what you say is absurd , and i can not see why m. debray s name is mixed up in this affair . because if you do not possess the 175,000 francs i reclaim , you must have lent them to your friends , and m. debray is one of your friends . 30245m for shame ! exclaimed the baroness .: 44.41
<S> how is it possible for a poor mercer , who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards , to be accused of high treason ?: 65.71
<S> i tell you that you were wrong . the voice of the king was tremulous with anger .: 16.33
<S> but have the kindness to give the abbe busoni i told you he was not at home , repeated the valet .: 23.73
<S> monsieur bonacieux there was in all this , as may have been observed , one personage concerned , of whom , notwithstanding his precarious position , we have appeared to take but very little notice .: 71.11
<S> that your mother and m. de villefort are both coming to this dinner .: 54.88
<S> discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in france .: 144.92
<S> it was plain , by a paleness still greater than usual , and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face , that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping .: 62.20
<S> he was , notwithstanding , anxious to set out ; but his illness becoming more serious , he was forced to stop at villeroy .: 38.68
<S> but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure , without arms to defend himself ?: 70.81
<S> my poor euge nie , you must conceal your passion for the fine arts . i admire all that is beautiful , returned the young lady .: 39.23
<S> you can not go wrong the road is bordered by trees on both sides . good all right , said a voice almost lost in the distance .: 55.23
<S> he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price .: 58.02
<S> apropos !: 43.83
<S> for him those ten minutes were very long .: 79.49
<S> i must then place my life , my honor , my reputation , in your hands ? yes , yes , madame , you must ; and i will save them all . but how ?: 28.76
<S> me de ah was standing at the rack , eating his hay .: 276.07
<S> you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother , who was a bonapartist , because you are a royalist .: 21.91
<S> some of the men moved toward them .: 32.09
<S> there happened to be a sermon , which made the church very full of people .: 74.48
<S> they expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a fiery outburst .: 84.99
<S> certainly .: 41.71
<S> your name ? cried his eminence , for the third time .: 24.31
<S> it is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine !: 256.15
<S> seeing d artagnan about to leave her , milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the comte de wardes .: 44.09
<S> he soon perceived that a slope had been formed , and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied .: 70.36
<S> private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business . be easy on that score , m. morrel ; but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond ? i will let you know that directly i have seen m. de villefort , whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmond s favor .: 32.04
<S> when it was seen that danglars sold , the spanish funds fell directly .: 77.65
<S> he opened the window ; a bright yellow streak crossed the sky , and seemed to divide in half the poplars , which stood out in black relief on the horizon .: 53.52
<S> you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairs on the expulsion of don carlos .: 73.82
<S> let us attend to what is more pressing first , and then we will attend to my wound ; besides , it does not seem very dangerous . and they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy functionary .: 41.89
<S> the brother did not perceive this ; he had turned round to play with milady s favorite monkey , which had pulled him by the doublet .: 38.04
<S> villefort , approached noirtier .: 51.69
<S> the servant conducted him by the rue des petits champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the rue richelieu ; then they gained the private staircase and d artagnan was ushered into the oratory .: 47.45
<S> d artagnan had run , sword in hand , through all the neighboring streets , but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for .: 54.97
<S> at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm , and in an instant all were on the alert .: 36.07
<S> as for denying that i am your nephew , you will think twice about it , now that i have learned some things of which i was ignorant a year ago . and how does it concern me what you have learned ? said de winter .: 34.50
<S> he is awaiting your majesty at cours la reine . but in what carriage do we start ? i have provided for everything ; a carriage below is waiting for your majesty . let us go to the king . d artagnan bowed and followed the queen .: 42.13
<S> he probably had succumbed .: 114.31
<S> he is a young , ingenuous , pure man who seems virtuous ; him there are means of destroying . and milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips .: 53.67
<S> well , said he , i will swim on until i am worn out , or the cramp seizes me , and then i shall sink ; and he struck out with the energy of despair .: 37.39
<S> spur your horses !: 79.10
<S> monsieur de bouillon had the gout , but notwithstanding his illness , which had prevented his mounting on horseback for the last month that is , since paris had been besieged he was ready to receive the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay .: 30.35
<S> and now , said the duke , raising it still six inches higher , jump for the king . the dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane .: 42.42
<S> an instant later , the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs , steps drew near , the door opened , and a man appeared .: 22.51
<S> monsieur d artagnan is my tenant , although he does not pay me my rent and even better on that account ought i to know him .: 40.15
<S> no news had been received of them ; only a letter , all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters , had come for aramis .: 126.88
<S> too many diamonds , too much gold and splendor , are now reflected by the mirror in which monte cristo seeks to behold dante s .: 69.29
<S> at the same time merce de s reappeared , paler than before , but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore .: 29.72
<S> yes , especially if you will show me the poor abbe s room . ah !: 31.70
<S> i leave you alone in your struggle with misfortune alone with that strong winged eagle which god sends to bear aloft the elect to his feet .: 201.29
<S> if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement , you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg electronic works in your possession .: 11.53
<S> morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount , in which , without assigning any reason , he begged him to go to the opera , but he understood that something terrible was brooding .: 40.36
<S> at midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park .: 16.18
<S> by her step she must be young ; perhaps she is pretty .: 63.64
<S> having been several times up and down it , he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again .: 97.07
<S> why didn t they search more vigilantly ?: 146.58
<S> calm and dignified , said he .: 18.47
<S> if you will only agree to my request , i promise you never to mention another word about escaping . the abbe smiled .: 37.48
<S> although of a paleness that was almost livid , this man had a remarkably handsome face ; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling ; his nose , quite straight , and projecting direct from the brow , was of the pure greek type , while his teeth , as white as pearls , were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them .: 50.76
<S> to the visitors room ! said the same voice .: 31.45
<S> stay , said d artagnan , and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door . when mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw d artagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there , with their arms .: 42.31
<S> i received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea , and to conduct you to this castle .: 24.53
<S> yes , i recognize it ! d artagnan ran to the door and pushed the bolt .: 16.66
<S> he was engaged in an adventure so singular that he wished for counsel .: 42.33
<S> milady will then turn you out of doors , and you know she is not the woman to limit her vengeance . alas ! said kitty , for whom have i exposed myself to all that ? for me , i well know , my sweet girl , said d artagnan .: 38.47
<S> here are the horse s hoofs again , it seems , athos , he said carelessly .: 36.95
<S> and since i found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate to be close to you without really seeing you have i ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength ?: 76.37
<S> the count told baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest , who began by sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction , and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine .: 51.10
<S> it almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to hopes .: 147.29
<S> he was spoken of as the most adroit , the strongest , and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around ; and although teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the sabines , no one had ever spoken to her of love , because it was known that she was beloved by vampa .: 49.73
<S> d artagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick , where his glance could penetrate to the supposed cavalier .: 57.05
<S> and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor ? villefort looked at the count almost with terror .: 55.51
<S> in the first place , there is a little intrigante named bonacieux . she is in the prison of nantes . that is to say , she was there , replied milady ; but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a convent . to a convent ? said the duke .: 26.89
<S> fortunately he is a cunning fellow , that friend caderousse . there you are beginning again to ramble , to talk again and again of the past !: 106.46
<S> there is no harm in over precaution .: 65.88
<S> he found kitty at the gate , and , as on the preceding evening , went up to her chamber .: 16.71
<S> the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue .: 45.26
<S> be more economical . but when i have no more money left to pay you ? asked the infuriated danglars .: 83.64
<S> this was simply because he lived in the ho tel .: 30.27
<S> over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs , dyed beneath persia s sun , or woven by the fingers of the women of calcutta or of chandernagor .: 111.40
<S> i suspect a hoax is intended , but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with .: 116.88
<S> by the governor s orders , said he , conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath . to the dungeon , then , said the corporal .: 41.38
<S> god is wearied ; he has punished you . caderousse was fast sinking .: 84.00
<S> that was five years ago .: 20.26
<S> who knows , when i shall be at liberty , that i may not satisfy your curiosity ? and will you make the same promise to my love ? cried d artagnan , beside himself with joy .: 32.16
<S> then he laid it down , seized his pen , and wrote a few words .: 21.64
<S> who ?: 55.31
<S> yes , gentlemen , the king in person , the king who has come to ask for some account of what has happened . what is the matter , sire ? exclaimed lord leven .: 21.89
<S> as we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the puritan .: 52.28
<S> but all this eager attention might have been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in the ho tel .: 85.05
<S> he seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom , sculptured in flesh and bone .: 76.10
<S> devil s coachman ! cried friquet , you re meddling too !: 78.77
<S> tis you , la ramee ; in faith , tis time you came back again .: 85.63
<S> dante s had not eaten since the preceding evening , but he had not thought of hunger , nor did he think of it now .: 22.06
<S> you do not know with whom you have to deal ! 50253m peppino made a sign , and the youth hastily removed the fowl .: 38.05
<S> there is , said he , at the end of his meditations , a clever maxim , which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago , and that is , that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind , human nature , in a right and wholesome state , revolts at crime .: 82.70
<S> pale , with a dull eye and heavy heart , all the noble features of that face , usually so calm and serene , were overcast by grief .: 50.75
<S> it was a very simple , natural circumstance and yet it created a profound sensation .: 50.70
<S> all night he heard the subterranean workman , who continued to mine his way .: 63.67
<S> as to that , cried d artagnan , after a moment of reflection , i shall surmount it , be assured . how so ? i will go this very evening to tre ville , whom i will request to ask this favor for me of his brother in law , monsieur dessessart . but another thing . what ? asked d artagnan , seeing that mme .: 27.49
<S> the ferry across the oise .: 108.04
<S> a terrible vision chapter xli .: 46.92
<S> it is you who , with that mandate , obtained the pasha s ring , which gave you authority over selim , the fire keeper !: 72.05
<S> that s well , said he to planchet , when the latter added the portmanteau to the equipment .: 37.19
<S> ho ! exclaimed the latter , the cardinal !: 16.60
<S> he , who returned to france with millions , had been unable to find the grave of his father , who had perished from hunger .: 26.16
<S> athos bowed .: 20.47
<S> everybody noticed that the king looked dull and preoccupied .: 61.49
<S> it consisted , as we have said , of a small dressing room , opening into a bedroom , and , when the door of communication was shut , the inmates were quite alone .: 35.80
<S> they both stood in amazement at the door .: 20.78
<S> sir , she replied , did i not say , and did you not hear me say to those people , that you should do as you pleased ? in that case , said mazarin , i think it must please me best to remain ; not only on account of my own interest , but for your safety . remain , then , sir ; nothing can be more agreeable to me ; only do not allow me to be insulted . you are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them ?: 33.25
<S> bonacieux , raising her hands to her forehead , i shall go mad ! stop what ? i hear a horse s steps ; it is my brother setting off again .: 46.25
<S> you will do for me what you have done for the queen ? certainly , d artagnan said to himself , he wishes to make me speak out .: 21.18
<S> you think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief , and you would cure it by an ordinary remedy change of scene . and morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity .: 67.13
<S> he consequently kept it as a piece of evidence , and being in safety behind the angle of the trench , he began to interrogate the wounded man .: 28.35
<S> that knife , give it to me for a minute only , for mercy s , for pity s sake !: 39.93
<S> she saw nothing ; she listened , and she heard nothing .: 32.57
<S> at the mention of monte cristo dante s started with joy ; he rose to conceal his emotion , and took a turn around the smoky tavern , where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca .: 51.27
<S> juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king .: 65.23
<S> zounds ! cried aramis , i may have done some good ; so , my lord , deign to receive my most respectful homage !: 40.63
<S> i told him very humbly for i could not conceal from myself the scrape i had got into by laying hands on one of his majesty s musketeers i told him i was quite ready to submit to his conditions .: 49.50
<S> noirtier s eye still retained its inanimate expression .: 71.04
<S> one of the sailors got down the side of the ship , seized the cable , and drew it ; it came without the least resistance .: 30.50
<S> the king ! they exclaimed , as all rose in bewilderment .: 63.75
<S> they were indeed two elegant horsemen , with figures slight and upright , noble faces , bright and proud looks , loyal and intelligent smiles .: 129.09
<S> come ! exclaimed aramis .: 12.64
<S> they saw , or rather continued to see , the image of what they had witnessed ; but little by little the general vertigo seized them , and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion .: 60.43
<S> they would have carried him to greenwich , he said , and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the hold .: 42.38
<S> it was chance that threw me in your way ; i saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends . one of your friends ? interrupted mme .: 38.59
<S> i misunderstood you .: 45.93
<S> it was dark and silent as the tomb .: 21.37
<S> he aimed a terrible blow at d artagnan , who avoided it by springing to one side ; but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit , who darted off toward the bastion .: 46.58
<S> i shall come back to dessert ; keep me some strawberries , coffee , and cigars .: 48.22
<S> when you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of louis xviii. , or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police .: 57.76
<S> ah , ah ! said bonacieux , you are a jocular companion !: 14.91
<S> he was about to marry a young and charming woman , whom he loved , not passionately , but reasonably , as became a deputy attorney of the king ; and besides her personal attractions , which were very great , mademoiselle de saint me ran s family possessed considerable political influence , which they would , of course , exert in his favor .: 46.79
<S> behold , madame !: 27.58
<S> then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling , but withdrew then , immediately , as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven , and that other judge named god .: 97.40
<S> farewell till we meet again , said aramis , as they took leave of planchet ; if anything happens to us we shall blame you for it . sir , said planchet , i am in all things at your service . that fellow is no fool , said aramis , as he got on his horse .: 34.42
<S> this fortnight expired , he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris , and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished , he therefore fixed three months ; three months passed away , then six more .: 71.93
<S> in twenty four hours he was attacked by a fever , and died three days afterwards .: 36.30
<S> thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down .: 38.53
<S> a moment later he came down again , holding in his hand the small shagreen case , which he opened , to assure himself it contained the diamond , seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in , then , as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket , he deposited it in his red handkerchief , which he carefully rolled round his head .: 45.47
<S> his face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day .: 70.09
<S> coquenard gently advised him to be patient .: 33.93
<S> for himself , he had no doubt she was a victim of the cardinal s vengeance ; and , as was well known , the vengeance of his eminence was terrible .: 26.98
<S> you will describe it to me , replied franz , and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if i had witnessed it .: 37.69
<S> gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness , on these nocturnal laborers , with a kind of fear ; he asked himself , if , after having called forth these foul creatures from their dens , he should have the power of making them retire again .: 70.77
<S> it is true that the indulgence of his foster mother encouraged him .: 34.29
<S> his air of perfect serenity made mazarin uneasy .: 177.69
<S> he left his address as he had done before , and set off again at the same pace for pontoise .: 30.36
<S> his speech , therefore , was so well turned , that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh , they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule .: 67.79
<S> edmond made great exertions in order to comply ; but at each effort he fell back , moaning and turning pale .: 72.75
<S> we will therefore leave the two friends , who had nothing important to say to each other , and follow aramis .: 32.16
<S> mazarin and guitant conversed together in whispers .: 129.52
<S> come hither , said mazarin in his softest voice ; i have an order to give you . d artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase , soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out .: 48.03
<S> no ; you do all this , not i. still it seems to me , that as you profit by it danglars shrugged his shoulders .: 47.97
<S> the catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a whole chapter , which , although it might be very instructive , would certainly afford our readers but little amusement .: 143.62
<S> what ?: 20.58
<S> for a week since he had resolved to die , and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose , edmond had not spoken to the attendant , had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him , and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him ; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it , and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments .: 47.80
<S> tomorrow , said he , you will be avenged , or i shall be dead . no , said she , you will avenge me ; but you will not be dead .: 16.23
<S> stay , sir , said anne to him .: 15.42
<S> i see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my supper . yes , sir ; for all i ve had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter , with preserves on it .: 74.10
<S> you remember what a beautiful night it was ?: 74.02
<S> now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference ? inquired aramis , perceiving that people were stopping to look at them , supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far famed duels still extant in the memory of the parisians , and especially the inhabitants of the place royale .: 48.60
<S> what matter , if you are paid for it ? said athos , and he threw two pistoles majestically on the table .: 25.30
<S> aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of st. augustine , which he was forced to write in latin for the following week , and which preoccupied him a good deal .: 71.77
<S> for people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand , his eminence had rarely recourse to such means .: 72.99
<S> monte cristo smiled at her unusual humility , and showed her two immense porcelain jars , over which wound marine plants , of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce .: 103.47
<S> the evening arrived ; all paris was in expectation .: 55.20
<S> if we were surprised , if it were known that we met thus , we should have no further resource . you are right , valentine ; but how shall i ascertain ? from the notary , m. deschamps . i know him . and for myself i will write to you , depend on me .: 32.60
<S> m. de blacas wiped the moisture from his brow .: 30.97
<S> the pavilion chapter xxv .: 28.86
<S> is it my father ? no . madame de villefort ? no . me ? the former sign was repeated .: 29.49
<S> ho , there , champenois !: 67.87
<S> whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of bazin s house .: 42.60
<S> now let us try to take our revenge . i will assist you with all my heart , monseigneur ; be assured of that . how did it come about ? at half past twelve the queen was with her women where ? in her bedchamber go on . when someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laundress . and then ? the queen immediately exhibited strong emotion ; and despite the rouge with which her face was covered evidently turned pale and then , and then ? she then arose , and with altered voice , ladies , said she , wait for me ten minutes , i shall soon return . she then opened the door of her alcove , and went out . why did not madame de lannoy come and inform you instantly ? nothing was certain ; besides , her majesty had said , ladies , wait for me , and she did not dare to disobey the queen . how long did the queen remain out of the chamber ? three quarters of an hour . none of her women accompanied her ? only donna estafania . did she afterward return ? yes ; but only to take a little rosewood casket , with her cipher upon it , and went out again immediately . and when she finally returned , did she bring that casket with her ? no . does madame de lannoy know what was in that casket ? yes ; the diamond studs which his majesty gave the queen . and she came back without this casket ? yes . madame de lannoy , then , is of opinion that she gave them to buckingham ? she is sure of it . how can she be so ? in the course of the day madame de lannoy , in her quality of tire woman of the queen , looked for this casket , appeared uneasy at not finding it , and at length asked information of the queen . and then the queen ? the queen became exceedingly red , and replied that having in the evening broken one of those studs , she had sent it to her goldsmith to be repaired . he must be called upon , and so ascertain if the thing be true or not . i have just been with him . and the goldsmith ? the goldsmith has heard nothing of it . well , well !: 64.54
<S> but what ails you ?: 11.51
<S> i was , therefore , obliged to give it up , as you may imagine , but i own i went away with rather a heavy heart , for the horse had looked at me affectionately , had rubbed his head against me and , when i mounted him , had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable , so that i was altogether fascinated with him .: 57.70
<S> in what can i have offended her i who ever since i have known her have lived at her feet like a slave ?: 73.32
<S> yes , yes ; and now i believe you are right , and that you have really saved my life ; be assured i will return the favor hereafter . villefort shook his head .: 21.78
<S> at drake s or aaron s one pays twenty five lire for common days , and thirty or thirty five lire a day more for sundays and feast days ; add five lire a day more for extras , that will make forty , and there s an end of it . i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage . then they must put horses to mine .: 82.97
<S> his eyes remained open and menacing .: 35.90
<S> d artagnan uttered a slight cry of joy ; this woman , or rather this apparition for the carriage passed with the rapidity of a vision was mme .: 33.62
<S> your tilbury , your groom , your clothes , are not then hired ?: 53.16
<S> it remains here ! said porthos , placing his hand on his heart , and pressing it strongly .: 19.62
<S> he had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables , and he placed them at the queen s disposal .: 25.10
<S> do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg license terms from this work , or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg .: 17.42
<S> has your uneasiness anything to do with what m. de blacas has told me , and m. de villefort has just confirmed ? m. de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron , but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman ; and besides , as matters were , it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect .: 44.75
<S> we must ask the comte de la fere the question .: 17.15
<S> it is miserable do you see ? always to wait till the end of the month . oh , said andrea philosophically , determined to watch his companion narrowly , does not life pass in waiting ?: 73.91
<S> selim repeated from time to time the sacred words : god is great ! however , my mother had still some hope .: 103.43
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> i am anxious to see that young man nearer . and wherefore ? aramis , you will certainly laugh at me , you will say that i am always repeating the same thing , you will call me the most timorous of visionaries ; but to whom do you see a resemblance in that young man ? in beauty or on the contrary ? asked aramis , laughing .: 44.83
<S> respect to fallen majesty .: 117.53
<S> they did not dare to ask him how he had slept .: 21.97
<S> and very princely , added cha teau renaud .: 19.59
<S> may i go and ask them , that i may have the opportunity of making my peace with you ? no , no , said noirtier s look .: 24.92
<S> we are lost ! no , said felton ; it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the guard . then run to the door , and open it yourself . felton obeyed ; this woman was now his whole thought , his whole soul .: 40.60
<S> impossible ! morrel started .: 37.26
<S> the third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows , then returned , and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations , and then dragged assunta feet foremost towards the brazier , expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted .: 82.57
<S> well , said porthos , seated in the courtyard of the hotel de la chevrette , to d artagnan , who , with a long and melancholy face , had returned from the palais royal ; did he receive you ungraciously , my dear friend ? i faith , yes !: 22.65
<S> go ! said the duke .: 9.00
<S> besides , the count will be in his own house , and only see them when he thinks fit to do so . thanks , monsieur , said monte cristo ; i shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband , if you will do me the honor to introduce me ; but i can not accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen , since my habitation is already prepared . what , cried morcerf ; you are , then , going to a hotel that will be very dull for you . was i so badly lodged at rome ? said monte cristo smiling .: 34.90
<S> gentlemen , said he , monseigneur s order is , you know , to conduct that woman , without losing time , to fort la pointe , and never to leave her till she is on board . as these words agreed wholly with the order they had received , they bowed their heads in sign of assent .: 51.06
<S> what is that ? asked aramis .: 5.47
<S> you jest !: 44.65
<S> yes , madame , said d artagnan ; but get in fearlessly , for i myself will drive you . the queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage , and the king and monsieur took their places at her side .: 25.86
<S> ay ! said porthos , the thing would not be impossible with a good plan . i have none , said athos ; but d artagnan will discover one . d artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded .: 27.80
<S> he found the troop in the glade , supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants ; but his eye vainly sought rita and cucumetto among them .: 130.09
<S> these gardeners are the most careless people in the world ; in bringing the horse out to the water they ve allowed him to walk over the border . d artagnan began to smile .: 59.69
<S> pray tell me how it happened . willingly .: 50.70
<S> is the king dead ?: 35.50
<S> dante s raised himself up and began to talk about everything ; about the bad quality of the food , about the coldness of his dungeon , grumbling and complaining , in order to have an excuse for speaking louder , and wearying the patience of his jailer , who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner .: 77.47
<S> i have no design upon your count , and you shall have him all to yourself .: 40.34
<S> he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask .: 18.94
<S> the count had spoken correctly .: 40.84
<S> peppino picked up the louis , and danglars again prepared to carve the fowl .: 75.08
<S> that is right ; i recommend the cardinal to your attention . make your mind easy , he is in good hands . planchet went out , the curate remaining for a moment .: 49.02
<S> faria , who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure , now perpetually talked of it .: 93.02
<S> come , come , tell me ; i am dying with curiosity and uneasiness ! athos , said d artagnan , getting rid of his female garments , and appearing in his shirt , prepare yourself to hear an incredible , an unheard of story . well , but put on this dressing gown first , said the musketeer to his friend .: 52.13
<S> he received yesterday a message from the prince de conde ; he went to meet him at saint cloud and has not returned . have you seen madame de chevreuse ? she was not at home .: 36.06
<S> but this did not arise from a want of affection ; on the contrary , from a firm conviction .: 43.52
<S> what do you want of me ? he asked .: 7.23
<S> well , you can ask my servant , or rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow , it was the talk of the house . and this elixir , where is it ?: 46.55
<S> thousands of grasshoppers , hidden in the bushes , chirped with a monotonous and dull note ; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind .: 95.91
<S> petition the minister . oh , i know what that is ; the minister receives two hundred petitions every day , and does not read three . that is true ; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me . and will you undertake to deliver it ? with the greatest pleasure .: 57.46
<S> this treasure exists , dante s , and if i have not been allowed to possess it , you will .: 27.98
<S> it was the king , who was passing through the streets which led from the louvre to the ho tel de ville , and which were all illuminated with colored lanterns .: 18.04
<S> blaisois went with him .: 30.46
<S> the neighbors who had opened their windows , with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances , closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black flee their instinct telling them that for the time all was over .: 80.18
<S> it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown , with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury .: 41.51
<S> major bartolomeo cavalcanti and count andrea cavalcanti , announced baptistin .: 54.61
<S> it is true , then , he said , rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companion , it is true , then , that all our actions leave their traces some sad , others bright on our paths ; it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sands ; it leaves its track !: 66.43
<S> open the door . the captain obeyed .: 24.90
<S> only to think of it makes my flesh crawl .: 140.33
<S> oh , you love her still , said kitty , who had not taken her eyes off the young man s countenance for an instant .: 17.59
<S> in the midst of one of these swoons i heard the door open .: 22.24
<S> come and roll me to bed .: 37.14
<S> come , accept my invitation , and my mother will thank you . a thousand thanks , said the count , your invitation is most gracious , and i regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it .: 33.79
<S> be assured , then , of seeing me soon return . capital ! cried athos ; you are the king of poets , my dear aramis .: 37.29
<S> i ought to have consulted you on the point , and have had some dishes prepared expressly . did you know me better , returned the count , smiling , you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself , who has successively lived on macaroni at naples , polenta at milan , olla podrida at valencia , pilau at constantinople , curry in india , and swallows nests in china .: 66.61
<S> valentine found her grandmother in bed ; silent caresses , heartwrung sobs , broken sighs , burning tears , were all that passed in this sad interview , while madame de villefort , leaning on her husband s arm , maintained all outward forms of respect , at least towards the poor widow .: 73.24
<S> to give your majesty s reply to those who await it . stay , marechal ; i will not appear to parley with rebels . madame , i have pledged my word , and unless you order me to be arrested i shall be forced to return . anne of austria s eyes shot glances of fire .: 52.23
<S> the villefort family vault chapter 75 .: 45.64
<S> he rose , and preceded by the host wringing his hands , and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use , he approached the scene of action .: 47.28
<S> milady s secret chapter xxxviii .: 39.37
<S> the ancona road , replied the baron .: 51.37
<S> when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded , without thinking to ask for any abatement .: 106.08
<S> the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets .: 39.93
<S> that makes no difference , said aramis , coloring ; and who affirmed , as i said , that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable , without informing me whence it came . it is only to poets that such things happen , said athos , gravely .: 66.45
<S> i mean that they have killed an enemy , which is a very different thing , returned the captain .: 25.54
<S> oh , why is not the world a wilderness ? she exclaimed , throwing herself into the arms of mademoiselle d armilly , her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made nero wish that the roman world had but one neck , that he might sever it at a single blow .: 48.47
<S> i was now safe , for i could swim along the ditch without being seen , and i reached the canal in safety .: 47.12
<S> repair your crimes toward her ; let her go free , and i will exact nothing else from you . you will exact ! said buckingham , looking at felton with astonishment , and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced them .: 62.35
<S> villefort met them at the door of his study ; having in a few words thanked the district doctor , he turned to d avrigny , and said : and now the priest . is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine ? asked d avrigny .: 43.82
<S> excellency , the evil has arrived ! m .: 85.07
<S> i , my lord ? said d artagnan ; why should i ? because you shrug your shoulders . it is a way i have of speaking to myself .: 30.91
<S> let us try what we can do , then , said the notary .: 15.73
<S> he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself , devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition ; he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission .: 123.74
<S> yes , sir , replied franz .: 6.23
<S> directly afterwards the moon rose .: 86.02
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> the two friends sat down to table ; but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristo s table and that of signor pastrini .: 21.78
<S> d artagnan saw that the moment was come .: 14.38
<S> the priest had a writing teacher at rome make three alphabets one large , one middling , and one small ; and pointed out to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a slate , and thus learn to write .: 126.22
<S> i might have handed him over to roman justice , which is somewhat expeditious , and which would have been particularly so with him ; but i did nothing of the sort i suffered him and his band to depart . with the condition that they should sin no more , said beauchamp , laughing .: 53.17
<S> the tall man had scarcely read these lines , seen the signature , and recognized the seal , when he bowed to denote that he had no longer any objection to make , and that he was ready to obey .: 31.82
<S> something better still , mouston . an expedition , sir ? asked the steward , whose roses began to change into lilies .: 107.40
<S> we will describe the thing to him as a consequence of the affair of yesterday , and the two will pass off together . m. de tre ville , accompanied by the four young fellows , directed his course toward the louvre ; but to the great astonishment of the captain of the musketeers , he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of st. germain .: 30.69
<S> what are you thinking about ? said the king ; go on , my good parry , unless you are tired . parry resumed his reading .: 31.21
<S> a moment afterwards , baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo , and the latter , leading hayde e aside , ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawing room .: 52.14
<S> i detest her , from antipathy . or , rather , by instinct . perhaps so .: 91.23
<S> he therefore informed m. morrel of his wish to quit the sea , and obtained a recommendation from him to a spanish merchant , into whose service he entered at the end of march , that is , ten or twelve days after napoleon s return .: 48.48
<S> what ! cried d artagnan .: 6.02
<S> but a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover .: 62.86
<S> athos ! cried the two musketeers .: 10.98
<S> put your names into a hat and draw lots . a good idea , said d artagnan .: 30.72
<S> from the ends of these two wings extended the park .: 46.10
<S> and this bed with red hangings , a bed visited by the goddess lucina ?: 127.59
<S> no ! no !: 23.41
<S> with whom with a child seven years old ? dear friend , at raoul s age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another , fancied or real .: 124.63
<S> luigi took her arm beneath his own , and led her to the door of the grotto .: 22.54
<S> shall i swear to you , sir ? asked maximilian .: 9.54
<S> one day he miraculously left the prison , transformed , rich , powerful .: 64.50
<S> and i , too , murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes .: 19.24
<S> it is impossible to know ; everything else might be guessed , but not that . at length athos went to bed , apparently , for the noise ceased .: 41.00
<S> save me ! i will not harm you . andrea , the murderer ! cried one of the ladies .: 30.22
<S> you said just now that you had a hundred friends . very true , but you introduced me at m. danglars . not at all !: 40.11
<S> the marines were removed .: 41.46
<S> barrois , said valentine , my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire , but there is a secret spring in it , which you know will you open it ? barrois looked at the old man .: 33.59
<S> my place of abode is no .: 85.74
<S> who are you , and what do you want ? cried she .: 11.19
<S> i see spots of blood on the ground . and he set off to follow the two friends .: 28.05
<S> my lord , he asked , where does your eminence wish monsieur comte de la fere to be lodged ? in the pavilion of the orangery , of course , in front of the pavilion where the guard is .: 29.09
<S> the two friends , as we see , were worthy of and understood one another .: 33.09
<S> and heaven knows there are hills enough between rome and florence by the way of aquapendente !: 101.48
<S> athos , who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one estate which gives him the title of comte , what is he to do with all those dignities the comte de la fere , comte de bragelonne ? and he has no children with all these titles ? ah ! said porthos , i have heard that he had adopted a young man who resembles him greatly . what , athos ?: 42.28
<S> before leaving the scaffold aramis had approached the opening where athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the king .: 39.85
<S> pity me !: 48.56
<S> why ? just remember what they said .: 54.62
<S> she was mad with passion .: 30.51
<S> the young man , standing up before her , gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome .: 53.27
<S> i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you .: 23.49
<S> mademoiselle , mademoiselle ! exclaimed a voice from behind the trees .: 35.66
<S> milady remained for some minutes in the same position , for she thought they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole ; she then slowly raised her head , which had resumed its formidable expression of menace and defiance , ran to the door to listen , looked out of her window , and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair , she reflected .: 46.58
<S> he bounded like a chamois , cocking his carbine as he went , and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller .: 31.48
<S> no one who knew the count could mistake his expression when , on entering , he said : ali , bring me my pistols with the ivory cross . ali brought the box to his master , who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot .: 50.34
<S> the war with spain being ended , fernand s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout europe .: 158.27
<S> heaven forgive me , they do not know that we can see them , and they are actually embracing ! danglars did not lose one pang that fernand endured .: 49.23
<S> euge nie concealed louise in an angle of the gateway , so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person .: 60.94
<S> monsieur de chavigny , be so good as to lend me your cane . monsieur de chavigny handed his cane to monsieur de beaufort .: 28.39
<S> all i can tell about her , replied the countess , is , that she has been at rome since the beginning of the season ; for i saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season , and since then she has never missed a performance .: 61.34
<S> did you know that i am at liberty ? i knew it from the fountain head from planchet .: 37.05
<S> the young peasant girl , at first timid and scared , soon recovered herself .: 60.20
<S> d artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect , and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinal s letter it was , however , merely a letter of introduction .: 48.48
<S> the countess g insists upon it that he is a vampire . then the countess g has returned to paris , has she ? inquired the baroness .: 35.08
<S> see , i have sold my watch for 100 francs , and the guard and seals for 300 .: 87.55
<S> no one can say that m. noirtier did not love his child , and yet he sleeps . yes , you are right , replied villefort , surprised ; he sleeps , indeed !: 23.20
<S> send me five hundred pistoles , and four or five days after i have received them i shall be in paris . on the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him .: 31.92
<S> when left alone , the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence .: 67.55
<S> and yet that woman deserved her fate ; do you not think so ? on one s death bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with one s own , said the executioner ; and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes .: 70.30
<S> your eminence may be certain of that . the cardinal turned and said in a loud voice , rochefort ! the chevalier , who no doubt was near the door , entered immediately .: 32.34
<S> as long as they were within the circle of the camp , the four friends did not exchange one word ; besides , they were followed by the curious , who , hearing of the wager , were anxious to know how they would come out of it .: 23.06
<S> i wish to be providence myself , for i feel that the most beautiful , noblest , most sublime thing in the world , is to recompense and punish . satan bowed his head , and groaned .: 46.42
<S> now , young man , regulate your conduct accordingly ; and if you entertain , whether from your family , your relations , or even from your instincts , any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal , bid me adieu and let us separate .: 79.17
<S> athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears ; but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly .: 84.31
<S> oh , second father , he exclaimed , thou who hast given me liberty , knowledge , riches ; thou who , like beings of a superior order to ourselves , couldst understand the science of good and evil ; if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth ; if after death the soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered , then , noble heart , sublime soul , then i conjure thee by the paternal love thou didst bear me , by the filial obedience i vowed to thee , grant me some sign , some revelation !: 127.66
<S> do you intend to struggle against our ill fortune ?: 50.31
<S> keep your money keep it , i say ; one never has too much ; but , at the same time , my boy , i am as much obliged by your offer as if i took advantage of it . it was offered with good will , said dante s .: 36.65
<S> with your tastes , and means of gratifying them , continued danglars , you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade .: 123.12
<S> i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity . and what do you mean to do ? to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men , who , at a signal from me , will rush forward directly peppino is brought for execution , and , by the assistance of their stilettos , drive back the guard , and carry off the prisoner . that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain , and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours . and what is your excellency s project ? just this .: 54.10
<S> in after years , whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents , which ought to have cemented our friendship , or whether he did not recollect me , he sought to take me , but , on the contrary , it was i who captured him and a dozen of his band .: 35.38
<S> once more , replied the major .: 26.99
<S> i arrived three hours after her at boulogne .: 50.09
<S> to this question de guiche could not respond .: 48.48
<S> well , then , said the host , your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago ; he will dine at mazingarbe and sleep at cambrin . how far is mazingarbe ? two miles and a half . thank you . grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time , when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man .: 41.34
<S> athos did not move .: 22.62
<S> at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht , as it disappeared in the gulf of porto vecchio .: 40.02
<S> he saw nothing , unless that , by traces of smoke , others had before him attempted the same thing , and , like him , in vain .: 51.58
<S> the comtesse de winter , with whom i had quarreled , became reconciled to me at that ball .: 41.59
<S> i will write a letter today to the director of the royal academy , and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to yourself .: 31.13
<S> and how proceed ? it is now eleven , answered grimaud .: 31.81
<S> is it you ? she said .: 11.02
<S> at the end of a few minutes monsieur raised his voice , and said , i want for this mission three or four volunteers , led by a man who can be depended upon . as to the man to be depended upon , i have him under my hand , monsieur , said m. dessessart , pointing to d artagnan ; and as to the four or five volunteers , monsieur has but to make his intentions known , and the men will not be wanting . four men of good will who will risk being killed with me ! said d artagnan , raising his sword .: 43.74
<S> de saint me ran had always expressed a desire , in case his death happened during his absence from paris , that his body might be brought to the family vault .: 58.16
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> the duke , in order to pass away another quarter of an hour , pretended to be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter .: 51.97
<S> the cable is cut ! he cried , no boat ! how !: 71.08
<S> bernouin cast an inquisitorial glance at the person of the young man and entered the cabinet of the cardinal , to whom he transmitted the messenger s words .: 33.67
<S> coquenard had met porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made upon his handsome spanish genet , she would not have regretted the bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband .: 88.85
<S> he soon felt that his ideas became again collected he could think , and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning .: 85.94
<S> it is true that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife , he has no need to seek happiness elsewhere .: 44.25
<S> i have looked at it with all possible attention , said dante s , and i only see a half burnt paper , on which are traces of gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink . this paper , my friend , said faria , i may now avow to you , since i have the proof of your fidelity this paper is my treasure , of which , from this day forth , one half belongs to you . the sweat started forth on dante s brow .: 47.50
<S> ah , i always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter ! and she greedily read the following few lines : my dear child , hold yourself ready .: 84.38
<S> the other was forced to wait , and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the delay .: 35.07
<S> have you seen him ?: 11.02
<S> the rock , already shaken by the explosion , tottered on its base .: 37.82
<S> grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away , and i am convinced they would have left us in peace . i doubt that , replied d artagnan , for they are advancing very resolutely .: 27.72
<S> they could willingly have strangled m. de tre ville , if , at the bottom of all this , they had not felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus .: 46.00
<S> this separation , which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance , would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded .: 60.31
<S> i have seen his servant , said one , and that applies very well to me . well ? he must certainly be at noisy , or be coming there this evening , said the other ; and that applies very well to you . what else ? then the prince said : take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier ; which seems to me to leave no room for doubt , since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers .: 47.10
<S> the murderer , supposing him dead , let fall his head and disappeared .: 51.30
<S> never forget me . oh !: 34.33
<S> since the bandits had not despatched him at once , he felt that they would not kill him at all .: 32.59
<S> d artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head , and entered the inn without reply .: 21.43
<S> as to d artagnan , he did not budge from his apartment .: 11.85
<S> do you think so , sir ?: 10.30
<S> i must confess that i was mistaken .: 14.14
<S> beware !: 43.76
<S> to be imprisoned .: 49.70
<S> this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh , such a real ear clipper did porthos appear .: 110.04
<S> every one arose .: 41.00
<S> lying dressed upon his bed , the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart .: 56.29
<S> i know him well there !: 35.04
<S> it is a casket of wood bound with iron , thought he .: 46.17
<S> take one step more , said i , and in addition to my dishonor , you shall have my death to reproach yourself with . there was , no doubt , in my look , my voice , my whole person , that sincerity of gesture , of attitude , of accent , which carries conviction to the most perverse minds , for he paused .: 65.51
<S> impossible , doctor ; it is too late ; my throat is closing up .: 34.66
<S> alas ! said felton , i can do but one thing , which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim !: 29.35
<S> a terrible inclination seized d artagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him ; but , as we have said , he was a very prudent youth , and he restrained himself .: 23.89
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> are the oars in the boat ? everything is ready . tis well . mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot , in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match .: 46.97
<S> the praise was well deserved , for had not the count heard it from the baroness , or by one of those means by which he knew everything , the baron s countenance would not have led him to suspect it .: 42.98
<S> when you please , replied beauchamp ; allow me only to compliment m. de morcerf , who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity . oh , yes , said cha teau renaud .: 36.20
<S> ah , cowards !: 30.14
<S> the door had been opened , and shut again ; the mercer s pretty wife had disappeared .: 29.94
<S> as to dante s , he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant , but never touched at it .: 44.44
<S> twenty good pistoles , already , without reckoning the doctor .: 75.79
<S> gentlemen , you see , said the duke to those present , who dared not even smile , that it is the illustrious coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world ; at least , according to pistache . let us go on to another of his exercises . gentlemen ! there was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed them do you not remember that the duc de guise taught all the dogs in paris to jump for mademoiselle de pons , whom he styled the fairest of the fair ? pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs .: 53.63
<S> he had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life .: 55.49
<S> do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over .: 145.78
<S> the garden was crossed by a path of red gravel , edged by a border of thick box , of many years growth , and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of delacroix , our modern rubens .: 63.87
<S> the scotch , my brothers !: 35.21
<S> i am just as poor a gascon as when i saw you at meung , twenty two years ago , you know ; alas ! and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh .: 42.31
<S> general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg electronic works 1.a .: 19.61
<S> i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain particelli upon me . sire , replied richelieu , rest assured that particelli , the man to whom your majesty refers , has been hanged . ah ; so much the better ! exclaimed the king .: 40.38
<S> that was the question the three musketeers put to one another .: 33.01
<S> but what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk , brought up in the school of cardinal richelieu ?: 50.51
<S> after a moment of dumb contemplation , during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end , he sprang towards the door , crying out : doctor , doctor !: 23.99
<S> i told you the day before yesterday to bring them with you ; why have you not done so ? they are below , sire , and with your permission la chesnaye will bid them come up . yes , yes , let them come up immediately .: 48.15
<S> when madame de beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal , the child , who had been absorbed in the pages of quintus curtius , enlivened as they were by engravings of alexander s feats of arms , frowned and looked at his mother .: 52.41
<S> you approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock .: 134.16
<S> de wardes , one of the cardinal s men , a cousin of rochefort !: 28.47
<S> he sent one of his servants to m. de la tre mouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinal s guardsmen from his house , and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making sortie against the king s musketeers .: 35.55
<S> franz resolved to wait for albert as late as possible .: 53.99
<S> yellow boys ? said caderousse ; no , i thank you . oh , you despise them . on the contrary , i esteem them , but will not have them . you can change them , idiot ; gold is worth five sous . exactly ; and he who changes them will follow friend caderousse , lay hands on him , and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold .: 82.49
<S> your excellency has not stated the number of guests . ah , true . how many covers ? count for yourself . is everyone here , your excellency ? yes . bertuccio glanced through the door , which was ajar .: 44.29
<S> at nine o clock tomorrow rita s father will be here with the money . it is well ; in the meantime , we will have a merry night ; this young girl is charming , and does credit to your taste .: 34.57
<S> very well done ! the exclamation was drawn from athos by seeing the sword of cahusac fly twenty paces from him .: 99.50
<S> d artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of devotion .: 64.82
<S> he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball .: 41.76
<S> strength and sagacity continued .: 55.49
<S> come , come , cried d artagnan , we must finish with this , and in his turn he pressed mordaunt hard , who continued to lose ground , but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a moment .: 62.53
<S> the conflict was not long ; the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arquebus .: 77.76
<S> i confess it , replied albert .: 12.07
<S> now , if you are mad and try to bite me , i will kill you without pity .: 24.35
<S> i resist my father s order , and my dying grandmother s wish ?: 50.28
<S> he thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom faria offered the treasures .: 55.27
<S> your eminence , said comminges , as i was re conducting the young man for whom you have asked , he approached the glass door of the gallery , and gazed intently upon some object , doubtless the picture by raphael , which is opposite the door .: 58.06
<S> i am profoundly ignorant of all these stock jobbing intrigues . because , said albert , laughing , one piece of news follows another , and there is often great dissimilarity between them . ah , said the count , i see that m. danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300,000 francs in a day ; he must be enormously rich . it is not he who plays ! exclaimed lucien ; it is madame danglars ; she is indeed daring . but you who are a reasonable being , lucien , and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news , since you are at the fountain head , surely you ought to prevent it , said morcerf , with a smile .: 53.43
<S> some unknown enemy an invisible foe has done this . the more must you fortify yourself , albert .: 251.95
<S> as for porthos , he looked inquiringly at d artagnan .: 12.65
<S> foreigner ! he ejaculated , italian !: 85.58
<S> yes . shall my father be informed of your wish ? yes . do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately ? yes . then they shall go for him directly , dear grandpapa .: 33.82
<S> the light had almost disappeared from the former ; doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp , and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window .: 62.38
<S> yes ; and as i am just now excessively annoyed , i shall go from home .: 37.17
<S> as he had twenty times touched at leghorn , he remembered a barber in st. ferdinand street ; he went there to have his beard and hair cut .: 102.93
<S> ho !: 16.63
<S> i knew you were gloomy , and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta ; and i overlooked that in italy , because in italy those things are thought nothing of .: 97.50
<S> recollect what our excellent father so often told us , it was no englishman that thus saved us . monte cristo started .: 84.49
<S> after having touched , felt , examined these treasures , edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy ; he leaped on a rock , from whence he could behold the sea .: 77.02
<S> shall i leave you ?: 19.65

<S> what do they say ? that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is nothing . what nonsense ! said franz , reseating himself .: 72.11
<S> still , said barrois , with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant , if m. noirtier asks for a notary , i suppose he really wishes for a notary ; therefore i shall go at once and fetch one . barrois acknowledged no master but noirtier , and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted .: 58.66
<S> franz waited until all was in order , and when the sail was filled , and the four sailors had taken their places three forward , and one at the helm he resumed the conversation .: 56.46
<S> but you , my dear d artagnan , what has happened to you ? so that this strain of the knee , continued d artagnan , my dear porthos , keeps you in bed ? my god , that s all .: 19.54
<S> my father meant me for the navy and i have some vague notions about navigation . you see ! cried d artagnan .: 54.88
<S> d artagnan followed , but less nimbly , showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed .: 50.45
<S> hell has made you rich , hell has given you another name , hell has almost made you another face ; but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your body . milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring , and her eyes flashed lightning .: 94.87
<S> i repeat to you , however , and this time on my word of honor i think perhaps too often that i am in haste , great haste .: 38.05
<S> and if i refuse to retract , you wish to fight , do you ? said beauchamp in a calm tone .: 27.52
<S> it appeared to me such women as i never weep , said milady .: 39.06

<S> porthos paid no attention .: 35.61
<S> ah , fie ! d artagnan replied .: 19.84
<S> as we were sure of finding him there , we left him alone . yes , said d artagnan , you did not really wish to kill ; you only wished to imprison him . good god !: 33.72
<S> bonacieux he ran , full of joy , to seek his comrades , whom he had left only half an hour before , but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied .: 47.91
<S> my name has been mentioned to you the comte de la fere ; you do not know that name .: 14.57
<S> through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind , not of the woman , but of the poet .: 67.03

<S> because , after nightfall , you are not safe fifty yards from the gates . on your honor , is that true ? cried albert .: 37.50
<S> he is at vincennes . did i say monsieur de beaufort ?: 25.11

<S> ah , but the valise i want , cried porthos , is a well filled one , my dear . madame uttered fresh sighs .: 81.21

<S> bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice ; she reopened her eyes , cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so , and at once perceiving it was d artagnan , she uttered a cry of joy , oh , it is you , it is you !: 26.29
<S> do you say that m. noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m. le baron franz d e pinay ? yes , sir , that is the reason , said villefort , shrugging his shoulders .: 14.37
<S> yes , my lord , and from pure devotion to the cause , for monsieur de bracieux is rich . rich ! said mazarin , whom that single word always inspired with a great respect .: 47.18

<S> what did your excellency say ? inquired the other .: 12.28
<S> this evening , then , at nine o clock . adieu till then . notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of monte cristo , whose lips turned pale , but who preserved his ceremonious smile , andrea seized the count s hand , pressed it , jumped into his phaeton , and disappeared .: 34.42

<S> on his wife s request , m. de villefort was the first to give the signal of departure .: 17.90
<S> but if his morals were shocked on the landing , his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber .: 70.96
<S> and taking it from felton , he cast a rapid glance over the paper , and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him , he placed it on the table , took a pen , and prepared to sign it .: 17.12
<S> no , you are a physician !: 16.09
<S> as for myself , i can assure you of one thing , the more men you see die , the easier it becomes to die yourself ; and in my opinion , death may be a torture , but it is not an expiation . i do not quite understand you , replied franz ; pray explain your meaning , for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch . listen , said the count , and deep hatred mounted to his face , as the blood would to the face of any other .: 49.76
<S> we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health , d artagnan . to your health ! repeated porthos and aramis .: 36.68
<S> she must live that my infamy may diminish hers . and villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage .: 74.56
<S> a minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened , and monte cristo appeared .: 27.74
<S> well , while i was watching not the king , as monsieur le comte thinks , for i know what it is to see a man led to death , and though i ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill while i was watching the masked executioner , the idea came to me , as i said , to find out who he was .: 47.14
<S> and you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter ? i give you my word of honor , sir , said dante s ; but what is the matter ?: 11.11
<S> and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it ; but the hesitation with which he proceeded , stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took , convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person .: 60.66
<S> he ordered him to go and saddle two horses in m. de tre ville s stables one for himself , d artagnan , and one for planchet and bring them to athos s place .: 29.87
<S> but , my lieutenant , said a soldier , less stoical than his chief , and who had approached milady , this woman is not asleep . what , not asleep ! said felton ; what is she doing , then ? she has fainted .: 44.59
<S> keep the lieutenancy , my dear , keep it . the young man then entered the apartment of aramis .: 37.42
<S> at times the state into which i had fallen appeared so strange that i believed myself dreaming .: 119.15
<S> in no instance , let us say , was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his minions .: 102.34
<S> however , this time , my tranquillity , or passiveness as philosophers say , proceeded from another source ; it proceeded from a wish , like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl , to practice obedience . well ? asked danglars .: 82.75
<S> you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works , reports , performances and research .: 34.59
<S> as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood stained garments , i involuntarily surveyed myself , and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte .: 85.65
<S> go to england , join the king , be his friends , protectors , march to battle at his side , and be near him in his house , where conspiracies , more dangerous than the perils of war , are hatching every day .: 55.27
<S> have you a heart ?: 17.13
<S> the duke , more and more bewildered , let grimaud loose and took the note .: 63.10
<S> the coal black hair , large bright , glittering eyes , in which a wild , unearthly fire seems burning , the same ghastly paleness .: 89.07
<S> milady sat down to table , ate from several dishes , drank a little spanish wine , and felt all her resolution return .: 48.60
<S> goeden day , broder , replied the astonished landlady .: 67.37
<S> he forgot the necessary slowness of navigation ; he exaggerated to himself the power of milady .: 59.93
<S> ha ! laughed the apparition , every gentleman seems to have the same fancy , for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad , well mounted like you , as tall as you and of about your age , halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here , and dined here , with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor , upon a pie , of which they haven t left a mouthful , and two bottles of macon wine , of which they haven t left a drop , but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left , and if your worship will but give your orders no , friend , replied raoul , smiling , i am obliged to you , but at this moment i want nothing but the things for which i have asked only i shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good ; upon these conditions i will pay for the pen the price of the bottle , and for the ink the price of the pie . very well , sir , said the host , i ll give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant , and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain . do as you like , said raoul , who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society , who , when there were robbers on the highroads , were connected with them , and who , since highwaymen no longer exist , have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place .: 68.23
<S> come , i beseech you , lend me twenty francs , so that i may buy a dressing gown ; it is intolerable always to be in a coat and boots !: 54.81
<S> it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place , as the young man was received at the banker s as the betrothed .: 41.34
<S> what is this ? it is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in my arms . in your arms ? that man !: 33.11
<S> go , monsieur duke , and return often .: 83.23
<S> still , in spite of this , albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres ; but , alas , his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away , and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure .: 77.88
<S> for my part , i should not hesitate a moment ; i should take the hundred pistoles .: 16.49
<S> bazin !: 94.07

<S> the abbe busoni ! repeated caderousse , fixing his haggard gaze on the count .: 21.23

<S> zounds !: 34.39
<S> this night i have had a fearful sleep .: 39.51
<S> do you wish him to read it ? said valentine .: 13.16
<S> in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone , whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by d artagnan and porthos .: 32.62
<S> gaetano skirted the light , carefully keeping the boat in the shadow ; then , when they were opposite the fire , he steered to the centre of the circle , singing a fishing song , of which his companions sung the chorus .: 55.69
<S> the sentinel opened the door ; it was a new face .: 19.23
<S> d artagnan obeyed .: 9.83
<S> now , then , do you wish for anything else ? said the patron .: 11.52
<S> come , hermine , he said , after a short time , answer candidly , something vexes you is it not so ? 30239m nothing , answered the baroness .: 28.31
<S> well ! said andrea , my servant s coat and my hat ? ah , said caderousse , you would not like me to risk taking cold ? but what am i to do ? you ?: 39.53
<S> a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure , entered , and joined the musketeers .: 53.58
<S> albert , with his eyes closed , was standing grasping the window curtains .: 57.28

<S> bonacieux was .: 28.41
<S> i should injure the queen instead of serving her . well , since the best motives are liable to misconstruction , the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a refusal a distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal ; yes , her majesty the queen rochefort smiled contemptuously .: 83.75
<S> if the poor lad were living , and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends , why , perhaps , i should not hesitate .: 88.79
<S> yes , answered monte cristo happily , yes , conscience does remain ; and if it did not , how wretched we should be !: 62.37
<S> have you been to the general ? said mordaunt to d artagnan and porthos ; you know he sent for you after the action . we want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety , replied d artagnan .: 29.78

<S> valentine , will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love i bear you ? valentine started .: 41.49

<S> at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet , and his guides let go their hold of him .: 55.82
<S> freed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant manners of an old governor of the port , who kissed her hand , she only remained long enough at boulogne to put into the post a letter , conceived in the following terms : to his eminence monseigneur the cardinal richelieu , in his camp before la rochelle .: 108.19

<S> he never gave advice but when it was asked , and even then he required to be asked twice .: 79.47
<S> didn t you hear , fellow ? yes , i heard . why , then , didn t you reply ? because these horses are not to be sold , was the reply .: 29.13
<S> here is debray , who detests you without reading you , so he says . he is quite right , returned beauchamp ; for i criticise him without knowing what he does .: 50.81
<S> but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried ? did i not tell you just now that i was rich , maximilian too rich ?: 40.36
<S> at length i received this letter from your friend , which states that my father is in paris , and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him . really , all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting , said monte cristo , observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction ; and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend sinbad ; for your father is indeed here , and is seeking you . the count from the moment of first entering the drawing room , had not once lost sight of the expression of the young man s countenance ; he had admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice ; but at these words , so natural in themselves , your father is indeed here , and is seeking you , young andrea started , and exclaimed , my father ?: 40.50
<S> and madame de villefort , two ; m. and madame danglars , four ; m. de cha teau renaud , m. debray , m. morrel , seven ; major bartolomeo cavalcanti , eight . eight ! repeated bertuccio .: 52.47
<S> ordinarily , prisoners were interrogated in their cells ; but they did not do so with m. bonacieux .: 63.28
<S> what is death for me ?: 42.48
<S> my own service ! said d artagnan .: 13.21
<S> the sounds drew nearer .: 30.06
<S> and why ? your excellency will know when you have read the letter . shall i find you here , then ? certainly . franz entered the hotel .: 27.41
<S> you you ? said the young man , looking fearfully around him .: 22.57
<S> in fact , aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the louvre , no one appeared to be aware that charles i. had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold .: 35.71
<S> if she is a cardinalist , she has no fanaticism , at least . she then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his enemies .: 50.43
<S> but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister .: 50.35
<S> in five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded , and then restraining their horses , they advanced cautiously .: 29.97
<S> tis you , then , my dear count , cried gondy , offering his hand .: 13.65
<S> instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town , mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched .: 93.94
<S> hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances , not men .: 231.41
<S> porthos gained fifty pistoles from groslow , and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be .: 45.30
<S> it was then , upon the manifestation of this astonishment , that d artagnan related to him the precaution taken , and how , thanks to the devotion of his three friends , whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road , he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust , which had pierced the queen s letter and for which he had repaid m. de wardes with such terrible coin .: 40.71
<S> the old man winked his eyes expressively , which we may remember was his only way of expressing his approval .: 96.46
<S> the ho tel , then , is far away ? at the other end of the town . very well , said milady ; and she resolutely entered the carriage .: 19.79
<S> very pretty ! but to the great astonishment of d artagnan , the shutter remained closed .: 30.87
<S> at these words madame morrel rose , and threw herself into her son s arms .: 17.10
<S> listen , then , lord winter .: 22.11
<S> all these women had been , or were , beautiful .: 54.57
<S> rene e was , with all the rest of the company , anxiously awaiting him , and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation .: 30.06
<S> carlini besought his chief to make an exception in rita s favor , as her father was rich , and could pay a large ransom .: 66.21
<S> gentlemen , resumed the newcomer , you are , as i am , in search of a woman who , added he , with a terrible smile , must have passed this way , for i see a corpse . the three friends remained mute for although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen , they could not remember under what circumstances .: 45.25
<S> mousqueton took the place of the coachman , and drove standing , for reasons known to himself , like automedon of antiquity .: 75.96
<S> read that , said he , when i am gone , that you may not be witness of my anger . while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse , which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus , and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow .: 43.92
<S> you face the insinuations of the pelagians and the semi pelagians . but , my reverend replied aramis , a little amazed by the shower of arguments that poured upon his head .: 78.29
<S> i was taken to versailles ; for three months i struggled with death ; at last , as i seemed to cling to life , i was ordered to the south .: 44.90
<S> deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards , named comminges , made his appearance , with his clothes all torn , his face streaming with blood .: 77.90
<S> follow me , replied d artagnan .: 7.82
<S> but when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in the open plain , d artagnan , who was completely ignorant of what was going forward , thought it was time to demand an explanation .: 36.89
<S> these undertakings do not suit me , as you know , aramis . why ? because it is taking people unawares . really , athos , you would make a singular general .: 54.52
<S> bricconi ! muttered he .: 35.30
<S> hola , bazin !: 43.87
<S> and wherefore should they do so ?: 39.59
<S> the guards were under arms , and d artagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades .: 16.08
<S> meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on .: 48.74
<S> do you wish this frightful secret to remain with us ?: 29.97
<S> it is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow , said he ; i know and admire the corsican nature too well to fear you .: 77.44
<S> is it by permission that he remains there ? asked gondy .: 41.81
<S> it was there wilmore had first met him and fought against him ; and in that war zaccone had been taken prisoner , sent to england , and consigned to the hulks , whence he had escaped by swimming .: 74.13
<S> to call edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre ; to speak seemed like violating the silence of the tomb .: 161.00
<S> all this , set off by the presence of that excellent prince , who was so good natured , who invented so droll tricks against monsieur de chavigny and so fine jokes against mazarin , made for la ramee the approaching pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year .: 78.48
<S> remember to go to the count on the 26th may at seven o clock in the evening .: 34.62
<S> i will prevent you . 50127m and who are you , then , that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings ? who am i ? repeated monte cristo .: 59.46
<S> ah , continued caderousse , speaking in the highly colored language of the south , the world grows worse and worse .: 56.14
<S> the weather was magnificent , and the excursion a treat .: 80.58
<S> if an individual project gutenberg electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder , your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs 1.e.1 through 1.e.7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder .: 12.64
<S> let us set off . mousqueton , recognizing the voice of his master s friend , got up suddenly , and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated to himself illegally during the night .: 51.20
<S> he lives at the bedford tavern , greenhall street .: 136.61
<S> the jailer went out , and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers .: 26.26
<S> dante s seemed full of kindness .: 33.04
<S> at length d artagnan , in pursuing his researches , found near the wall a woman s torn glove .: 49.56
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> run !: 56.90
<S> the spectre of valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less .: 127.25
<S> by a sort of instinctive impulse , franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar .: 42.98
<S> we traversed greece , and arrived half dead at the imperial gates .: 83.52
<S> as to that , said aramis , we are witnesses .: 17.65
<S> dante s was about to speak ; but feeling himself urged forward , and having neither the power nor the intention to resist , he mounted the steps , and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes ; the two others took their places opposite , and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones .: 43.45
<S> and did you catch any of his words ? i did ; but they were uttered in the romaic dialect .: 40.17
<S> d artagnan translated this for the others .: 55.78
<S> you !: 25.27
<S> in fact , the minister , who , in the plenitude of his power , had been unable to unearth napoleon s secret , might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dante s and so lay bare the motives of villefort s plot .: 47.88
<S> the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones , and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster ; but it kept on in the middle of the road , and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror .: 65.91
<S> at your service , sir , he continued .: 11.42
<S> so , said the cardinal , in a tone that contrasted strongly with the severity of his words , you have constituted yourselves judges , without remembering that they who punish without license to punish are assassins ? monseigneur , i swear to you that i never for an instant had the intention of defending my head against you .: 48.21
<S> this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery , where patrols are continually passing , and sentries keep watch day and night . are you quite sure of that ? certain .: 116.50
<S> one of the noble peers , who was familiar with the arabic language , having studied it during the famous egyptian campaign , followed with his eye as the translator read aloud : i , el kobbir , a slave merchant , and purveyor of the harem of his highness , acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime emperor , from the french lord , the count of monte cristo , an emerald valued at eight hundred thousand francs ; as the ransom of a young christian slave of eleven years of age , named hayde e , the acknowledged daughter of the late lord ali tepelini , pasha of yanina , and of vasiliki , his favorite ; she having been sold to me seven years previously , with her mother , who had died on arriving at constantinople , by a french colonel in the service of the vizier ali tepelini , named fernand mondego .: 72.32
<S> porthos boasted of the strength of mousqueton , who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary size .: 85.04
<S> hearing the noise of the fight , resumed the duke , i fancied you had about twenty men with you , so i came back with those around me , tired of always running away , and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause ; but you are only two . yes , my lord ; but , as you have said , two that are a match for twenty , said athos .: 45.73
<S> we shall be murdered there , said aramis .: 25.41
<S> have you , then , madame , no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have vegetated in obscurity , without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you ?: 69.17
<S> the procureur , without going to see either his wife or his daughter , went at once to his study , and , offering the young man a chair : m .: 40.13
<S> the instant groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano .: 106.10
<S> yes , there are two hundred of them , and each of them will need two , which will make four hundred . but four hundred what ? listen ! cried d artagnan .: 31.07
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> planchet art thou there ? cried mousqueton , with open arms and eyes full of tears .: 85.69
<S> i swear , he said , with a calm brow and kindly glance , but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion , i swear that i no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends .: 43.70
<S> years have elapsed , many events have happened , alas !: 66.49
<S> morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only , and none of the banks would give him credit .: 132.96
<S> a poor officer , without fortune , without protection , without a future , unless the eye of my queen , which i have sought so long , rests on me for a moment .: 49.02
<S> pardon , my dear monsieur bonacieux , if i don t stand upon ceremony , said d artagnan , but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep .: 50.70
<S> and who told you i had no affair with a lover ? it is a man , then , who expects you ? cried d artagnan .: 25.04
<S> i always said that d artagnan had the longest head of the four , said athos , who , having uttered his opinion , to which d artagnan replied with a bow , immediately resumed his accustomed silence .: 39.35
<S> monte cristo ran down the steps , and advancing towards the spot designated beheld villefort , encircled by his servants , with a spade in his hand , and digging the earth with fury .: 35.07
<S> and did you go alone ? asked morrel , after he had read it .: 22.89
<S> yes , yes , continued he , twill be the same as it was in england .: 24.28
<S> edmond , it is not madame de morcerf who is come to you , it is merce de s. merce de s is dead , madame , said monte cristo ; i know no one now of that name . merce de s lives , sir , and she remembers , for she alone recognized you when she saw you , and even before she saw you , by your voice , edmond , by the simple sound of your voice ; and from that moment she has followed your steps , watched you , feared you , and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes m. de morcerf . fernand , do you mean ? replied monte cristo , with bitter irony ; since we are recalling names , let us remember them all . monte cristo had pronounced the name of fernand with such an expression of hatred that merce de s felt a thrill of horror run through every vein .: 41.05
<S> with you , d artagnan , with you , porthos all four reunited for the first time for twenty years we would dare not only england , but the three kingdoms put together ! and did you promise the queen , resumed d artagnan , petulantly , to storm the tower of london , to kill a hundred thousand soldiers , to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man , and when that man is cromwell ?: 51.59
<S> madame , the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road . in fact , the procession arrived , in safety at notre dame , at the front gate of which all the clergy , with the coadjutor at their head , awaited the king , the queen and the minister , for whose happy return they chanted a te deum .: 66.23
<S> the count of san felice announced a grand masked ball , to which all that were distinguished in rome were invited .: 55.71
<S> they returned to the hotel ; at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight .: 32.32
<S> if you prefer any other place , said athos , in his persuasive voice , choose for yourselves . this place , if monsieur d herblay can procure the key , is the best that we can have , was the answer .: 43.93
<S> de chevreuse and consequently the queen .: 36.99
<S> why should i obtain you by violence , if our love is mutual ?: 66.26
<S> madame danglars is ill , said villefort ; it would be better to take her to her carriage . oh , mon dieu ! said monte cristo , and i have forgotten my smelling bottle ! i have mine , said madame de villefort ; and she passed over to monte cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on edward .: 35.23
<S> those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups .: 291.85
<S> what do you mean ?: 5.22
<S> what will our two friends say ?: 53.47
<S> unhappy father , said monte cristo .: 33.93
<S> mademoiselle paulet has observed you , vicomte ; go and bow to her ; don t try to appear anything but what you are , a true country youth ; on no account speak to her of henry iv . when shall we two walk together ? athos then said to aramis .: 70.99
<S> aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious , it was better not to fathom them .: 95.03
<S> whom must i announce to my lord duke ? asked patrick .: 56.00
<S> i swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather .: 74.21
<S> if that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince .: 166.23
<S> de morcerf ! said baptistin , as if that name sufficed for his excuse .: 51.21
<S> a man arrived yesterday from yanina , bringing a formidable array of documents ; and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article , he told us it should be inserted in some other paper . beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit , and left the office to despatch a courier to morcerf .: 96.35
<S> i turned around , i looked at the trees , i tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time .: 28.31
<S> on what was d artagnan thinking , that he strayed thus from his path , gazing at the stars of heaven , and sometimes sighing , sometimes smiling ?: 93.33
<S> tis a very strong post , he resumed , and we have forty good men , tried soldiers , having no connection with frondeurs nor any interest in the fronde . if we put these three men together , monsieur comminges , said mazarin , we must double the guard , and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality . comminges smiled ; mazarin read and construed that smile .: 83.31
<S> i am a very capricious being , and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise , or after my dinner , or in the middle of the night , i resolve on starting for some particular point , and away i go . the count rang , and a footman appeared .: 46.88
<S> poet as i am , i am intimate with sarazin , who is devoted to the prince de conti , and with monsieur de bois robert , who , since the death of cardinal richelieu , is of all parties or any party ; so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me . i have no doubt of it , said d artagnan .: 37.22
<S> what say you ? i can not believe such was the case .: 21.57
<S> grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass , took the basket , packed up the viands , added the bottles , and then took the basket on his arm .: 37.36
<S> d artagnan and porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal .: 47.79
<S> are these persons , then , so rich and powerful ? do you not know their history ? i do not .: 33.45
<S> milady tried to raise and carry her , but could not do it .: 41.20
<S> although our friends were expecting that condemnation , it filled them with grief .: 127.24
<S> then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis , called olivain , the lackey who had followed him from blois , and made him pack the valise under his own eyes , watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign .: 44.90
<S> he felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed .: 149.78
<S> but go on signing , said monte cristo ; i perceive that my story has caused a general emotion , and i beg to apologize to you , baroness , and to mademoiselle danglars . the baroness , who had signed , returned the pen to the notary .: 30.98
<S> and knowing that real name , my lord , replied felton , will you sign it all the same ? doubtless , said buckingham , and rather twice than once . i can not believe , continued felton , in a voice that became more sharp and rough , that your grace knows that it is to milady de winter this relates . i know it perfectly , although i am astonished that you know it . and will your grace sign that order without remorse ? buckingham looked at the young man haughtily .: 53.92
<S> for you have here at least three men who will not betray you .: 40.62
<S> but the easy chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor , and he soon made his appearance in the room .: 35.35
<S> the burglary chapter 83 .: 33.65
<S> one moment , yes , answered the queen .: 17.86
<S> if i were i should do for you at once the most that you deserve .: 49.40
<S> well ? said the queen , blinded by her obstinacy .: 22.41
<S> i overcame every obstacle , and reached the goal ; but woe to those who stood in my pathway ! 50215m enough , said merce de s ; enough , edmond !: 77.41
<S> i implored heaven that he might come .: 88.70
<S> touching unanimity ! cried d artagnan , which well becomes good citizens like us .: 111.90
<S> enter , gentlemen , said laporte , since the queen desires you so to do . then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe .: 53.68
<S> but i am really glad to have seen such a sight ; and i understand what the count said that when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle , it is the only one that causes you any emotion . 20175m without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character , said the count ; on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life , and the real visage is disclosed .: 80.57
<S> then , having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own , he glanced towards the door .: 24.25
<S> i love my sister julie , i love her husband emmanuel ; but i require a strong mind to smile on my last moments .: 46.59
<S> there , crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat , they may be seen sometimes talking to one another , but more frequently alone , watching the door , which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage , or to throw in another outcast from society .: 89.50
<S> athos took a pistol from his belt , looked to see if it was properly primed , cocked it , and placed the muzzle close to grimaud s ear .: 28.87
<S> oh , more than i can say , kitty !: 24.21
<S> really , my dear count , said morcerf , what i admire in you is , not so much your riches , for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself , nor is it only your wit , for beaumarchais might have possessed as much , but it is your manner of being served , without any questions , in a moment , in a second ; it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing , and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness . what you say is perhaps true ; they know my habits .: 75.21
<S> besides , in addition to the pioneers , there are four soldiers and a brigadier , armed with muskets . that s because they don t see us , said athos .: 37.66
<S> dear me ! said the young woman , endeavoring to read her husband s inmost thoughts , while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of villefort ; what is the matter ? madame , where do you keep the poison you generally use ? said the magistrate , without any introduction , placing himself between his wife and the door .: 36.83
<S> in order , doubtless , that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission , the priest rose as soon as d avrigny departed , and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left , but also that leading to madame de villefort s room .: 48.38
<S> well , then , we will go into paris .: 11.41
<S> the gascon , therefore , instead of answering , growled out ja !: 35.02
<S> well , be it so , at length said euge nie ; return by the same road you came , and we will say nothing about you , unhappy wretch . here he is , here he is ! cried a voice from the landing ; here he is !: 34.32
<S> you are fernand mondego , the french officer who led the troops of my noble father !: 63.38
<S> a gentleman , and a diplomatist . then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman , and three for the diplomatist .: 41.02
<S> unfortunately , said monte cristo , one s title to a millionaire does not last for life , like that of baron , peer of france , or academician ; for example , the millionaires franck poulmann , of frankfurt , who have just become bankrupts . indeed ? said danglars , becoming pale .: 62.39
<S> ordinarily m. de villefort made and returned very few visits .: 146.62
<S> in an instant he was placed in the stern sheets of the boat , between the gendarmes , while the officer stationed himself at the bow ; a shove sent the boat adrift , and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the pilon .: 70.26
<S> milady recoiled , uttering a cry .: 30.02
<S> meanwhile , by a cleft between two walls of rock , following a path worn by a torrent , and which , in all human probability , human foot had never before trod , dante s approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed .: 90.48
<S> what do i say ?: 8.37
<S> around the schooner lay a number of small fishing boats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village , like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen .: 104.25
<S> he was therefore silent ; and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth , d artagnan s confidence stopped there .: 48.70
<S> i had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume .: 49.52
<S> athos , therefore , commanded bazin to fasten up his horse and that of aramis in the same manner .: 31.60
<S> he found edmond lying prone , bleeding , and almost senseless .: 66.70
<S> has such and such a perfume done anything for me ?: 197.73
<S> then tell me who you are , and get along with you upon your journey , replied the duchess , with the gayety which made her so charming , for i am sufficiently in bad odor already , without compromising myself still more . who i am , madame ?: 58.66
<S> yes , said the procureur , and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary , for i can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine , and she may , perhaps , be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather . no , no , no , replied the eye of the paralytic .: 45.85
<S> my friend , said beauchamp , in the most affectionate tone , i should gladly make an apology ; but , alas ! but what ? the paragraph was correct , my friend . what ?: 27.15
<S> d artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry .: 20.94
<S> god gave that spectre the form of the count of monte cristo when he at length issued from his tomb , enriched him with gold and diamonds , and led him to you ! ah , i recognize you i recognize you ! exclaimed the king s attorney ; you are i am edmond dante s ! you are edmond dante s , cried villefort , seizing the count by the wrist ; then come here ! and up the stairs he dragged monte cristo ; who , ignorant of what had happened , followed him in astonishment , foreseeing some new catastrophe .: 59.05
<S> now attach him to our party .: 87.20
<S> the young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor .: 33.79
<S> which is my best cavalry horse ? vulcan . and the best hack ? bayard . what horse dost thou choose for thyself ? i like rustaud , my lord ; a good animal , whose paces suit me . strong , thinkest thou ? half norman , half mecklenburger ; will go night and day . that will do for us .: 156.36
<S> the lion was daunted ; the avenger was conquered .: 55.83
<S> two of the men appeared , bearing the woman in their arms , and carried her to the carriage , into which the little old man got after her .: 31.91
<S> i sometimes dream , that s all .: 33.83
<S> the priest stole the sacred vases , and sold them ; but as they were preparing to escape together , they were both arrested .: 49.47
<S> who can answer for that ?: 42.28
<S> it was the will of god that this should happen , blessed be his name .: 56.97
<S> come in , exclaimed d artagnan ; and another servant entered .: 30.73
<S> he continued to follow the path to the glade ; but , to his great surprise , carlini arrived almost as soon as himself .: 40.03
<S> all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done ; in fact , all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond , which certainly did wear an air of improbability , appeared natural enough , and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust ; but , worn out as i was with fatigue , and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated , i determined to obtain a few hours sleep .: 88.78
<S> immediately m. de tre ville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis , who bore their comrade in their arms .: 28.38
<S> d artagnan set out with his four companions , and followed the trench ; the two guards marched abreast with him , and the two soldiers followed behind .: 22.87
<S> are you making a sketch after poussin ? oh , no , was the tranquil response ; i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort .: 73.09
<S> his musketeers proceeded and followed him .: 40.85
<S> so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs , muttered edmond .: 54.01
<S> precautions .: 105.72
<S> there s not a moment to lose ; now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel . but , asked the sailor , where are your companions ?: 40.55
<S> news in prison is a fruit so rare that i trust , monsieur de comminges , you will excuse my impatience the more eager since you have given us to understand that the news is good . should you be glad to hear that the comte de la fere is well ? asked de comminges .: 50.50
<S> they sailed ; edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth , and which he had so often dreamed of in prison .: 50.91
<S> my left side still pains me ! are you sure we are on the right track , lieutenant ? egad , didn t you hear ?: 60.98
<S> count , he inquired , have you any relations ? no , sir , i am alone in the world . so much the worse . why ? asked monte cristo .: 14.01
<S> my friend , said andrea , i have been dining at saint jean aux bois , and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight , but like a fool i have lost my way , and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest .: 42.84
<S> moreover , do not alarm yourself , morrel ; this weakness , if it is such , is betrayed to you alone .: 46.38
<S> as the door closed after them kitty rushed toward it .: 61.73
<S> for me ? cried the boy , his eyes sparkling with joy , if i can find out where bazin is going ?: 38.47
<S> they proceeded to the rue saint denis .: 10.51
<S> porthos had discovered the means , the diamond .: 55.00
<S> the evening of the betrothal chapter 10 .: 27.04
<S> yes , indeed ! cried d artagnan , who was afraid of disheartening his friend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about him ; yes , surely , he said he said ? resumed porthos .: 32.19
<S> this was a great affront to the king s army , and a great inconvenience to the cardinal , who had no longer , it is true , to embroil louis xiii .: 32.44
<S> in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries , two reports , fearfully distinct , followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all , froze me with terror .: 89.13
<S> we must not do so ? no . you do not sanction our project ? no . there is another way , said morrel .: 27.13
<S> nothing , therefore , was settled that day , as emery s head was not steady enough for business after such an occurrence .: 80.28
<S> the two friends having agreed to leave blaisois and grimaud at compiegne with the horses , resolved to take post horses ; and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to louvres .: 66.79
<S> they won t devour us all four , four lackeys , horses , arms , and all ! and besides , it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments , said porthos .: 38.12
<S> this house , isolated from the rest , had , besides the main entrance , another in the rue de ponthieu .: 46.59
<S> in crossing the principal street in derby the four friends perceived blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house .: 61.39
<S> he listened for any sound that might be audible , and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon , and strove to penetrate the darkness .: 31.42
<S> i have .: 31.40
<S> sire , said winter , who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up , we are ready . the king looked at the three gentlemen .: 63.57
<S> thou seest , simpleton , said d artagnan to his servant , that they wished no harm to us . but to whom , then ? i faith !: 34.22
<S> but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty .: 81.96
<S> now kiss me ; and you , too , charlotte .: 42.60
<S> speak , said athos .: 10.98
<S> where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend s heart and a king s life ?: 75.02
<S> yes , monsieur . afraid of being heard !: 31.30
<S> the perspiration poured forth upon the young man s brow , and he felt as if he should faint .: 16.39
<S> good , muttered mazarin , sitting down , we shall soon see something startling . the queen s eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away .: 44.74
<S> i don t suppose that our friend d artagnan has added any of his own to the amount . but , gentlemen , in all this , said d artagnan , we do not think of the queen .: 24.10
<S> his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to albert s grief stricken face , who approached also , followed by the other four young men .: 85.79
<S> i shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms !: 31.90
<S> but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything . milady made no reply , but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow , she burst into tears , and uttered heartbreaking sobs .: 33.03
<S> what would my good father say , who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal , if he knew i was in the society of such pagans ? we have no need , therefore , to say that d artagnan dared not join in the conversation , only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears , stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing ; and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions , he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking place .: 61.01
<S> the priest having all confidence in his guest , who , besides , was a nobleman , had left to him his house , his supper and his chamber .: 41.98

<S> so he was called the queen s invalid , with a pension of fifteen hundred francs .: 39.82
<S> it is a wretched , damp , nay , even horrible spot , more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those iron bars .: 76.71
<S> debray continued : when you receive this , you will no longer have a husband .: 41.06
<S> the father of m. de tre ville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of money a thing to which the be arnais was accustomed all his life , and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing , that is to say , with ready wit in default of money , we repeat , he authorized him , after the reduction of paris , to assume for his arms a golden lion passant upon gules , with the motto fidelis et fortis .: 86.70
<S> i have had ten or twelve sailors under me , and if you question them , they will tell you that they love and respect me , not as a father , for i am too young , but as an elder brother . but you may have excited jealousy .: 56.41
<S> all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty , and he went into his friend s chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening ; but he found athos quite himself again that is to say , the most shrewd and impenetrable of men .: 66.62
<S> as to aramis , he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir , an eating room , and a bedroom , which room , situated , as the others were , on the ground floor , looked out upon a little fresh green garden , shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors .: 46.61
<S> two of her companions were dressed , the one as a woman of nettuno , and the other as a woman of la riccia .: 33.39
<S> you make me young and happy again by it .: 54.22
<S> at length a fresh discharge was heard , and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends , and whistling sharply in their ears .: 46.47
<S> a king , said d artagnan ; it s a good omen , master groslow look out for the king . and in spite of his extraordinary self control there was a strange vibration in the gascon s voice which made his partner start .: 44.22
<S> however , she offered the cardinal laporte s place , which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other .: 49.04
<S> it was a movement of vengeance upon milady .: 20.30
<S> but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle . very well , said d artagnan , his eyes aflame , battle !: 35.81
<S> where can my eyes have been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon ? i was within two paces of you , monsieur , replied the procurator s wife ; but you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water . porthos pretended to be confused .: 35.75
<S> answer , sir , exclaimed he ; you have been asked politely , and every question is worth an answer . i suppose i am free to say or not to say who i am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me . it was with difficulty that de guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monk s bones .: 60.02
<S> you are right , sir , said raoul .: 6.13
<S> well , said porthos , i will run to the ho tel , and engage our comrades to hold themselves in readiness by eight o clock ; the rendezvous , the place du palais cardinal .: 32.27
<S> hayde e chapter 50 .: 37.00
<S> the chances of war , said athos , are many , but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of them . no , but we shall make use of them , said d artagnan .: 30.19
<S> a man , enveloped in a cloak , came out immediately , and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal ; after which he mounted his horse , and set off in the direction of surge res , which was likewise the way to paris .: 29.73
<S> god grant you as much !: 35.87
<S> he had reserved the house and half the garden , and building a wall between the garden and the workshops , had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden .: 57.03
<S> nevertheless , it seemed to him that athos was not in all respects sincere and frank .: 46.52
<S> now , nothing of the kind has happened . what then ? asked hermine , trembling violently .: 43.08
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> she had turned from the window , which remained open , and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling ; her words were rapid , incoherent , unintelligible , for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance .: 63.11
<S> now , as at the moment in which d artagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet , the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the be arnese pony , his two auditors laughed even louder than before , and he himself , though contrary to his custom , allowed a pale smile if i may be allowed to use such an expression to stray over his countenance .: 65.68
<S> the poor devil would eat nothing , from fear . it is incredible ! no , my dear fellow , it is not at all incredible .: 37.37
<S> athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me .: 71.72
<S> they will then fancy it is an ambuscade , they will deliberate ; and by the time they have found out the pleasantry , we shall be out of the range of their balls .: 37.31
<S> have you seen anything ? they asked .: 24.70
<S> many men might have been handsomer , but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant , if the expression may be used .: 74.00
<S> three times did the bell ring with a dull , heavy sound , seeming to participate , in the general sadness , before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door , which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard .: 75.51
<S> the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope , near san pierdarena , a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report .: 79.21
<S> in passing through the gate , the hilt of the lieutenant s sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak ; in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected on the shining metal .: 49.29
<S> the three friends for , as we have said , athos had sworn not to stir a foot to equip himself went out early in the morning , and returned late at night .: 59.50
<S> there is no word , though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart , that can express my gratitude .: 55.08
<S> he entered portsmouth about eight o clock in the morning .: 18.58
<S> you recollect perfectly all i have told you , do you not ? your eminence will judge : the ball of madame the constable ; the night at the louvre ; the evening at amiens ; the arrest of montague ; the letter of madame de chevreuse . that s it , said the cardinal , that s it .: 28.78
<S> you have your servant s clothes on you therefore keep a servant ; i have none , and am obliged to prepare my own meals .: 68.10
<S> well , i shall see .: 16.59
<S> i heard the door open and shut , and i remained overwhelmed , less , i confess it , by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged myself .: 56.53
<S> on our honor as gentlemen . then i may tell you all .: 60.35
<S> oh , no , dear count ! cried aramis , is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to ? what do you mean , aramis ? that the place royale is the termination to the main road to vendomois , and nothing else . what !: 27.41
<S> those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn , more striking , than the raging sea , rolling , with its deafening roar , its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon .: 91.62
<S> then they looked at one another .: 20.62
<S> i am not yet twenty one , and euge nie is only seventeen ; but the two months expire next week .: 48.65
<S> and you go into that house ? cried he briskly .: 37.37
<S> it is not god s will that they should be accomplished .: 39.66
<S> my wife and child shall escape from this gulf , carrying treasures with them ; she will live and may yet be happy , since her child , in whom all her love is centred , will be with her .: 82.09
<S> zounds , lieutenant ! said he ; you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions , particularly if my lord has authorized you to look into her bed . felton blushed .: 60.78
<S> you wish to destroy yourself , said the count ; you have written it . well , said morrel , changing his expression of calmness for one of violence well , and if i do intend to turn this pistol against myself , who shall prevent me who will dare prevent me ?: 42.84
<S> quick as a flash , he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair .: 21.46
<S> finally , at lilliers i lost all trace of her .: 115.78
<S> on hearing the sound of his footsteps , the two men threw themselves in each other s arms , and while they were in the midst of this embrace , the count entered .: 19.83
<S> a man was hidden in lafitte s banking house , behind one of the little arched windows which are placed above each desk ; he saw merce de s enter the diligence , and he also saw albert withdraw .: 76.01
<S> but we have not done with the thing yet . 0087m do you , indeed , think so ? inquired the marquise .: 48.37
<S> suddenly , about ten paces from them , a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at vampa .: 46.27
<S> a carriage awaited him at the door ; he got in , followed by two soldiers and the magistrate , and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles .: 34.09
<S> at the end of the jetty , his clothes richly laced with gold , glittering , as was customary with him , with diamonds and precious stones , his hat ornamented with a white feather which drooped upon his shoulder , buckingham was seen surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself .: 49.50
<S> the duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing , i know ; but , added he , seriously , you understand , it is on the king s service . at your command , lieutenant , replied the musketeer , who saw the business was a serious one .: 36.89
<S> the law chapter 100 .: 31.07
<S> then you can quit your house , leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure , and everyone s mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterestedness .: 73.41
<S> come , just acknowledge that i could , eh ? this address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand .: 51.55
<S> oh , it was a touching superstition , monsieur , and although i did not myself believe it , i would not for the world have destroyed my father s faith .: 40.16
<S> you will be deceived just the same , said athos , who was an optimist when things were concerned , and a pessimist when men were in question .: 73.86
<S> i should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant . and that is the very thing that alarms me , returned dante s .: 25.33
<S> the union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired .: 106.44
<S> this must be , then , an affair of importance ; and what is the most important affair to a woman of twenty five !: 31.74
<S> that s very kind of him . here , monsieur , said the cardinal to the young man .: 15.64
<S> philosophers may well say , and practical men will always support the opinion , that money mitigates many trials ; and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm , you ought to be very easily consoled you , the king of finance , the focus of immeasurable power . danglars looked at him askance , as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously .: 78.95
<S> the same day they came for me and took me to the bastile .: 23.77
<S> every evening , either in the antechamber , the corridor , or on the stairs , he met the pretty soubrette .: 29.02
<S> you will have to find the abbe busoni ; and abbe s who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare .: 104.18
<S> suddenly a man sprang out of the english ranks , fell upon athos , twined arms of steel around him , and tearing his sword from him , said in his ear : silence !: 61.42
<S> here is monsieur comminges , said d artagnan , returning to the cardinal .: 12.10
<S> yes , monseigneur , enemies against whom you owe me all your support , for i made them by serving your eminence . who are they ? replied the duke .: 45.22
<S> i love you so tenderly that i can not help being jealous , even of the past . a smile , which was indefinable , passed over the lips of the queen .: 35.33
<S> hayde e , whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage , like all unsophisticated natures , delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear .: 82.87
<S> the noise of the door did not awaken her , and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret .: 22.04
<S> the queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or three gentlemen , and among them the duc de chatillon , the brother of the nobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on account of madame de longueville , on the place royale .: 31.49
<S> as he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence , d artagnan went straight to the residence of athos .: 30.26
<S> i take charge of everything ; be easy . it appears , however , said lord de winter , if there are any measures to take against the countess , it concerns me ; she is my sister in law . and me , said athos , she is my wife ! d artagnan smiled for he understood that athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a secret .: 35.74
<S> i did not look on caderousse as a bad man , and i thought him incapable of committing a crime , or even a theft . that did more honor to your heart than to your experience , m. bertuccio .: 64.78
<S> if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook , complying with the trademark license is very easy .: 26.06
<S> they fell into the line of carriages .: 26.99
<S> the piercing eye of monte cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees , and was soon relieved from all anxiety , for seeing a shadow glide between the yew trees , monte cristo recognized him whom he sought .: 76.48
<S> whatever evils may befall you , they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality , that i solemnly promise you . la carconte muttered a few inarticulate words , then let her head again drop upon her knees , and went into a fit of ague , leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation , but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered .: 48.86
<S> no , replied the young man .: 5.45
<S> we have had a narrow escape . but , said valentine , timidly , does all the father s shame revert upon the son ?: 50.14
<S> i shall be happy to meet you again , sir . may the devil annihilate me if i return thy wish ! murmured d artagnan , smiling as he pronounced the imprecation ; i declare i feel quite ill after only being five minutes in the courtyard .: 55.24
<S> my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards ; i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within .: 79.51
<S> danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions , and who is rendered brave by fear .: 73.16
<S> milady , faltered d artagnan , and fainted a second time .: 24.42
<S> the answer known , he had yielded to albert s wish to be introduced to hayde e , and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali , and had not opposed hayde e s recital but having , doubtless , warned the young girl , in the few romaic words he spoke to her , not to implicate morcerf s father .: 55.21
<S> at the rue gue ne gaud she called a cab , and directed the driver to go to the rue de harlay .: 38.60
<S> there is a man after my own heart .: 24.41
<S> and it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be feared . i must have , said the duke , a proof of his connection with buckingham . a proof ? cried milady ; i will have ten . well , then , it becomes the simplest thing in the world ; get me that proof , and i will send him to the bastille . so far good , monseigneur ; but afterwards ? when once in the bastille , there is no afterward ! said the cardinal , in a low voice .: 37.42
<S> but the devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which he has fixed his garrison .: 54.79
<S> buckingham was their messiah .: 136.35
<S> oh , cried the inspector , who can live here ? a most dangerous conspirator , a man we are ordered to keep the most strict watch over , as he is daring and resolute . he is alone ? certainly . how long has he been there ? nearly a year . was he placed here when he first arrived ? no ; not until he attempted to kill the turnkey , who took his food to him . to kill the turnkey ? yes , the very one who is lighting us .: 57.58
<S> the tiger , whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood , needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach , and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim ; but man , on the contrary , loathes the idea of blood it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life ; his natural construction and physiological formation dante s was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind , or rather soul ; for there are two distinct sorts of ideas , those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart .: 88.24
<S> of course , said he ; of what else should i speak ? mr .: 35.90
<S> it followed that his hat was forever in his hand , which procured him some severe reprimands from d artagnan , who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence .: 52.88
<S> many small donations 1 to 5,000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs .: 53.71
<S> ah , why were you not there , gentlemen ?: 24.43
<S> felton ! cried she .: 24.26
<S> then , when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard , and was consequently relieved of doubts , he said : thanks , madame , thanks for your punctuality ; and he offered a chair to madame danglars , which she accepted , for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated .: 40.12
<S> three hundred pistoles . oh , plenty !: 34.50
<S> as he could not leave his chamber , it was necessary to charge us with this commission . and then ? instead of putting the letter in the post , which is never safe , i took advantage of the journey of one of my lads to paris , and ordered him to convey the letter to this duchess himself .: 35.67
<S> two months , said he .: 17.30
<S> certain dante s could not escape , the gendarmes released him .: 95.53
<S> well , my lord !: 6.97
<S> on a table in the next room were lighted candles , cards , two dice boxes , and dice .: 53.11
<S> the siege of la rochelle is about to be resumed , monseigneur .: 26.82
<S> with an instinctive hatred of matrimony , she suffered andrea s attentions in order to get rid of morcerf ; but when andrea urged his suit , she betrayed an entire dislike to him .: 69.38
<S> i have not seen such a one four times in my life .: 25.58
<S> absolution , father !: 82.99
<S> the solitary light burning at the catalans ; that first sight of the cha teau d if , which told him whither they were leading him ; the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard ; his despair when he found himself vanquished , and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead all these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality .: 94.87
<S> the devil take you , said aramis .: 11.14
<S> monte cristo was beginning to think , what he had not for a long time dared to believe , that there were two merce de s in the world , and he might yet be happy .: 31.13
<S> good ! he said , nothing , almost nothing scratches , nothing more ; two in the arm and one in the breast .: 81.59
<S> for instance , the former servingman of some brave gentleman , an enemy himself to mazarin , as every gentleman ought to be . hush !: 67.30
<S> my friend here , monsieur du vallon , shares my gratitude , for he was particularly hungry . and i am so still , said porthos bowing to harrison .: 43.91
<S> perhaps he can not reconcile himself to the french style of living , and might prefer something else . oh , no ; i have seen him eat of everything in italy ; no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening . and besides , said the countess , accustomed as he is to burning climates , possibly he does not feel the heat as we do . i do not think that , for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated , and asked why the venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows . in a word , said merce de s , it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended . and she left the room .: 40.96
<S> i now repeat that i was born at auteuil on the night of the 27th of september , 1817 , and that i am the son of the procureur , m. de villefort .: 16.59
<S> is he rich ? he s the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in london . and knows lansquenet ? adores it . basset ? his mania . biribi ? revels in it . good , said porthos ; we shall pass an agreeable evening . the more so , as it will be the prelude to a better . how so ? we invite him to play to night ; he has invited us in return to morrow .: 69.43
<S> it was a continual scratching , as if made by a huge claw , a powerful tooth , or some iron instrument attacking the stones .: 84.80
<S> as for grimaud , he seemed more sullen than ever .: 23.17
<S> monsieur , said d artagnan , you must excuse famished travelers .: 34.13
<S> wasn t i right to part with the horses ? madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt .: 38.02
<S> in truth , that italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest man . d artagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at half past nine o clock he entered the ante room .: 34.00
<S> what new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before god ? a mournful sob burst from villefort s heart ; he approached the doctor , and seizing his arm , valentine , said he , it is valentine s turn ! 40284m your daughter ! cried d avrigny with grief and surprise .: 40.70
<S> he will very probably come of his own accord , said morcerf .: 48.89
<S> pyramus and thisbe about two thirds of the way along the faubourg saint honore , and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood , where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction , extended a large garden , where the wide spreading chestnut trees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart , and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate , that dated from the time of louis xiii .: 83.56
<S> monsieur athos , do me , then , the honor to accompany me ; you and your two friends , and then i shall have an escort to excite envy in his majesty , if we should meet him . the three musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses .: 28.38
<S> he kept his word .: 21.58
<S> she listened at euge nie s door , and hearing no sound tried to enter , but the bolts were in place .: 46.79
<S> if this man should ever discover the names of the others , my master is lost . haste !: 49.92
<S> he inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor .: 57.36
<S> now , on taking prisoners , this morning , two frenchmen , who seemed to me of high birth in short , two knights of the garter i said to myself , my fortune is made .: 63.81
<S> sir , he said , are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter ?: 43.70
<S> you are now almost a man , since you have made your first passage of arms , and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me . never , sir , said raoul , as long as i possess the happiness of having you for a protector , shall i deem i have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me .: 48.69
<S> oh , no , sir , it was expressly forbidden ; but they eluded the vigilance of the guards , and made a passage from one dungeon to the other . and which of them made this passage ? oh , it must have been the young man , certainly , for he was strong and industrious , while the abbe was aged and weak ; besides , his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea . blind fools ! murmured the count .: 47.15
<S> then it was not in society that i met with mademoiselle or yourself , madame , or this charming little merry boy .: 78.83
<S> tell him that our conversation at the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by these four men ; tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safe conduct which he had given me ; tell him they warned lord de winter of my journey to england ; that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs ; tell him that among these four men two only are to be feared d artagnan and athos ; tell him that the third , aramis , is the lover of madame de chevreuse he may be left alone , we know his secret , and it may be useful ; as to the fourth , porthos , he is a fool , a simpleton , a blustering booby , not worth troubling himself about . but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle ? i thought so , too ; but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame the constable , and which she has had the imprudence to show me , leads me to believe that these four men , on the contrary , are on the road hither to take her away . the devil !: 55.12
<S> the queen was , as we have said , of great beauty .: 18.81
<S> they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound .: 62.11
<S> ho !: 16.63
<S> he rapidly devoured his food , and after waiting an hour , lest the jailer should change his mind and return , he removed his bed , took the handle of the saucepan , inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall , and employed it as a lever .: 49.13
<S> it yet stood , under the shade of the fine avenue of lime trees , which forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of marseilles , covered by an immense vine , which spreads its aged and blackened branches over the stone front , burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the south .: 78.95
<S> i will embrace your knees !: 50.99
<S> he was masked likewise ; but i knew his step , i knew his voice , i knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity .: 79.67
<S> d artagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road , followed by planchet at the same pace .: 30.56
<S> i want to know what crime i have committed to be tried ; and if i am guilty , to be shot ; if innocent , to be set at liberty . are you well fed ? said the inspector .: 34.82
<S> the circumstances that had hastened the return of d artagnan to paris were as follows : one evening , when mazarin , according to custom , went to visit the queen , in passing the guard chamber he heard loud voices ; wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing , he approached with his wonted wolf like step , pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink .: 80.57
<S> it was almost broad daylight .: 32.34
<S> all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science .: 67.74
<S> if you will help me to drag myself from under my horse i hope nothing need prevent us continuing our journey . monsieur d arminges and olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse .: 116.52
<S> d artagnan , when he gave way to his own feelings which were in accordance with those of the queen had accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have attempted .: 56.27
<S> and as i am a connoisseur in such things , having had a few of my own once , i estimated it at a thousand pistoles . i hope , said d artagnan , half dead with fright , you made no mention of my diamond ? on the contrary , my dear friend , this diamond became our only resource ; with it i might regain our horses and their harnesses , and even money to pay our expenses on the road . athos , you make me tremble ! cried d artagnan .: 38.84
<S> taste this , and the mines of peru , guzerat , and golconda are opened to you .: 81.31
<S> it is i , said d artagnan in a subdued voice , i , the comte de wardes . oh , my god , my god ! murmured kitty , he has not even waited for the hour he himself named ! well , said milady , in a trembling voice , why do you not enter ?: 19.04
<S> they went out .: 12.58
<S> but let us be quick the king may change his mind in an hour ; and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort l eve que or the bastille who has got out , than to keep a prisoner there who is in . m. de tre ville made his entrance triumphantly into the fort l eve que , whence he delivered the musketeer , whose peaceful indifference had not for a moment abandoned him .: 46.27
<S> she looked around for help , and would have gone down to her grandfather s room , but on the stairs she met m. de villefort , who took her arm and led her into the drawing room .: 16.71
<S> in one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your hands . while thus speaking athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken , on d artagnan s finger , the place of the queen s ring , carefully kept in a casket .: 81.44
<S> among worldly people manner is contagious .: 481.33
<S> d artagnan and porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses , but the cardinal shook his head .: 32.11
<S> we should command an annuity of 175,000 livres .: 58.41
<S> the curtain rose on the ballet , which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school , admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri , who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art one of those masterly productions of grace , method , and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet , from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary , are all engaged on the stage at the same time ; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude , or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement , that would lead you to suppose that but one mind , one act of volition , influenced the moving mass .: 97.66
<S> tell me about it , said the monk , who , sitting on the foot of the bed , began to be interested in a story so strangely introduced .: 35.71
<S> think well of your reply , for should your eminence be mistaken , there might ensue most grave results for all of us . along the wall , sir , said mazarin , there will be no danger of losing yourselves . the three friends hastened on , but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pace .: 69.73
<S> my lord , said raoul , blushing , might examine the spanish prisoner . have you a spanish prisoner ? cried the prince .: 27.24
<S> well , pray , is there anything to be so surprised at ? he said .: 40.29
<S> dante s raised his head and saw faria s eyes injected with blood .: 28.30
<S> his wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss , whence he awoke , bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen .: 55.14
<S> do not exaggerate your duty .: 47.41
<S> notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue ; the king then , was condemned in advance .: 88.29
<S> you are a great almsgiver , said the visitor , and although you are said to be rich , i will venture to offer you something for your poor people ; will you accept my offering ? i thank you , sir ; i am only jealous in one thing , and that is that the relief i give should be entirely from my own resources . however my resolution , sir , is unchangeable , but you have only to search for yourself and you will find , alas , but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence . the abbe once more bowed as he opened the door , the stranger bowed and took his leave , and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of m. de villefort .: 39.48
<S> this is why i wish to set out again as soon as possible . i will try to accompany you , said aramis , though i scarcely feel in a condition to mount on horseback .: 30.81
<S> well , said he in a voice perfectly calm , and no muscle of his countenance disturbed , well , my dear vampa , it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony . 20207m ground arms , exclaimed the chief , with an imperative sign of the hand , while with the other he took off his hat respectfully ; then , turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene , he said , your pardon , your excellency , but i was so far from expecting the honor of a visit , that i did not really recognize you . it seems that your memory is equally short in everything , vampa , said the count , and that not only do you forget people s faces , but also the conditions you make with them . what conditions have i forgotten , your excellency ? inquired the bandit , with the air of a man who , having committed an error , is anxious to repair it .: 39.67
<S> i seemed to be going mad .: 30.05
<S> d artagnan drew his sword , and sprang toward the door .: 7.88
<S> i did not observe it yesterday . it must be the fog rising from the river , said the king .: 28.41
<S> make inquiry . of whom ? how ? of what ? may not barrois , the old servant , have made a mistake , and have given madame de saint me ran a dose prepared for his master ? for my father ? yes . but how could a dose prepared for m. noirtier poison madame de saint me ran ? nothing is more simple .: 53.90
<S> yes , ali himself , my nubian mute , whom you saw , i think , at rome . certainly , said morcerf ; i recollect him perfectly .: 50.16
<S> the abbe d herblay .: 12.09
<S> which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones , replied the englishman .: 56.32
<S> athos , without saying anything , emptied his pockets , got together all his jewels , purses , aiguillettes , and gold chains , and offered them all to porthos ; but as to the sword , he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings .: 63.13
<S> it was thought rather dear , but people wanted to sleep , and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep ?: 83.52
<S> the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw , and having filled the chimney with them , set a light to it .: 61.44
<S> the doctors , anxious for my lungs , had prescribed the air of naples .: 86.80
<S> if i were betrayed as he was , i would console myself ; but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor , who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves , for my fortune is theirs before me they were nothing after me they will be nothing , and perish miserably from incapacity ineptitude !: 112.85
<S> planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her , and found him .: 46.55
<S> they descended into the plain by the ladder .: 34.75
<S> for the first three days i heard him walking about as usual , but , on the fourth i heard nothing .: 41.61
<S> by the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized planchet .: 31.75
<S> like women , not like queens . egad !: 87.08
<S> athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner , whilst d artagnan , ever cautious , remained on horseback , one hand upon his pistol , leaning forward watchfully .: 68.99
<S> i was brought here by night , so devil take me if i know where i am . well , said comminges , suppose one thing . i will suppose anything you please . suppose there were a window in this wall . well ? from that window you would see monsieur de la fere at his . the count , then , is in the chateau ? yes . for what reason ? the same as yourself . athos a prisoner ? you know well , replied de comminges , that there are no prisoners at rueil , because there is no prison . don t let us play upon words , sir .: 42.33
<S> i will profit by the advice . and now , added the queen , her voice broken by her emotion , have you any other question to ask me ? nothing , the cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory manner except to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions .: 45.98
<S> i made them one day to calculate the age of my father , that i might know whether i should find him still living , and that of merce de s , to know if i should find her still free .: 22.68
<S> stop , rascal ! cried d artagnan .: 11.64
<S> the soldier returned , and felton gave him back his weapon .: 38.40
<S> the king s procureur alone was deprived of his office , being suspected of royalism .: 61.74
<S> milady de boulogne , evening of the twenty fifth .: 120.24
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> during this storm , gondy , who had it in his power to make it most unpleasant for the jesters , remained calm and stern .: 49.08
<S> as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea , and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another , like cannon balls in an arsenal , with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices .: 51.07
<S> no , but in the one next to it , and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing .: 52.18
<S> god has preserved us hitherto , god will preserve us still . yes , we .: 102.54
<S> pray put no construction on my words i do not mean they should convey , and give them no undue weight . no . said albert , the engagement is broken off . well , said beauchamp .: 66.19
<S> but what must i do ? asked milady .: 8.67
<S> de guiche , who was young and impulsive , said to raoul , here we are , three masters and three servants .: 47.70
<S> then you hope ? said d avrigny , with surprise .: 18.41
<S> i was expected at sharp midnight , and i am late . by five minutes . yes ; but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages . when one loves . well !: 78.79
<S> we will keep on the frontiers , for instance ; and at the first alarm we can leave france . and what can we do there ? wait . but if they come ? my brother s carriage will be here first . if i should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for you at dinner or supper , for instance ? do one thing . what is that ? tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible , you ask her permission to share my repast . will she permit it ? what inconvenience can it be ? oh , delightful !: 53.23
<S> ah , pardieu ! continued he , if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours , and if it were against such people you require impunity monseigneur , replied milady , a fair exchange .: 40.17
<S> the four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house , which d artagnan occupied with authority .: 42.08
<S> those casks which i took for casks of port wine are filled with powder .: 122.25
<S> but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed : oh , grandpapa , i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me ; you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed . ah , yes , most assuredly , said the eyes of the paralytic , for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake .: 30.95
<S> volume three 30009m 30011m chapter 48 .: 168.44
<S> you can not be mistaken ; there is but one . afterward ? you will ask for the host , and will repeat to him the word forward ! which means ? in french , en avant .: 77.93
<S> they entered the roadstead ; but as they drew near in order to cast anchor , a little cutter , looking like a coastguard formidably armed , approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder .: 64.10
<S> the coachman went up the via di ripetta and the porta san paolo ; and when they were two hundred yards outside , as the frenchman became somewhat too forward , beppo put a brace of pistols to his head , the coachman pulled up and did the same .: 58.17
<S> then a voice reached them once more , sending this threat : to our next meeting , sirs , in england . chapter xliv .: 138.09
<S> the same evening the following was read in le messager : by telegraph .: 111.70
<S> to fall , continued king louis , who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended , to fall , and learn of that fall by telegraph !: 116.37
<S> it appears that after having challenged m. de monte cristo at the opera yesterday , he apologized on the ground today . impossible , said madame de villefort .: 36.53
<S> i pretended to pour out water from the jug , but i only drank that which i had saved in my glass .: 52.65
<S> now i understand , he said , why you had me brought here to this desolate spot , in the midst of the ocean , to this subterranean palace ; it was because you loved me , was it not , count ?: 30.74
<S> was there nothing to fear ?: 63.40
<S> this was the more so because bonacieux s reflections were all rose colored .: 97.89
<S> i reply , my lord , tis but little , as certainly i shall not go alone . i suppose not .: 36.01
<S> d artagnan returned and again attacked him .: 21.48
<S> i am monsieur du poins , an officer in the guards , on duty at the donjon of vincennes . mazarin , perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say , made a sign that d artagnan and porthos should give place .: 27.72
<S> pardon me , my friend , if i disturb you , said the man with the red handkerchief , but i want to speak to you . you have no right to beg at night , said the groom , endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder .: 28.16
<S> here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold ; make all your arrangements , and tell me where i shall be able to find you this evening at ten o clock . it must be on some elevated place , whence a given signal may be seen in every part of paris . shall i give you a line for the vicar of st. jacques de la boucherie ?: 34.15
<S> in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground .: 68.67
<S> oh , sir , she said ; oh , sir , what a misfortune !: 13.84
<S> excuse me , said the banker , but you will tire yourself , baroness , by such late hours , and m. debray lives some distance from here . debray was petrified , not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely , but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do .: 155.14
<S> my poor brother was ignorant of this sentence .: 36.34
<S> tonight , after twelve , i will come and see you , and you shall convince me . no , felton , no , my brother , said she ; the sacrifice is too great , and i feel what it must cost you .: 27.32
<S> cha teau renaud , who has lived in russia , will tell you the name of one , and major cavalcanti , who is an italian , will tell you the name of the other . this one is , i think , a sterlet , said cha teau renaud .: 24.56
<S> if we are attacked , we will defend ourselves ; if we are tried , we will stoutly maintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of times in the sea .: 51.17
<S> this time d artagnan was not hasty .: 17.09
<S> but , said grimaud , in the same silent dialect , we shall leave our skins there . athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven .: 36.55
<S> who is this young person , m. de morcerf ? inquired euge nie ; does anybody know ? mademoiselle , said albert , replying to this direct appeal , i can give you very exact information on that subject , as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing the young woman is a greek . so i should suppose by her dress ; if you know no more than that , everyone here is as well informed as yourself . i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone , replied morcerf , but i am reluctantly obliged to confess , i have nothing further to communicate yes , stay , i do know one thing more , namely , that she is a musician , for one day when i chanced to be breakfasting with the count , i heard the sound of a guzla it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own . then your count entertains visitors , does he ? asked madame danglars .: 54.00
<S> this is not the way that i wished to avenge myself , said milady , replacing the glass upon the table , with an infernal smile , but , my faith !: 26.33
<S> as to the monk , without withdrawing the poniard from the wound , he ran to the window , opened it , leaped out into the flowers of a small garden , glided onward to the stable , took out his mule , went out by a back gate , ran to a neighbouring thicket , threw off his monkish garb , took from his valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier , clothed himself in it , went on foot to the first post , secured there a horse and continued with a loose rein his journey to paris .: 50.58
<S> then , while madame de saint me ran remained on her knees , praying fervently , villefort sent for a cab , and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from madame de morcerf s .: 33.71
<S> albert entered , looking very handsome and in high spirits .: 61.92
<S> and i , also , said d artagnan , i also .: 17.25
<S> silence , d herblay ! cried athos ; such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these .: 46.10
<S> you understand , dante s relations , if he had any , might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive . so that now , if there were anything to inherit from him , they may do so with easy conscience .: 56.80
<S> i have the greatest veneration for the cardinal , continued he , and the most profound respect for his actions .: 20.74
<S> that we may be more at our ease , la ramee removes the guards , keeping only grimaud to wait on us .: 78.55
<S> i went too ; but as i was older than fernand , and had just married my poor wife , i was only sent to the coast .: 38.14
<S> oh , my god ! cried anne of austria , with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell .: 27.51
<S> you have insulted a defenseless man .: 41.07
<S> these were the reasons which , added to the fatigue , caused andrea to sleep so soundly .: 86.25
<S> did i tell you that i wouldn t serve any other ?: 30.78
<S> dante s had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates , who are hung up to the yard arm ; he would not die by what seemed an infamous death .: 80.55
<S> this chamber was a sort of garret , situated in the rue des fossoyeurs , near the luxembourg .: 15.20
<S> yes , my lord . well enough to question him in that language ? yes , my lord . question him , then . raoul began the examination , but the result justified his opinion .: 40.30
<S> my dear athos , cried aramis , i think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lesson god forgive me ! wait a little , aramis ; it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have paid our visit to the coadjutor . let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace , said aramis .: 31.65
<S> alas , said valentine , restraining her tears , my grandfather is dead . m .: 18.70
<S> look at the writing , and find if you can , any blemish in the language or orthography . the writing was , in reality , charming , and the orthography irreproachable .: 67.86
<S> i had acted hastily towards him .: 31.88
<S> he was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms .: 43.74
<S> ah , pardieu ! said he , rising , you come in the nick of time , gentlemen .: 19.98
<S> come , four ?: 76.51
<S> i have hung up my sword , and cast myself into politics .: 41.79
<S> go , said he , in a subdued voice , and find rochefort .: 19.35
<S> it is a charming place , well supplied with spring water and fine trees ; a comfortable habitation , although abandoned for a long time , without reckoning the furniture , which , although old , is yet valuable , now that old things are so much sought after .: 73.40
<S> her ladies that is to say madame de bregy , mademoiselle de beaumont , madame de motteville , and socratine , her sister , so called on account of her sense had just brought into her dressing room the remains of the dinner , on which , according to her usual custom , she supped .: 48.35
<S> if the king was still irritated against them , they would depart without being seen ; if the king consented to see them , they would only have to be called .: 42.62
<S> sir !: 23.97
<S> he would have written or at this instant someone knocked at the door .: 43.54
<S> nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states .: 25.45
<S> and they went out together .: 20.70
<S> look at my hat and cloak . and d artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver .: 85.74
<S> for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs , exclamations , and prayers .: 38.58
<S> unfortunately , he is more nimble than his master ; so that for the sake of his master , he puts us all under his feet , and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for , he takes all he wants without asking at all . the fact is , said d artagnan , i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton . that is possible , monsieur ; but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact , even four times a year , with such intelligence and devotedness why , i should be a ruined man ! no , for porthos will pay you . hum ! said the host , in a doubtful tone .: 41.14
<S> besides , your own fortune , as your father assured me , is almost equal to that of your betrothed .: 32.87
<S> is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself ? yes , miserable wretch ! cried morcerf , it is your fault . danglars retreated a few steps .: 27.55
<S> monsieur de beaufort sent his cavalry , toward etampes and monsieur de chanleu , who defended the place , was ready to resist an assault , or if the enemy were repulsed , to attempt a sortie .: 71.44
<S> the spaniards ! that cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation .: 95.28
<S> if we were not forced to entertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with us , we should never dream of dining at home , i assure you . well , take another glass of sherry and another biscuit . willingly .: 68.62
<S> perhaps some of these days i may be entrapped , like poor peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net , and so help me out of prison . briefly , what did you learn ? that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two o clock , as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals .: 76.54
<S> valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer .: 21.01
<S> see , the prince is pluming himself , said one of the thieves .: 34.27
<S> standing before the chimney was a man of middle height , of a haughty , proud mien ; with piercing eyes , a large brow , and a thin face , which was made still longer by a royal or imperial , as it is now called , surmounted by a pair of mustaches .: 65.30
<S> this time he was both seen and heard , and the tartan instantly steered towards him .: 35.72
<S> my god , my dear host , tell me if anything has happened to him ? your lordship must have observed that he could not continue his journey . why , to be sure , he promised to rejoin us , and we have seen nothing of him . he has done us the honor to remain here . what , he had done you the honor to remain here ? yes , monsieur , in this house ; and we are even a little uneasy on what account ? of certain expenses he has contracted . well , but whatever expenses he may have incurred , i am sure he is in a condition to pay them . ah , monsieur , you infuse genuine balm into my blood .: 39.07
<S> ah , there he is calling me now .: 28.69
<S> three days since you were with him in normandy ; only three days since we looked on him as our best friend . an ironical smile passed over albert s lips .: 51.53
<S> his majesty king louis xiii .: 40.09
<S> from this phrase , d artagnan awakened planchet , the reader must not suppose it was night , or that day was hardly come .: 76.70
<S> i sounded all the walls , in the hopes of discovering a door , but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound .: 95.34
<S> the following day , about three o clock , a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count .: 28.12
<S> carlini returned , anxious to see his mistress , and announce the joyful intelligence .: 60.08
<S> monte cristo observed it particularly , and by a look asked the banker for an explanation .: 64.32
<S> there were sentinels , a guard in the court , stacks of arms , and horses saddled .: 39.64
<S> another ? and a magnificent one ! cried the host .: 42.63
<S> what will they leave him ?: 28.49
<S> bonacieux made no reply ; but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes .: 58.00
<S> when i look at you parisians , idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne , and think of this man , it seems to me we are not of the same race . i am highly flattered , returned beauchamp .: 32.36
<S> that i believe ! answered m. morrel ; but still he is charged with what ? inquired the elder dante s .: 43.77
<S> grimaud nodded assent .: 193.67
<S> he saw that it was a merciless war between us a war to the death .: 52.10
<S> are we not two despairing creatures ?: 56.68
<S> i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance . ah ! exclaimed de guiche , you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers , who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from heaven on them ; they are mostly foreigners scotch , irish or danish .: 85.34
<S> at length i saw the lamp rise softly , and disappear in the depths of the ceiling ; my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity , but i made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity .: 32.21
<S> monsieur grimaud he told us his name , although he does not talk much monsieur grimaud , then , went down to the cellar , wounded as he was ; then his master , having admitted him , barricaded the door afresh , and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar . but where is athos now ? cried d artagnan .: 46.75
<S> oh , save me ! a pen , a pen ! said the doctor .: 26.17
<S> royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the address specified in section 4 , information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation . you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing or by e mail within 30 days of receipt that s he does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg license .: 21.93
<S> moral wounds have this peculiarity , they may be hidden , but they never close ; always painful , always ready to bleed when touched , they remain fresh and open in the heart .: 200.79
<S> he questioned her with his eyes , but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look .: 26.75
<S> listen !: 37.45
<S> then added in a low whisper , you understand that , on account of your uncle , m. policar morrel , who served under the other government , and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject , you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of napoleon .: 45.13
<S> d artagnan cast an inquiring glance at milady .: 13.49
<S> you mean that this demands explanation , do you not ? i admit it . well , this is what actually took place : one evening after an orgy in reinard s apartment at the tuileries with the duc d harcourt , fontrailles , de rieux and others , the duc d harcourt proposed that we should go and pull cloaks on the pont neuf ; that is , you know , a diversion which the duc d orleans made quite the fashion . were you crazy , rochefort ?: 59.86
<S> and according to his custom d artagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that mazarin had a sealed letter before him .: 53.20
<S> they set out .: 17.50
<S> all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten , returned ; he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him , and discovered a new meaning in every word ; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words , until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven !: 104.61
<S> do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion ?: 70.65
<S> these important advantages d artagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the roe .: 42.49
<S> and as , continued he , the duchess whom you saw at the church has estates near to those of my family , we mean to make the journey together .: 67.53
<S> she had the less motive to resist , resistance would make so much noise .: 84.70
<S> has anyone been speaking to you against me ? yes , said the old man s look , with eagerness .: 25.99
<S> the marshal then entered the rue saint honore , but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of saint eustache .: 31.68
<S> this rabbit dead , the abbe adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill ; on this dunghill is a hen , who , pecking these intestines , is in her turn taken ill , and dies next day .: 131.82
<S> ah , good evening , my dear m. caderousse , said monte cristo ; what are you doing here , at such an hour ? 40156m the abbe busoni ! exclaimed caderousse ; and , not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors , he let fall his bunch of keys , and remained motionless and stupefied .: 28.43
<S> he resembles the old conventionalist of 93 , who said to napoleon , in 1814 , you bend because your empire is a young stem , weakened by rapid growth .: 103.49
<S> now you talk , my dear . you pardon me ? we shall see , said porthos , majestically ; and the two separated saying , till this evening . the devil ! thought porthos , as he walked away , it appears i am getting nearer to monsieur coquenard s strongbox at last . chapter xxxv .: 46.54
<S> everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle .: 71.22
<S> d artagnan and planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five hundred paces .: 16.99
<S> he stooped , and with the most gracious air he could assume , drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it , and holding it out to him , said , i believe , monsieur , that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose ? the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered , and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners .: 49.05
<S> the young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the pont neuf , opposite the samaritaine . a singular introduction ! you will find that it is as good as another . patrick galloped off , reached the duke , and announced to him in the terms directed that a messenger awaited him .: 58.38
<S> it appears to me that this cavalier has made you very angry .: 24.74
<S> do you think , she said , with a ghastly smile , that i shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations ? mazarin , overcome by this determination , read the two letters .: 54.62
<S> bless me , murmured baron danglars , this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency , and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre .: 87.04
<S> presently the army came in sight of lens ; two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault .: 77.06
<S> but that same night , he found himself the possessor of a fine house , situated on the boulevard de la madeleine , and an income of 50,000 livres .: 24.25
<S> then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him .: 25.45
<S> can tre ville have set this gascon upon me ?: 111.78
<S> besides , to tell truth , whilst d artagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of aramis or the vanity of porthos , he was ashamed to equivocate with athos , true hearted , open athos .: 111.39
<S> what is that line ?: 27.05
<S> athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising , with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around : i , the comte de la fere , a gentleman who has never deceived any human being , swear before god and before this unhappy queen , that all that was possible to save the king of england was done whilst we were on english ground .: 86.03
<S> speak , doctor i am listening , said villefort ; strike i am prepared for everything ! madame de saint me ran was , doubtless , advancing in years , but she enjoyed excellent health . morrel began again to breathe freely , which he had not done during the last ten minutes .: 62.43
<S> his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one .: 68.21
<S> oh , my god , my god ! cried milady ; when i supplicate thee to pour upon this man the chastisement which is his due , thou knowest it is not my own vengeance i pursue , but the deliverance of a whole nation that i implore ! do you know him , then ? asked felton .: 40.31
<S> the queen saving monsieur de buckingham , her lover ; nothing more just .: 53.36
<S> take my advice and set out this evening . impossible , monsieur . you have given your word , then ? yes , monsieur . ah , that s quite another thing ; but promise me , if you should not be killed tonight , that you will go tomorrow . i promise it . do you need money ? i have still fifty pistoles .: 25.23
<S> if she had been a great lady she would have fainted ; but as she was only a procurator s wife , she contented herself saying to the musketeer with concentrated fury , eh , monsieur porthos , you don t offer me any holy water ? porthos , at the sound of that voice , started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years .: 45.29
<S> have my valise carried to the muid d amour , rue des bourdonnais .: 80.91
<S> a wax light placed on the mantle piece threw some of its pale rays without , and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony .: 87.84
<S> send away that fellow , raoul , said the gascon ; for if he s a coward he will disgrace thee some day . monsieur says i am coward , cried olivain , because he wanted the other day to fight a cornet in grammont s regiment and i refused to accompany him . monsieur olivain , a lackey ought never to disobey , said d artagnan , sternly ; then taking him aside , he whispered to him : thou hast done right ; thy master was in the wrong ; here s a crown for thee , but should he ever be insulted and thou dost not let thyself be cut in quarters for him , i will cut out thy tongue .: 65.29
<S> at length the shutter closed .: 25.00
<S> morrel bent his head till it touched the stone , then clutching the grating with both hands , he murmured : oh , valentine ! the count s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words ; he stepped forward , and touching the young man s shoulder , said : i was looking for you , my friend . monte cristo expected a burst of passion , but he was deceived , for morrel turning round , said calmly , you see i was praying . the scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot .: 38.26
<S> in this case he was not the judge , but the executioner .: 23.83
<S> besides , he doesn t know you ; like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our plan . very well ; let us go . they then went down to the thames .: 40.67
<S> but when the cardinal added that not only mme .: 48.00
<S> yes , madame ; only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit .: 63.75
<S> i know , because it is my office to know everything .: 31.79
<S> to give them the order to charge , and run down these miserable rebels . and the king , putting spurs to his horse , set off to the tent of lord leven .: 53.53
<S> we bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor .: 181.98
<S> the air was soft and clear , as it generally is at that early hour of the morning .: 39.13
<S> what ? attempt to murder me in my father s house , in my room , on my bed of sickness ?: 43.62
<S> he picked up the paper , and , recognizing his wife s writing , ran his eyes rapidly over its contents ; it ran as follows : you know that i was a good mother , since it was for my son s sake i became criminal .: 34.10
<S> d artagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger ; with dilated eyes , growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servant s offices .: 55.64
<S> eh ?: 58.00
<S> i know that i suffer , that s all .: 16.45
<S> cardinal mazarin ? said he .: 30.22
<S> she was lost in reverie , and the reverie of crime is remorse .: 53.51
<S> the procureur felt more at ease , although he had learned nothing really satisfactory , and , for the first time since the dinner party at auteuil , he slept soundly .: 45.23
<S> apropos , when do you aspect m. d e pinay ? five or six days hence at the latest . and when is he to be married ? immediately on the arrival of m. and madame de saint me ran . bring him to see me .: 36.65
<S> it was time ; for they had scarcely sailed half a league , when d artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation .: 43.93
<S> unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg : 1.e.1 .: 28.93
<S> ah , my mother , my poor mother ! said albert , gazing through his tears at his mother s portrait ; if you know this , how much must you suffer ! come , said beauchamp , taking both his hands , take courage , my friend . but how came that first note to be inserted in your journal ?: 38.82
<S> as she uttered that bon mot , she arose and asked for her carriage .: 62.99
<S> you don t like playing , then ? on the contrary , i do . lansquenet , for instance ? devoted to it .: 35.08
<S> stop , said selim , seeing that she was about to go out ; you see i have not yet received the ring , true , said my mother .: 37.24
<S> he likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty little mme .: 75.40
<S> give me anything you like , it is of little consequence . go and fetch lord de winter , said felton , tired of these eternal complaints .: 62.21
<S> at half past seven the retreat was sounded .: 36.00
<S> grimaud , my friend , said the viscount , will you leave me thus , in such anxiety ?: 24.06
<S> well , within a week i am to deposit four millions for my share ; the four millions , i promise you , will produce ten or twelve . but during my visit to you the day before yesterday , sir , which you appear to recollect so well , replied euge nie , i saw you arranging a deposit is not that the term ? of five millions and a half ; you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury , and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning . yes , but those five millions and a half are not mine , and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me ; my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions , and the five millions and a half belong to them ; at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them , but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known , and , as i told you , my credit is rather shaken .: 67.39
<S> let us see . i have told you .: 15.25
<S> he was , perhaps , about to regain his liberty ; at the worst , he would have a companion , and captivity that is shared is but half captivity .: 61.41
<S> he let off his fire at but four paces .: 99.85
<S> i have made an agreement with the navy , that the access to my island shall be free of all charge .: 58.67
<S> but bear in mind , that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government , you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment , as it is known you belong to a suspected family . alas , madame , returned villefort , my profession , as well as the times in which we live , compels me to be severe .: 68.36
<S> still , let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence , the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits , and the daily infliction of his peevish partner s murmurs and lamentations .: 105.79
<S> monsieur d artagnan , monsieur du vallon , you are free . the order was obeyed ; d artagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle .: 17.06
<S> come , let us talk a little about my father . who , then , am i ? you , sir ? you are my adopted father .: 30.10
<S> aramis , porthos and d artagnan drew their chairs near him .: 20.06
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> d artagnan sprang up with a bound , and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground .: 28.07
<S> the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm ; you may depend upon it , he will repay you by some ill turn . but of what sort ? eh !: 45.46
<S> i go to morrow , my friend , replied d artagnan .: 8.89
<S> well , when i was a clerk , morcerf was a mere fisherman . and then he was called fernand . only fernand ? fernand mondego . you are sure ? pardieu ! i have bought enough fish of him to know his name . then , why did you think of giving your daughter to him ? because fernand and danglars , being both parvenus , both having become noble , both rich , are about equal in worth , excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me . what ? oh , nothing ! ah , yes ; what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of fernand mondego .: 66.54
<S> meanwhile , valentine , while reproaching me with selfishness , think a little what you have been to me the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble venus .: 79.31
<S> he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand , touched a spring , and immediately a pale light , just bright enough to render objects distinct , was reflected on his hands and countenance .: 64.75
<S> and i shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts . do not be unhappy , dear friend , on that account ; if you have done nothing as yet , you will do something soon , replied athos .: 33.92
<S> down with him ! was the cry .: 67.36
<S> follow you ! cried bonacieux , follow you at this hour !: 37.27
<S> this timidity , which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt , conciliated some in his favor ; for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred .: 80.75
<S> really ? asked athos .: 13.67
<S> these two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with spain , the quarrel with england , or the embarrassment of the finances .: 73.24
<S> a summer ball chapter 69 .: 64.14
<S> we must , then , as it appears to me , travel in company .: 29.22
<S> che cosa ? asked the bandit .: 64.98
<S> ah , sir , said he , tell me what is the matter with me .: 8.59
<S> i know nearly one thousand words , which is all that is absolutely necessary , although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries .: 42.64
<S> the queen bent over him and kissed his brow .: 17.42
<S> we were merely joking ; drink to his health , he added , filling caderousse s glass , and do not interfere with us . yes , yes , dante s good health ! said caderousse , emptying his glass , here s to his health !: 34.99
<S> after that she plunged into the cabal headed by the duke of beaufort ; and the coxcomb arrested de beaufort and banished madame de chevreuse . you know , resumed d artagnan , that she has had leave to return to france ? yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another . oh , but this time perhaps she will follow your advice . oh , this time , returned aramis , i haven t seen her ; she is much changed . in that respect unlike you , my dear aramis , for you are still the same ; you have still your beautiful dark hair , still your elegant figure , still your feminine hands , which are admirably suited to a prelate . yes , replied aramis , i am extremely careful of my appearance .: 59.11
<S> perfectly , said the dragoon .: 38.01
<S> you can not condemn me ! i offered you tyburn , said lord de winter .: 21.69
<S> they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house .: 61.39
<S> has it ever happened to you ? said monte cristo .: 11.64
<S> nay , madame , i pray you pardon this little traitor .: 34.36
<S> let us speak frankly , continued louvieres , and act in a straightforward manner .: 34.54
<S> but i love her , my lord , and was jealous .: 22.45
<S> i tell you to hope .: 24.35
<S> and what guarantee will you give me , asked she , if i consent to confide this message to you ? my love for you .: 47.38
<S> well , i , who am a bonapartist also , declare one thing to you , which is , that i will kill you .: 32.29
<S> scarron was heated , the cold seized on him , and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled .: 66.20
<S> excellent ; there is port wine in the cellar of monsieur le baron de bracieux . suppose we ask these englishmen to sell us a bottle , said the honest blaisois .: 75.55
<S> do you preach them ? no ; i sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators . ah , indeed !: 62.63
<S> well , the poison brings on a cough , the cough an inflammation of the lungs , or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science , which , however , by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal ; and if it were not , would be sure to become so , thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors , who are generally bad chemists , and which will act in favor of or against the malady , as you please ; and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill , and of whom justice learns nothing , as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance , the worthy abbe adelmonte of taormina , in sicily , who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly . it is quite frightful , but deeply interesting , said the young lady , motionless with attention .: 81.27
<S> at first the captain had received dante s on board with a certain degree of distrust .: 32.48
<S> shall i see you again ? asked the countess .: 9.43
<S> seeing , however , no one there except a musketeer of his own troop , he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier , in whose dress , nevertheless , he recognized at the first glance the cardinal .: 52.99
<S> why , your prote ge , m. andrea cavalcanti ! ah , no joking , viscount , if you please ; i do not patronize m. andrea at least , not as concerns m. danglars . and you would be to blame for not assisting him , if the young man really needed your help in that quarter , but , happily for me , he can dispense with it . what , do you think he is paying his addresses ? i am certain of it ; his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions .: 61.23
<S> she saw vaguely the future ; but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas , as yet confused , a distinct form and a regular plan .: 110.45
<S> d artagnan smiled ; this jealous anger of milady was his revenge .: 62.23
<S> my friend , continued morrel , you named the fifth of october as the end of the period of waiting , today is the fifth of october , he took out his watch , it is now nine o clock , i have yet three hours to live . be it so , said the count , come . morrel mechanically followed the count , and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it .: 32.67
<S> in the meantime there is bread , water , and fresh straw ; and that is all a prisoner can wish for .: 56.19
<S> this petition to napoleon , kept back by villefort , had become , under the second restoration , a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the king s attorney .: 43.89
<S> do you wish to see the powder room ? no .: 21.45
<S> his conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery , and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal .: 76.78
<S> silence prevailed for an instant , during which monte cristo gazed intently on the picture .: 35.68
<S> lord de winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who , a minute before , prepared apparently for a fight .: 90.35
<S> but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again ? ah , you are only one and twenty , and can forget the past ; i am fifty , and am obliged to recollect it .: 38.05
<S> m. de tre ville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette , when he felt the hand of athos , who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain , at length overcome by it , fell upon the floor as if he were dead .: 39.35
<S> noirtier watched her with evident anguish .: 39.96
<S> delirium , he repeated ; delirium , do you say ?: 43.13
<S> scarcely had he turned the corner of the rue de la juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent .: 38.58
<S> i believe , while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven , my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saint germain .: 69.77
<S> what do you mean to say ? i mean to say that i have a good reason , but that it is difficult to explain . you must be aware , at all events , that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me ; but one thing at least is clear , which is , that you decline allying yourself with my family . no , sir , said danglars ; i merely suspend my decision , that is all . and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices , and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces ? then , count , if you will not wait , we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained . the count bit his lips till the blood almost started , to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain ; understanding , however , that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him , he turned from the door , towards which he had been directing his steps , and again confronted the banker .: 50.72
<S> ah , said morcerf , there goes a happy man ! and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion .: 40.96
<S> go ! the count signified his intention of dining alone , and that no one but ali should attend him .: 51.83
<S> i like everyone . and you include me in the expression everyone many thanks ! let us not mistake , said monte cristo ; i love everyone as god commands us to love our neighbor , as christians ; but i thoroughly hate but a few .: 102.28
<S> there was a moment of silence ; but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back , and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar , and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall .: 43.39
<S> the young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed , and then turned again to the owner .: 50.90
<S> so in twelve times you thrice missed the mark . which you , sir , struck twelve times , answered raoul , smiling .: 93.39
<S> perhaps not so great as you think , porthos ; you know the proverb , all roads lead to rome . but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis ? asked porthos .: 61.86
<S> d avrigny put his hand to his heart , and placed a glass before his lips .: 15.15
<S> athos and aramis placed themselves behind him .: 11.95
<S> be reasonable .: 91.26
<S> his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo , but the second was for andrea .: 45.54
<S> what more is to be done ? i will do whatever is necessary . this assurance delighted morrel , who took leave of villefort , and hastened to announce to old dante s that he would soon see his son .: 46.40
<S> yes , said milady , lord de winter ; and now you can understand it all , can you not ?: 18.15
<S> come , come , we must be off .: 13.03
<S> take twenty five of them , aramis , and give me the remaining twenty five . all right ; i am glad to see you are of my opinion .: 27.81
<S> for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party , and she whispered her expectations to her daughter , that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them .: 42.68
<S> barrois , therefore , as we have seen , watched for valentine , and informed her of her grandfather s wish .: 24.77
<S> in short , at the moment in which she has just obtained from richelieu a carte blanche by the means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy , this precious paper is torn from her hands , and it is d artagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy botany bay , some infamous tyburn of the indian ocean .: 59.35
<S> but yet , continued the king , undoubtedly my haste accuses you wrongfully ; without doubt the rioters are in prison , and you come to tell me justice is done . sire , replied m. de tre ville , calmly , on the contrary , i come to demand it of you . and against whom ? cried the king .: 33.92
<S> i asked you , continued villefort , in a perfectly calm tone , where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my father in law , m. de saint me ran , my mother in law , madame de saint me ran , barrois , and my daughter valentine . ah , sir , exclaimed madame de villefort , clasping her hands , what do you say ? it is not for you to interrogate , but to answer . is it to the judge or to the husband ? stammered madame de villefort .: 19.76
<S> 14 greek militiamen in the war for independence . ed .: 234.09
<S> the arts change about and make a tour of the world ; things take a different name , and the vulgar do not follow them that is all ; but there is always the same result .: 78.33
<S> think of your joy , mother , when you see me return with an embroidered uniform !: 83.32
<S> as for me , he added , with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man , when i have completed my affairs in paris , i shall go and die in the east ; and should you wish to see me again , you must seek me at cairo , bagdad , or ispahan . 20087m ma foi , said franz , it would be the easiest thing in the world ; for i feel eagle s wings springing out at my shoulders , and with those wings i could make a tour of the world in four and twenty hours . ah , yes , the hashish is beginning its work .: 33.82
<S> when she recovered , her father was by her side .: 40.66
<S> my lord , one last favor . what ?: 64.02
<S> what is the matter ? asked milady .: 5.10
<S> the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor .: 40.92
<S> it was a pledge , a remembrance .: 35.44
<S> mm .: 143.49
<S> we request you , then , if you really have business here , to wait till we have finished our repast , or to come again a short time hence ; unless , which would be far better , you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels , and come and drink with us to the health of the king of france . take care , athos ! cried d artagnan ; don t you see they are aiming ? yes , yes , said athos ; but they are only civilians very bad marksmen , who will be sure not to hit me . in fact , at the same instant four shots were fired , and the balls were flattened against the wall around athos , but not one touched him .: 37.86
<S> well , my dear parry , said he , what is the matter , and what can affect you in this manner ? oh , my king , said parry , with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication , do not look to the left as we leave the hall . and why , parry ? do not look , i implore you , my king . but what is the matter ?: 21.66
<S> now let me try on the dress of yonder chap .: 52.02
<S> and that is a mousetrap .: 21.68
<S> i am but a minister , who wants no servants , being myself nothing but a servant of the queen s .: 64.45
<S> i ruined ?: 232.96
<S> m. de monte cristo may have heard it , and to enlighten himself but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject ? asked villefort , after a moment s reflection , what interest can this m. de monte cristo or m. zaccone , son of a shipowner of malta , discoverer of a mine in thessaly , now visiting paris for the first time , what interest , i say , can he take in discovering a gloomy , mysterious , and useless fact like this ?: 66.92
<S> from that moment the old man s eyes were fixed on the door , and did not quit it .: 13.40
<S> they will have nothing to do , then at this end ? said mordaunt .: 25.87
<S> but all these reasons were combated , destroyed , overthrown , by that feeling of intimate pain which , on certain occasions , takes possession of our being , and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfortune is hanging over us .: 89.81
<S> do you , then , love merce de s ? i adore her ! for long ? as long as i have known her always . and you sit there , tearing your hair , instead of seeking to remedy your condition ; i did not think that was the way of your people . what would you have me do ? said fernand .: 39.41
<S> there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here , and the grass is soft . the duke had already begun to descend .: 42.66
<S> the stranger , then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery , drew his sword , saluted his adversary , and seriously placed himself on guard .: 67.28
<S> i accelerate your ruin ?: 212.02
<S> fairfax , answered a laughing voice , the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman , is not such a fool as to be here . a loud laugh followed these words , pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weakness a weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance .: 73.46
<S> mazarin !: 58.90
<S> come , come , signor pastrini , no joking ; we must have a carriage . sir , replied the host , we will do all in our power to procure you one this is all i can say . and when shall we know ? inquired franz .: 24.84
<S> but how do you mean to pass your time till i come back ?: 32.26
<S> gentlemen , he continued , addressing the cavaliers , who became more and more numerous every instant ; gentlemen , encircle his eminence , that you may show him the greater honor .: 48.99
<S> dante s rose , advanced a few steps , and , with a fervent prayer of gratitude , stretched himself on the granite , which seemed to him softer than down .: 34.83
<S> go , d artagnan , go ; grimaud will accompany you with his musketoon . a half hour afterward , d artagnan returned with the two thousand livres , and without having met with any accident .: 33.34
<S> d artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable ; and having again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton , and paid his bill to the host , he resumed his route with planchet , already relieved of one of his led horses .: 62.92
<S> my officer , said the sergeant , it is not permitted to stop here . that prohibition is not for me , said d artagnan .: 18.87
<S> it is war , said the prince .: 10.97
<S> imagine to yourself a don quixote of eighteen ; a don quixote without his corselet , without his coat of mail , without his cuisses ; a don quixote clothed in a woolen doublet , the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine and a heavenly azure ; face long and brown ; high cheek bones , a sign of sagacity ; the maxillary muscles enormously developed , an infallible sign by which a gascon may always be detected , even without his cap and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of feather ; the eye open and intelligent ; the nose hooked , but finely chiseled .: 128.15
<S> you will see , danglars , that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us . nonsense !: 54.22
<S> he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow .: 25.32
<S> he was an irishman one of the most skillful of his craft , and who himself confessed that he gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the duke of buckingham .: 26.90
<S> i may sleep , perhaps , at an inn . pierre obeyed .: 54.56
<S> eight thousand crowns amounted to 48,000 livres ; he would then have about 5,050,000 francs left .: 164.42
<S> this something was enveloped in a cloak , and d artagnan at first believed it was a man ; but by the smallness of the form , the hesitation of the walk , and the indecision of the step , he soon discovered that it was a woman .: 35.06
<S> i mean to ask if you are married ? ah !: 27.77
<S> john felton , i trust your word !: 55.60
<S> monsieur bertuccio , said the count , did you never tell me that you had travelled in france ? in some parts of france yes , excellency . you know the environs of paris , then ? no , excellency , no , returned the steward , with a sort of nervous trembling , which monte cristo , a connoisseur in all emotions , rightly attributed to great disquietude .: 37.32
<S> kitty entered to bring some sherbet .: 133.27
<S> at times he thought of those brave french gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal , like the forms that appear in dreams .: 66.89
<S> what i propose to do is fair in war ; the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of means .: 81.96
<S> roman bandits chapter 34 .: 55.08
<S> whither goes she ? added he , strongly interested in the route milady followed .: 211.36
<S> and now to table , said athos .: 22.41
<S> how would you like to have it ?: 24.24
<S> i am half an hour in advance of them , an hour , perhaps .: 24.17
<S> i could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me , and yet for what other cause could she have returned to paris ? for the cause which today takes us to england . and what is this cause ? demanded aramis .: 47.46
<S> for part of the day he went into the courtyard , seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun .: 40.35
<S> second , porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his thigh , as the englishman , without making any further resistance , then surrendered his sword , porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to his carriage .: 43.04
<S> he received thirty sous per day , and for a month he returned to his lodgings gay as a chaffinch , and affable toward his master .: 43.56
<S> cucumetto stopped at last , and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree .: 35.27
<S> he took the arm of cha teau renaud , and turned towards the vault , where the attendants had already placed the two coffins .: 17.09
<S> the last two mounted guard at the door during this examination ; then , when all was over , they went away , leaving the house empty and exposed . and porthos and aramis ? i could not find them ; they did not come . but they may come any moment , for you left word that i awaited them ? yes , monsieur . well , don t budge , then ; if they come , tell them what has happened .: 42.30
<S> what a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar .: 74.42
<S> never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely , and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up .: 84.91
<S> he entertains a very high opinion of m. and madame de villefort . which they deserve , do they not ? i believe they do .: 45.81
<S> when he compared the public crimes of this minister startling crimes , european crimes , if so we may say with the private and unknown crimes with which milady had charged him , felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the life .: 115.15
<S> a detachment of carbineers , fifteen abreast , galloped up the corso in order to clear it for the barberi .: 58.58
<S> at a hundred steps , on turning to the left , you will find the wall of the park ; get over it , and in three leaps you will be on the road and free . ah !: 31.70
<S> the road to picardy .: 20.24
<S> more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure , always returning by the same path , to begin his walk again , at the same pace and with the same gesture , when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house , whence he heard the noisy play of his son , who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother .: 56.22
<S> speak , gentlemen , said the prince , saluting them ; first speak ; we shall have time afterward for the usual compliments .: 50.00
<S> come , raoul , he said , let us follow this man . the verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the topmost step , whilst athos and raoul descended .: 41.45
<S> there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair ; but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition real ? interrupted the count , smiling .: 66.47
<S> let us save them half of their journey . and without caring whether he were followed or not he set off ; his regiment , which bore the name of the regiment of corinth , from the name of his archbishopric , darted after him and began the fight .: 49.12
<S> you see i am perfectly composed , said albert .: 23.28
<S> ask day after to morrow to have a pie supplied you by the new confectioner opposite the castle , and who is no other than noirmont , your former maitre d hotel .: 119.36
<S> mazarin , as a statesman , will understand the politic necessity . are you sure , said the queen doubtfully , that you have not been forestalled ? by whom ? by the joices , the prinns , the cromwells ? by a tailor , a coachmaker , a brewer !: 47.36
<S> this milady , this woman , this creature , this demon , has a brother in law , as i think you told me , d artagnan ? yes , i know him very well ; and i also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sister in law . there is no harm in that .: 26.02
<S> two men , to the astonishment of d artagnan , appeared shortly ; soon , however , his surprise vanished , for he heard the murmurs of a soft , harmonious voice ; one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier .: 36.52
<S> be satisfied of that ; these two can not have drunk all the cellar .: 36.08
<S> i came to tell you that i also look upon you as my enemy .: 29.13
<S> they drew near to the sloop .: 17.29
<S> your daughter will be married tomorrow , if not today in a week , if not tomorrow ; and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter . madame danglars gazed on villefort , stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm .: 54.87
<S> i am an assassin , then , and not an officer of justice ! and he closed his eyes with a groan .: 18.15
<S> well , let me see , what can you want that begins with n ?: 35.10
<S> to you alone , then , may i confide my sorrows and my hopes ? the paralytic motioned yes . valentine took maximilian s hand .: 60.07
<S> while we wait , time will be progressing , events will succeed each other ; things which in the evening look dark and obscure , appear but too clearly in the light of morning , and sometimes the utterance of one word , or the lapse of a single day , will reveal the most cruel calumnies . calumnies , did you say , sir ? cried morcerf , turning livid with rage .: 95.32
<S> she inquired for the convent of the carmelites , and went thither immediately .: 28.68
<S> these horses evidently belonged to the three men , who were dressed as cavaliers .: 49.90
<S> if i had them i should think myself as rich as croesus . then aloud : are you ambitious ? as enceladus . well , my friend , i bring you the means of becoming rich , powerful , and free to do whatever you wish . the shadow of a cloud passed over aramis s face as quickly as that which in august passes over the field of grain ; but quick as it was , it did not escape d artagnan s observation .: 46.65
<S> he again arose and went to the door .: 11.71
<S> dante s carefully collected the plaster , carried it into the corner of his cell , and covered it with earth .: 24.93
<S> monte cristo returned to his bedroom , and , glancing rapidly from the garden to the street , he saw first caderousse , who after walking to the end of the garden , fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in .: 40.07
<S> this mystery required an explanation ; at least , so d artagnan declared to himself .: 42.75
<S> the inquiry m. de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars , to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil .: 29.31
<S> wait ; then , during the day , tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes .: 76.37
<S> executioner , as you were , of king charles !: 73.88
<S> and i of speaking to baron danglars , chevalier of the legion of honor , and member of the chamber of deputies ? monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron s card .: 41.85
<S> and now , continued he , you must change your clothes ; your servants , to whom i gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat , ought to be already at the inn .: 34.04
<S> this was m. morrel s wish also , who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent ; but the old man resisted , and cried so that they were actually frightened .: 55.28
<S> d artagnan went to take leave of m. de tre ville .: 8.36
<S> but i lay aside that pride before god , who has taken me from nothing to make me what i am . then , count , i admire you , said villefort , who , for the first time in this strange conversation , used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage , whom , until now , he had only called monsieur .: 50.57
<S> when he had mounted his phaeton , monte cristo turned , and seeing bertuccio , what news ? said he .: 30.83
<S> no , my lord , and i will set out at once .: 8.80
<S> see , said d avrigny to villefort , nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow .: 50.96
<S> now , m. de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal ; in the first case , i shall leave directly , and in the second , i shall wait till i am of age , which will be in about ten months .: 36.56
<S> valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude , and villefort was biting his lips with vexation , while madame de villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy , which , in spite of herself , appeared in her whole countenance .: 27.14
<S> besides , the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to me .: 49.40
<S> what was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me ?: 59.19
<S> d artagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarked for nothing had led him to the examination that the ground , trampled here and hoofmarked there , presented confused traces of men and horses .: 107.73
<S> then take pistols with thee and a hunting knife . are we then going to travel , my lord ? asked mousqueton , rather uneasy .: 72.11
<S> this is what you asked for , he said , and what i promised to give you . i thank you from the depths of my heart , said the young man , taking the spoon from the hands of monte cristo .: 16.32
<S> the rencontre .: 51.72
<S> then he added , in a low tone , yes ; that is the haven . and then he again plunged into a train of thought , the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile , than it would have been by tears .: 38.73
<S> he recalled to his mind the details of the first night , and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he re entered the ho tel and flew toward kitty s chamber .: 43.98
<S> i really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself , responded lucien , raising his lorgnette to his eye .: 63.48
<S> i am not in love with mademoiselle merce de s ; but for you in the words of the gospel , seek , and you shall find . i have found already . what ? i would stab the man , but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed , she would kill herself . pooh !: 41.86
<S> this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour .: 32.29
<S> the fact was that emery s son had run a great chance of being suffocated , one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed .: 65.26
<S> yes , frankly and loyally , replied the cardinal , in the same tone .: 21.60
<S> to imprison him , monseigneur ?: 66.67
<S> they are the spoils of victory . i , the heir of an enemy ! said athos ; for whom , then , do you take me ? it is the custom in war , said d artagnan , why should it not be the custom in a duel ? even on the field of battle , i have never done that . porthos shrugged his shoulders ; aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed athos .: 35.65
<S> you see there are two wanting . eight days , my lord . i will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if i can have them by the day after tomorrow . my lord , they shall be yours . you are a jewel of a man , mr. o reilly ; but that is not all .: 34.48
<S> you receive 1,500 francs per annum for your services here more than many a brave subaltern , who continually risks his life for his country , obtains .: 123.57
<S> then they came and boasted of their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village , where my brother and i were drinking . and what did you do ? said d artagnan .: 38.82
<S> after a wild youth , he had retired into a convent , there to expiate , at least for some time , the follies of adolescence .: 62.12
<S> six o clock came and , although they were not to sit down to table until seven o clock , dinner was ready and served up .: 44.43
<S> the new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor .: 59.28
<S> you had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired ; and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want , when god worked a miracle in your behalf , sending you , by my hands , a fortune brilliant , indeed , for you , who had never possessed any .: 95.04
<S> just then , madame de villefort , in the act of slipping on her dressing gown , threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless , as though interrogating the occupants of the room , while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears .: 37.17
<S> all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman ; and her looks , fixed on the future , beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal , whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair .: 67.44
<S> but he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away , and the devil has somewhat aided him .: 43.61
<S> the spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle , in order to strike raoul on the head with the butt .: 45.62
<S> i am no relation of yours . you are my son , dante s , exclaimed the old man .: 17.70
<S> after continuing some time in profound meditation , the young man suddenly exclaimed , i have found what you were in search of ! faria started : have you , indeed ? cried he , raising his head with quick anxiety ; pray , let me know what it is you have discovered ? the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here , extends in the same direction as the outer gallery , does it not ? 0207m it does . and is not above fifteen feet from it ? about that . well , then , i will tell you what we must do .: 61.60
<S> i once , she said , despised the love of a cardinal who never said i shall do , but , i have done so and so . that man knew of retreats more secure than rueil , darker and more silent even than the bastile .: 90.76
<S> two soldiers were accordingly sent for , and the inspector descended a stairway , so foul , so humid , so dark , as to be loathsome to sight , smell , and respiration .: 70.66
<S> i am m. mordaunt . ah ! thought d artagnan , the man i am warned against by athos . ah ! thought porthos , the man aramis wants me to strangle . they both looked searchingly at the young man , who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition .: 50.59
<S> yes yes , said caderousse ; but you were right to return as soon as possible , my boy . and why ? because merce de s is a very fine girl , and fine girls never lack followers ; she particularly has them by dozens . really ? answered edmond , with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness .: 56.37
<S> or , at least , i will go later . he drew kitty to him .: 22.08
<S> it goes without saying that when he saw a huguenot coming , he felt himself filled with such ardent catholic zeal that he could not understand how , a quarter of an hour before , he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion .: 37.43
<S> come , then , said the minister ; i will conduct you to her , but remember , not one word of our conversation . what has passed between us concerns ourselves alone , my lord , replied d artagnan .: 22.38
<S> still , in spite of this reciprocal politeness , the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness ; louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain himself .: 52.44
<S> yes , and that s all settled ; only it will be an infamous shame ; and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter .: 26.62
<S> the poor duke swore , fell into a rage , yelled , and declared that they wished to starve him to death as they had starved the marechal ornano and the grand prior of vendome ; but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter .: 76.70
<S> faith !: 32.97
<S> i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek ; one is , i believe , from ph drus , and the other from bias .: 59.58
<S> charles stuart , you are our prisoner . and both extended their hands as if to seize the king , but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers , both had fallen , one dead , the other stunned .: 55.57
<S> and the steward followed the notary out of the room .: 30.85
<S> a quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard .: 55.37
<S> their number was formidable , now that he had begun to fear , and yet these names , powerful though they were , had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences , the almost impassable paths , and the fearful chasms , through which he has so perilously climbed .: 87.96
<S> have you observed , said he to them , what a blood red color the moon has to night ? no , replied athos ; i thought it looked much the same as usual . look , again , chevalier , returned lord winter .: 60.27
<S> where , my god ? where we have orders to lead you . but that is not an answer . it is , nevertheless , the only one we can give . ah , my god , my god ! murmured the poor mercer , now , indeed , i am lost ! and he followed the guards who came for him , mechanically and without resistance .: 29.67
<S> she was free now to give way to her transports without being observed .: 45.20
<S> if it is only to be recognized , why the saddle will suffice for that ; it is quite remarkable enough .: 39.59
<S> as for franz , he examined his arms with the utmost coolness ; he had two double barrelled guns and a rifle ; he loaded them , looked at the priming , and waited quietly .: 36.80
<S> all had plainly seen a woman s head appear at the window , but none of them , except athos , knew mme .: 54.77
<S> he listened to know whence this sound could proceed .: 76.50
<S> thus all may go well all may be for the best ; but we do not go far from this place ? seven or eight leagues at the most .: 65.45
<S> the handsome madeleine announced to d artagnan that planchet had returned , bringing mousqueton with him , who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit .: 69.51
<S> you alarm me .: 19.75
<S> morrel looked at his watch , which wanted a quarter to ten ; but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half past nine .: 73.94
<S> many observations were made , the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room .: 59.78
<S> this last obstacle having been overcome , the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor ; but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace ; three of them stopped after an hour s gallop , and one fell down .: 70.45
<S> he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food .: 105.70
<S> fortunately , however , he had not been taken ; the people , believing that he had escaped by some back entrance , retired and left him at liberty to retreat .: 37.28
<S> when i returned she was married .: 39.70
<S> the next day the prisoner s room was full of pictures and mottoes .: 35.87
<S> he inquired how they were fed , and if they had any request to make .: 25.98
<S> he will be condemned , will he not ? asked debray of beauchamp .: 23.04
<S> but , as we have said , it was at least a league from the cha teau d if to this island .: 10.67
<S> yes , i will tell you all ; but take away the young man ; i can not endure his presence . he is going with me .: 25.21
<S> you asked the name of that young lady .: 27.61
<S> danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say .: 30.06
<S> i said a million , replied danglars , with the confidence of ignorance .: 34.17
<S> but for the sake of the mother ? said the count .: 15.02
<S> then d artagnan , disposed to become the most tender of lovers , was at the same time a very devoted friend .: 32.59
<S> yes , that is the very boy ; he s patronized by bazin . ah , yes , i know . of what importance is this little reptile to you ? asked porthos .: 29.33
<S> her will be done , like that of god , in all things . then , he began to kiss , one after the other , those dear studs with which he was about to part .: 46.58
<S> behold for what end the wretched mazarin has made use of you .: 149.17
<S> he then rose , and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness .: 25.35
<S> in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance , the duchess seemed to be looking for some one ; at last she found out raoul and her eyes sparkled ; she perceived athos and became thoughtful ; she saw aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan .: 44.98
<S> general , said the president , do not alarm yourself ; you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity , but as you have said , you are among conspirators , you are in possession of our secret , and you must restore it to us . a significant silence followed these words , and as the general did not reply , close the doors , said the president to the door keeper .: 40.33
<S> this was the price of the queen s diamond .: 16.41
<S> poor dante s ! said caderousse .: 16.72
<S> la rochelle , which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other calvinist cities , was , then , the focus of dissensions and ambition .: 52.99
<S> gentlemen , said athos , a wager ! ah , wooi , a vager ! cried the swiss .: 24.64
<S> is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it ? quite so ; my steward transacts all this business for me . it is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied , said cha teau renaud , and it was quite melancholy to look at it , with the blinds closed , the doors locked , and the weeds in the court .: 39.60
<S> i have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him , and i pray you to do so also .: 27.94
<S> and in what part of auteuil do you reside ? rue de la fontaine . rue de la fontaine ! exclaimed villefort in an agitated tone ; at what number ? no .: 28.59
<S> fifty thousand francs ! muttered la carconte when left alone ; it is a large sum of money , but it is not a fortune . volume two 20009m 20011m 20019m chapter 28 .: 50.35
<S> speak , then , chevalier ! said the cardinal .: 11.05
<S> d artagnan crossed the quays , went out by the gate of la confe rence and followed the road , much more beautiful then than it is now , which leads to st .: 56.32
<S> this formal announcement , which implied or appeared to imply , the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair , had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted .: 61.60
<S> mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment .: 49.45
<S> during the last five or six months that this weakness had been felt , the worthy procurator had nearly become the slave of his wife .: 41.29
<S> remember , raoul , this !: 56.36
<S> no !: 15.96
<S> a name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way .: 57.26
<S> it was ten o clock at night ; the branches of the great trees in the garden of the count s house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven , which was studded with golden stars , but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered .: 53.39
<S> i wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal ; do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing ? danger , my lord ! exclaimed d artagnan with a look of astonishment , what danger ? i am told that there is a general insurrection . the uniform of the king s musketeers carries a certain respect with it , and even if that were not the case i would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns . did you witness the injury sustained by comminges ? monsieur de comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers which means , i suppose , that the musketeers are better soldiers than the guards . the cardinal smiled as he spoke .: 53.97
<S> in a word , mademoiselle danglars would make a charming mistress but a wife diable ! and this , said monte cristo , is your opinion of your intended spouse ? yes ; it is rather unkind , i acknowledge , but it is true .: 32.41
<S> go and tell him the ring is his , d artagnan , and bring back the two hundred pistoles with you . reflect , athos ! ready money is needful for the present time , and we must learn how to make sacrifices .: 52.78
<S> i want air , that is all . will you come into the garden ? said debray , advancing towards the back staircase .: 25.82
<S> why , the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that .: 53.66
<S> you ask what god is doing .: 75.79
<S> i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea .: 81.36
<S> why , of downright starvation . starvation ! exclaimed the abbe , springing from his seat .: 41.67
<S> he had a remarkably fine garden , full of vegetables , flowers , and fruit .: 34.84
<S> it has its own effect upon the most incredulous ; and far from being incredulous , mazarin was superstitious .: 81.16
<S> some gendarme ! he exclaimed .: 30.81
<S> pistache , on a signal from his master , placed himself on this line , raised himself on his hind paws , and holding in his front paws a wand with which clothes used to be beaten , he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a rope dancer .: 78.70
<S> now as you are one of the whole world , i mean to say that you also are deserting me . cardinal ! heavens !: 37.69
<S> she was a most atrocious woman . and then , said aramis , with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which there was more atheism than confidence in god , what is the use of thinking of it all ?: 43.50
<S> he had not long to wait , for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with mazarin , but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him .: 37.33
<S> m. noirtier again closed his eyes .: 17.37
<S> i will introduce you to him , for it will be necessary he should know you , as he is to pay your money . full dress ? said the major , half aloud .: 32.45
<S> four men , disguised as workmen , were to get the king out of prison and take him to greenwich , where a vessel was waiting . and knowing all that , your honor remained here , far from the city , tranquil and inactive . tranquil , yes , replied cromwell .: 56.51
<S> it bears his signature , as you see , which is all sufficient . bring me a million such as that , said danglars , i shall be well pleased , putting the draft in his pocket .: 39.21
<S> he thought of the fair greek he had seen in the count s box at the argentina and valle theatres .: 29.63
<S> the project gutenberg ebook of the count of monte cristo , illustrated this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the united states and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever .: 19.53
<S> whom would they hang , yourself or me ?: 218.45
<S> and you ? as for me , i am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers i shall not find ten louis at home .: 43.46
<S> the blow was sped by d artagnan ; the rapier had pierced his bosom .: 34.44
<S> debray , who perceived the gathering clouds , and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars rage , suddenly recollected an appointment , which compelled him to take his leave ; while monte cristo , unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain , made a farewell bow and departed , leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife .: 77.69
<S> toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villefort s for the purpose of returning the procureur s visit , and at his name , as may be easily imagined , the whole house was in confusion .: 28.68
<S> having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the alle es de meilhan belonged , dante s next proceeded thither , and , under the name of lord wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport , purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty five thousand francs , at least ten thousand more than it was worth ; but had its owner asked half a million , it would unhesitatingly have been given .: 56.62
<S> the prisoner did not understand , or seemed not to understand , what raoul said to him ; and raoul could hardly understand his replies , containing a mixture of flemish and alsatian .: 64.65
<S> the count , by any opening from the bedroom , or by concealing himself in the dressing room , would be able to defend his property himself .: 44.46
<S> who is that swiss ? asked d artagnan .: 12.03
<S> women weep for the dead ; men avenge them ! oh , yes ! cried d artagnan , yes !: 42.51
<S> madame de villefort fell at her husband s feet .: 15.82
<S> the frenchman entered , leaving in the anteroom his guide , who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in rome at the doors of banking houses , churches , museums , or theatres .: 63.99
<S> madame de villefort , in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make , secretly approved of the proposition , my father consented to it at her instigation , and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project .: 45.85
<S> thus the genoese , subtle as he was , was duped by edmond , in whose favor his mild demeanor , his nautical skill , and his admirable dissimulation , pleaded .: 80.90
<S> at this fernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died , and dropped again heavily on his seat .: 97.10
<S> misfortune refreshes the memory .: 113.08
<S> come , my friend , said he , courage . then he turned to the officer .: 13.81
<S> i have , happily , only myself in the world to care for . but what makes you sigh ? my dear fellow , replied porthos , to be candid with you , i am not happy . you are not happy , porthos ?: 31.80
<S> edmond listened , and the sound became more and more distinct .: 23.62
<S> the two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives , without arms .: 74.04
<S> a handsome young fellow like you does not obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress ; and we were impatiently waited for at paris , were we not ? my faith ! said the young man , laughing , i confess it , and so much more the readily , my dear bonacieux , as i see there is no concealing anything from you .: 46.12
<S> peter blessed with the fingers .: 216.38
<S> then steer for monte cristo . the captain gave his orders , the helm was put up , and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island .: 31.86
<S> but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars , as the events had transpired after the messenger s departure ; namely , that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly .: 64.50
<S> monte cristo was more affectionate than ever , indeed , his manner was so kind that several times morrel was on the point of telling him all .: 37.28
<S> well ? continued she .: 21.99
<S> ah , here is a private staircase , said the count ; that is convenient .: 18.57
<S> c sar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends , that is to say , in the first place , the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard .: 46.21
<S> deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation , valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation .: 34.39
<S> well , yes , madame , said the novice , are we rivals ? the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances mme .: 42.99
<S> well . inquired franz , after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box , what do you think of our opposite neighbor ? 20147m why , that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form . this fresh allusion to byron5 drew a smile to franz s countenance ; although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires , it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him .: 63.00
<S> he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight , as he had shown him saint peter s by daylight .: 72.14
<S> as long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land , he kept his face toward milady , who , standing on the deck , followed him with her eyes .: 22.29
<S> i can not make you share the fate i have planned for myself .: 43.89
<S> m. de villefort entered his father s room , followed by madame de villefort .: 9.91
<S> then , seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject , porthos called the host and asked for dice .: 81.93
<S> he had my love !: 64.32
<S> really , yes , said the coadjutor , i have heard this affair mentioned .: 22.46
<S> the young man turned quickly round , for this attack could not have come from the bastion , which was hidden by the angle of the trench .: 22.57
<S> here , he said , take this pocket book . do you give it to me ? yes ; but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone ; and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found , which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel , he rushed out of the corridor , and reaching his boat , cried , to marseilles ! then , as he departed , he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison .: 30.84
<S> must i take anything with me ? money , if you have any . yes ; fortunately they have left me all i had . so much the better , for i have expended all mine in chartering a vessel . here ! said milady , placing a bag full of louis in felton s hands .: 51.49
<S> but i am not surprised ; the spring has been warm this year , and strawberries require heat , sir .: 116.24
<S> in the midst of our misfortunes , we are still rich enough not to require assistance from anyone .: 30.72
<S> well , what is the matter ? asked the young lieutenant .: 6.16
<S> go . oh , count , you overwhelm me with that coolness .: 26.59
<S> the young woman complied .: 29.73
<S> will you take charge of our invitation to messieurs cavalcanti ? when will it take place ? on saturday . m .: 42.17
<S> fatality .: 101.49
<S> perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the abbe , perhaps his kind charity , perhaps his persuasive words , which had restored the courage of noirtier , for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for valentine .: 119.85
<S> then d artagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was merely acting .: 44.20
<S> the blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around .: 56.35
<S> you have a quick horse , a light tilbury , you are naturally as slippery as an eel ; if i had missed you tonight , i might not have had another chance . you see , i do not conceal myself . you are lucky ; i wish i could say as much , for i do conceal myself ; and then i was afraid you would not recognize me , but you did , added caderousse with his unpleasant smile .: 42.17
<S> the carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car .: 58.81
<S> my uncle , answered mordaunt ; but traitors to england are no longer members of my family . cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence , then , with that profound melancholy shakespeare describes so well : mordaunt , he said , you are a terrible servant . when the lord commands , said mordaunt , his commands are not to be disputed .: 56.56
<S> he was less stiff than formerly .: 45.03
<S> it was our strength , our intelligence , our life , in short , that we promised .: 40.84
<S> how strong one feels here ! said porthos , almost burying his large feet in the sands .: 98.06
<S> no , no ; i am here , said the monk , quickly coming back to him .: 16.94
<S> at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat .: 73.66
<S> you are of so superior a mind , nothing escapes you . why do you say so ? because , for instance , you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave , that m. de monte cristo would eat nothing in our house . merce de s raised herself on her feverish arm .: 40.23
<S> what have i said ? you said that porthos had received a sword cut . yes , but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so . and why so . zounds , monsieur !: 45.75
<S> the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested . what !: 45.88
<S> i will do my best . well , then , let us go i must trust to you . it is very fortunate , said d artagnan to himself .: 11.85
<S> it was planchet , but so completely transformed , thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind , that d artagnan himself could hardly recognize him .: 51.75
<S> hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war , and as she considers you a man of superior talent , and consequently dangerous , she desired me to make sure of you ; that is the reason of your being shut up in the bastile .: 65.11
<S> my apartment will be close to his .: 41.29
<S> the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair .: 38.33
<S> therefore let us separate .: 37.56
<S> should he demand an explanation from the bandits , or should he wait patiently for them to propose it ?: 88.75
<S> i don t like mazarin any better than you do .: 62.70
<S> madame de saint me ran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine , which by some mistake , perhaps , has been given to her . villefort seized the doctor s hand .: 31.94
<S> oh , then my father has really a very large fortune , count ? it appears so , sir , replied monte cristo .: 25.63
<S> sir , cried the latter , am i no longer at liberty to receive whom i choose in my house ?: 26.08
<S> this time d artagnan was only in part mistaken ; he himself was not in question , but his horse was .: 34.69
<S> i believe so ; i don t know ; it s of no consequence .: 19.67
<S> join the escort ! cried aramis .: 29.95
<S> at this unusual sound , a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode , snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society .: 113.85
<S> like all upstarts , he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position .: 38.56
<S> a mousetrap in the seventeenth century chapter xi .: 23.25
<S> its purple visage , and its violet colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation , but as it was not yet cold , i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet .: 54.79
<S> at that instant , the moon , inquisitive , perhaps , like d artagnan , came from behind a cloud and by her light d artagnan recognized the large blue eyes , the golden hair and the classic head of the duchess de longueville .: 45.48
<S> two minutes later the thunder of a horse s hoofs was heard upon the road ; it was grimaud , on his way to paris .: 24.44
<S> everything fell out as mme .: 66.52
<S> would you like to become rich , or at least independent ?: 46.16
<S> in consequence he took to his heels , arrived breathlessly at the councillor s door , and knocked violently .: 53.73
<S> the two friends turned down the first street they came to .: 35.90
<S> comminges turned and saw dame nanette , her eyes flashing with anger and a broom in her hand .: 46.64
<S> gentlemen !: 25.46
<S> what does this mean , monsieur cardinal ? asked the king in a severe tone .: 18.68
<S> what story can i invent ?: 73.08
<S> fernand went , and merce de s remained alone .: 20.46
<S> but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn .: 206.39
<S> his looking glass had assured him , during his stay at leghorn , that he ran no risk of recognition ; moreover , he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper .: 79.17
<S> yes , count , you know what i told you ? all remains the same , then , in that quarter ? it is more than ever a settled thing , said lucien , and , considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make , he adjusted the glass to his eye , and biting the top of his gold headed cane , began to make the tour of the apartment , examining the arms and the pictures .: 47.32
<S> then they lift and sink again , and both go under at once .: 80.51
<S> one could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the cloak .: 52.49
<S> do not fly , then .: 22.19
<S> the letter from the executioner s assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he expected .: 102.91
<S> d avrigny followed the invalid , wrote a prescription , ordered villefort to take a cabriolet , go in person to a chemist s to get the prescribed medicine , bring it himself , and wait for him in his daughter s room .: 64.79
<S> the two prisoners chapter 15 .: 20.96
<S> from time to time caderousse darted on his wife keen , searching glances , but rapid as the lightning flash .: 88.73
<S> have you studied our scotch troops and have you confidence in them ? the scotch ? inquired winter .: 86.25
<S> now , then , all is agreed ; let us go down . you are going into the garden ? yes . go along this corridor , down a little staircase , and you are in it . excellent ; thank you ! and the two women parted , exchanging charming smiles .: 38.11
<S> if he comes to france will you accord him hospitality ?: 75.19
<S> ah , count , said albert , i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me , and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you , you must be entirely devoid of them , for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else . you have talked of me ? yes , that is the penalty of being a living puzzle ! then i am also a puzzle to your mother ?: 41.04
<S> and such magnificent hair !: 134.87
<S> in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor s answer .: 30.32
<S> in an instant he had cleared every obstacle away , and he saw successively the lock , placed between two padlocks , and the two handles at each end , all carved as things were carved at that epoch , when art rendered the commonest metals precious .: 90.97
<S> never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself . willingly , answered the stranger ; if , indeed , you feel any curiosity respecting one , now , alas , powerless to aid you in any way . say not so ; you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind .: 55.39
<S> what does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind , at once implacable and generous ?: 105.08
<S> if you succeed i do not say that you will save a king ; no , in presence of the scaffold as i am , royalty , i assure you , is a very small affair ; but you will save a husband to his wife , a father to his children .: 42.36
<S> the drawing rooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters , the boudoirs hung with draperies from china , of fanciful colors , fantastic design , and wonderful texture .: 81.45
<S> she was pale , and looked fatigued , either from tears or want of sleep .: 46.95
<S> it s nothing , it s nothing ! said milady .: 18.95
<S> the two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of comminges ; those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms .: 50.10
<S> thus he came along , supporting himself on a curiously carved stick , his aged countenance lit up with happiness , looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796 , parading the newly opened gardens of the luxembourg and tuileries .: 104.47
<S> yes , for an instant i hoped it was so .: 33.77
<S> tis thou , rascal ! said he , come here : so thou hast changed thy trade ; thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy ; thou hast become a horse stealer ? ah , your honor , how can you say so ? exclaimed friquet .: 75.22
<S> deuce take em , what a popular commotion ! continued the giant , in his quiet manner ; but i knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of balizarde .: 94.57
<S> albert appeared not to notice this remark , which was , however , so rude that madame danglars blushed .: 38.41
<S> an englishman you say ? yes , replied maximilian , an englishman , who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french , at rome .: 35.78
<S> it was the man of meung .: 12.18
<S> and you are a fool for having said anything about it , said a voice from the top of the stairs .: 19.12
<S> ah , don t touch me , pray don t. by this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets ; his head fell back , and the lower extremities of the body began to stiffen .: 55.94
<S> the door closed , and dante s advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall ; he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness .: 28.67
<S> faugh ! he exclaimed , retreating to the farther corner of his cell .: 27.26
<S> he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure , as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent .: 76.93
<S> gentlemen , said andrea , commanding silence by his voice and manner ; i owe you the proofs and explanations of what i have said . but , said the irritated president , you called yourself benedetto , declared yourself an orphan , and claimed corsica as your country . i said anything i pleased , in order that the solemn declaration i have just made should not be withheld , which otherwise would certainly have been the case .: 72.31
<S> help me , lend me your assistance ! noirtier looked at the dictionary .: 25.68
<S> they must die die all together killed at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of god s .: 83.61
<S> be this evening about ten o clock at st .: 35.16
<S> then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch , from which each took a concealed musket ; the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in weapons .: 77.31
<S> ah , sir , he exclaimed , it was you !: 10.36
<S> i am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter .: 20.19
<S> the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her .: 16.40
<S> inured as men may be to danger , forewarned as they may be of peril , they understand , by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame , the enormous difference between a dream and a reality , between the project and the execution .: 84.17
<S> with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet , and saluted with respect .: 37.41
<S> albert , then , had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief , in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to believe .: 29.13
<S> ha , ha , ye romans !: 33.59
<S> a cloud settled on his brow , evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness , instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there .: 124.57
<S> then , m. morrel , i beg of you , said he , not to say a word to dante s on the subject .: 13.47
<S> no one had the slightest suspicion ; and when next day , taking a fowling piece , powder , and shot , dante s declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock , his wish was construed into a love of sport , or a desire for solitude .: 71.96
<S> wait , he continued , renewing his fruitless search ; it shall not be said that such devotion to a grandson of henry iv .: 34.99
<S> are you going ? pray , say everything that is kind to countess g on the part of her friend the vampire . and what message shall i convey to the baroness ! that , with her permission , i shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening . the third act had begun ; and during its progress the count of morcerf , according to his promise , made his appearance in the box of madame danglars .: 42.18
<S> give it back to him , sir , and since you have such a man in your service , make him useful . thank you , madame , said mazarin .: 23.65
<S> in my country the ladies do without chambermaids .: 110.15
<S> he is coming to play with us this evening . oho ! said porthos , his eyes glistening at the news .: 28.81
<S> surely , had not such been the case , he would not have perished by so dreadful a death . why , he was not altogether forsaken , continued caderousse , for merce de s the catalan and monsieur morrel were very kind to him ; but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for fernand the very person , added caderousse with a bitter smile , that you named just now as being one of dante s faithful and attached friends . and was he not so ? asked the abbe .: 56.13
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> i want to go into master broussel s house , captain , replied friquet , in that wheedling way the gamins of paris know so well how to assume when necessary .: 82.15
<S> there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother can not be made to understand .: 33.27
<S> in that case i should beat a retreat .: 26.06
<S> several strokes resounded on the door ; this time milady really pushed him away from her .: 66.64
<S> you have done your duty , and your conscience will be at rest . valentine fell on her knees , and pressed her almost bursting heart .: 25.42
<S> i began to fear that he would not come .: 22.87
<S> no , replied d artagnan , piqued , and thanks to my eyes , i can see what other people can not see . whether porthos understood him or did not understand him , giving way to his anger , monsieur , said he , you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion . chastised , monsieur ! said d artagnan , the expression is strong . it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face . ah , pardieu ! i know full well that you don t turn your back to yours . and the young man , delighted with his joke , went away laughing loudly .: 48.38
<S> in the whole house , said friquet ; the house belongs to him ; he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals ; he must be at dinner now ; it is noon . good , said comminges .: 51.25
<S> at his mother s ball he danced once with euge nie , and m. cavalcanti three times , and he took no notice of it . the valet announced the vicomte albert de morcerf .: 47.65
<S> a paltry piece of business ! murmured d artagnan crumpling his note .: 54.96
<S> pray forgive me . but there was no look calculated to reassure her ; all it seemed to say was , it is not only your reserve which afflicts me . what is it , then ? asked the young girl .: 32.46
<S> it was evident that he shared his master s apprehensions .: 16.39
<S> stop , gentlemen , said albert ; i have two words to say to the count of monte cristo . in private ? asked morrel .: 15.56
<S> this is all very well , murmured the king , yes , this is just the account the duke gave me of the affair .: 36.81
<S> aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions , and athos , who saw the duke advancing toward aramis with the rapidity of lightning , was just going to cry out , fire !: 42.72
<S> ah , if you could but help me if we could both together defeat their plan !: 97.25
<S> for our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers .: 108.95
<S> let us dispatch , said the duke .: 11.09
<S> these words were uttered in so mournful a tone that their real meaning did not escape albert ; he felt his heart beat , and taking his mother s hand within his own he said , tenderly : yes , you will live ! i shall live ! then you will not leave me , albert ? mother , i must go , said albert in a firm , calm voice ; you love me too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you ; besides , i have signed . 50145m you will obey your own wish and the will of heaven ! not my own wish , mother , but reason necessity .: 44.00
<S> you would love me , then , if you were not queen !: 23.23
<S> i tell you so to prove to you that i still hope . and after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count , merce de s rushed up the stairs and disappeared .: 35.00
<S> he arose , bowed , went out , returned by the same way he came , re entered the ho tel , and went to his apartment .: 22.36
<S> what chance brings you here , gentlemen ? said cha teau renaud , shaking hands with each of them .: 25.60
<S> monte cristo advanced a few steps , which were heard on the gravel .: 19.73
<S> then he saw through the whole thing .: 41.56
<S> limited warranty , disclaimer of damages except for the right of replacement or refund described in paragraph 1.f.3 , the project gutenberg literary archive foundation , the owner of the project gutenberg trademark , and any other party distributing a project gutenberg electronic work under this agreement , disclaim all liability to you for damages , costs and expenses , including legal fees .: 15.45
<S> the day after monte cristo had called upon danglars , the mysterious lodger entered at ten o clock in the morning instead of four in the afternoon .: 25.79
<S> the carmelite convent at be thune chapter lxii .: 87.70
<S> do you know where i shall find him ? near blois .: 24.72
<S> not to arouse suspicions , gentlemen , said he , go your way and i will go mine , and this evening at nine o clock we will assemble again at the gate saint denis .: 30.51
<S> but touching these spanish affairs , i think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the don carlos matter .: 81.90
<S> they might be said to be a procession of ghosts , for they were all wrapped in white cloaks .: 37.66
<S> i accept it , interposed d artagnan , proudly .: 30.88
<S> you have not deceived me !: 17.30
<S> yes , sire , yes , it is the same ; and your majesty has a good memory . come , how shall we decide ? said the king .: 15.45
<S> ali , mute and attentive , brought the pipes and coffee , and disappeared .: 52.74
<S> the shutter where euge nie had rapped was that of a little laundress , who had been previously warned , and was not yet gone to bed .: 52.79
<S> besides , i believe , between ourselves , she did this in order to distract her mind , that she might forget ; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart .: 49.55
<S> try and make an effort to do so , my good man . said d avrigny .: 24.51
<S> the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the united states .: 23.64
<S> four marble steps led down to the water s edge , and below them was a boat floating on the tide .: 77.28
<S> although , in justice , the people who arrest and imprison you , ought , at least , to feed you . that is not the custom , excellency , said peppino .: 41.56
<S> i , wretch ?: 73.20
<S> the butt end of the musket hovered over his head , and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes , when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat .: 49.94
<S> but to you , d artagnan , i am , i hope , still dear athos , your comrade , your friend .: 23.61
<S> well , it is not that the man is more ugly , more foolish , or more disagreeable than any other ; no , m. andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men s faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind .: 50.68
<S> i must reach compie gne tonight , or i shall cause deep anxiety to my family .: 85.30
<S> i have driven away the swiss to humiliate you , but i shall lodge here no longer .: 58.68
<S> the man was an enigma to franz .: 31.53
<S> but what help is there for it !: 119.19
<S> sure of himself , convinced of his own power , certain that the laws which rule other men could not reach him , he went straight to the object he aimed at , even were this object so elevated and so dazzling that it would have been madness for any other even to have contemplated it .: 101.35
<S> whom do i see yonder ? where ? in the street , facing your window , in the embrasure of that door a man wrapped in a cloak . it is he ! cried d artagnan and the citizen at the same time , each having recognized his man .: 40.88
<S> it was a be arn pony , from twelve to fourteen years old , yellow in his hide , without a hair in his tail , but not without windgalls on his legs , which , though going with his head lower than his knees , rendering a martingale quite unnecessary , contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day .: 109.61
<S> when they were within ten paces of him , d artagnan , who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword , sprang up close to them .: 30.62
<S> on the contrary , he added , laughing , if they want to see their stuart they shall see him .: 30.90
<S> certainly it is empty , replied the procurator s wife , in real innocence .: 32.00
<S> but d artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship .: 43.80
<S> the queen then began to read , and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes , dismissed her .: 32.92
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> you wish to speak to me alone ? said the marquis .: 12.60
<S> it seemed as though rome , under the magic breath of some demon of the night , had suddenly changed into a vast tomb .: 69.09
<S> her first look on entering the room was at noirtier , whose face , independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing , proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health ; her second glance was at the dying man .: 46.35
<S> can we have destroyed them all , from the first to the last ? said athos .: 41.44
<S> on the seventh of january between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had assembled in paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house property .: 80.93
<S> well , ali , my nubian , believes me to be an arab ; bertuccio , my steward , takes me for a roman ; hayde e , my slave , thinks me a greek .: 65.39
<S> it will be a splendid session ! chapter 100 .: 44.72
<S> a pardon for peppino , called rocca priori , said the principal friar .: 66.90
<S> he must know where his master is ! without a doubt he must . d artagnan thought for a moment , then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out .: 37.85
<S> at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick , the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber .: 36.78
<S> what do you propose ? zounds !: 21.54
<S> come , parry , said the king , cease your tears . if it s parry , said the bishop , i have nothing to fear ; so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who i am and for what i am come . at this sight and this voice charles was about to cry out , when aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of england .: 36.76
<S> anne , said he , you are but a woman and as a woman you may insult men at your ease , knowing that you can do it with impunity .: 39.34
<S> my dear friends , said d artagnan , give your swords to monsieur mouston , who will return them to you at the proper time and place , and do not forget you are our prisoners . it was not long before they joined the escort .: 30.17
<S> d artagnan was conqueror without much effort , it must be confessed , for only one of the officers was armed , and even he defended himself for form s sake .: 61.79
<S> her ho tel was remarkably sumptuous , and while the most part of the english had quit , or were about to quit , france on account of the war , milady had just been laying out much money upon her residence ; which proved that the general measure which drove the english from france did not affect her .: 81.01
<S> oh , misery , oh , vanity ! you take it , however . yes , but i make hereby a vow in your presence , to employ all that remains to me in pious works . his face was pale and drawn , like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle .: 51.63
<S> is it not tempting what i offer you , and is it not an easy thing , since it is only to do thus ?: 28.76
<S> the minister of police , giving way to an impulse of despair , was about to throw himself at the feet of louis xviii. , who retreated a step and frowned .: 29.52
<S> but if they fire , all is lost ! cried d artagnan .: 26.44
<S> no , no , he said to the patron , i was awkward , and it is just that i pay the penalty of my clumsiness .: 28.13
<S> come , let me show you my plan . the abbe then showed dante s the sketch he had made for their escape .: 38.86
<S> napoleon , in the island of elba , is too near france , and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans .: 33.39
<S> as usual , a pilot put off immediately , and rounding the cha teau d if , got on board the vessel between cape morgiou and rion island .: 59.60
<S> then the iron hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast ; a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes , he bent his head and wept .: 51.52
<S> euge nie , continued the baroness , turning towards her daughter , this is the count of monte cristo . the count bowed , while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly .: 15.44
<S> a most affectionate greeting , as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter .: 57.00
<S> you have decided , friend ? said athos .: 24.22
<S> it is nearly eight o clock , and at nine i expect a visit .: 27.37
<S> where are your passports ? we have none ; we left england , ignorant of the state of politics here , having left paris before the departure of the king . ah ! said the sergeant , with a cunning smile , you are mazarinists , who are sent as spies . my dear friend , here athos spoke , rest assured , if we were mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport .: 38.95
<S> it is some time since we heard from his mistress , said athos , in a low voice .: 16.44
<S> bonacieux could not close his eyes ; not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable , but because his uneasiness was so great .: 59.04
<S> at the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks , and retired by the adjacent streets .: 42.48
<S> and she fell on her knees , at the same time holding me up towards heaven , as if she desired , while praying to god in my behalf , to raise me actually to his presence . and for the second time hayde e stopped , overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow , and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance , so parched and dry were her throat and lips .: 52.61
<S> before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks , that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion .: 98.69
<S> he then took his cane , which he had placed against an old cupboard , and went out .: 21.13
<S> come , tell me his name ! remember that his name is all my secret . yet i must know his name . yes , you must ; see what confidence i have in you ! you overwhelm me with joy .: 41.56
<S> come , speak , my worthy corsican , speak ! what do you wish me to say ? i will help you .: 17.04
<S> the two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the faubourg , but on arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of paris had become rivers , and the open places lakes ; after the great rains which fell in january the seine had overflowed its banks and the river inundated half the capital .: 76.01
<S> who is this caderousse ? some provenc al , it appears .: 84.77
<S> he was moistened before and behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive oil .: 86.19
<S> well , laporte ? asked the queen .: 11.20
<S> what do you think of the count ? inquired debray ; he is not much amiss , according to my ideas of good looks . the count , repeated euge nie , as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner ; the count ? oh , he is so dreadfully pale . i quite agree with you , said morcerf ; and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out .: 33.47
<S> the heart of the young man overflowed with joy .: 18.00
<S> the cardinal folded and sealed his letter .: 55.86
<S> besides these , a casket of magnificent goldwork , with the same arms as the sword and the portrait , formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece , and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture .: 53.33
<S> alas , replied he , it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lips .: 36.88
<S> milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance , and which so rarely failed of their effect ; anger made her eyes flash in the darkness .: 42.51
<S> knock , said the count , and announce me . bertuccio knocked , the door opened , and the concierge appeared .: 27.34
<S> section 5 .: 16.70
<S> now , what would you say to an ensign s commission in my guards , and a company after the campaign ? ah , monseigneur . you accept it , do you not ? monseigneur , replied d artagnan , with an embarrassed air .: 32.67
<S> but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dante s handled the helm .: 95.79
<S> they must disappear , broken , scattered , annihilated .: 86.32
<S> can we do anything for you ? asked athos .: 17.10
<S> well , i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in 1815 , that of not being able to call a day my own , not even that of my betrothal . and wherefore were you called away just now ? asked mademoiselle de saint me ran , with an air of deep interest .: 58.64
<S> this permission , we feel bound to say , was graciously granted ; which compels us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of letters .: 185.17
<S> mademoiselle valentine passed through the room to go to madame de villefort s , said he ; and in passing , as she was thirsty , she drank what remained in the glass ; as for the decanter , master edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks . noirtier raised his eyes to heaven , as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke .: 69.38
<S> tell me , therefore , who are these men who killed the son with despair , and the father with famine ? two men jealous of him , sir ; one from love , and the other from ambition , fernand and danglars . how was this jealousy manifested ?: 67.57
<S> however , he , like c sar borgia , knew the value of time ; and , in order to avoid fruitless toil , he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe , struck the earth with the butt of his gun , and finding nothing that appeared suspicious , returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard .: 63.33
<S> old pastrini , our former acquaintance , received the traveller at the door , hat in hand .: 53.25
<S> oh , you know it , tell them , tell them ! and the young man s voice was choked by sobs .: 19.79
<S> he was about to remove the pistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill , but he found the holsters furnished with similar pistols .: 44.62
<S> where is the count , friend ?: 22.05
<S> nevertheless , she remained motionless .: 19.93
<S> for you told me your father desired the marriage . it is my mother who dissents ; she has a clear and penetrating judgment , and does not smile on the proposed union .: 69.74
<S> blaisois , replied mousqueton , remember that bread is the true nourishment of a frenchman , who is not always able to get bread , ask grimaud . yes , but beer ? asked blaisois sharply , is that their true drink ? as to that , answered mousqueton , puzzled how to get out of the difficulty , i must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the english . what !: 73.46
<S> the count read it .: 20.51
<S> richelieu still continued thinking , rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands .: 104.41
<S> the door at length was opened , and a man appeared , of high stature , pale complexion , and black hair and beard .: 19.25
<S> eat heartily . grimaud smiled ; and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which athos held in his hand , he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed it .: 43.16
<S> he reflected for a second and then descended the stairs .: 32.79
<S> yes , said he , i came quickly ; i wanted to speak to you . are all your family well ? asked the count , with an affectionate benevolence , whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt .: 29.90
<S> debray , who was slightly disturbed at this visit , recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness , and took up a book marked by a mother of pearl knife inlaid with gold .: 50.18
<S> accordingly , it was admitted to the presence of anne , who , silent and lofty as ever , listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies ; but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say , so calm remained her face , whether or no she had heard them .: 76.29
<S> bazin gone , the mendicant cast a rapid glance around him in order to be sure that nobody could either see or hear him , and opening his ragged vest , badly held together by a leather strap , he began to rip the upper part of his doublet , from which he drew a letter .: 55.55
<S> upon my honor , this man fancies the world belongs to him .: 39.59
<S> it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life .: 32.07
<S> after supper , when they are perfected , i will communicate my plans to you . so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d artagnan s inventive imagination .: 65.64
<S> d artagnan , as we have said , had become more tranquil , as always happens after a past danger , particularly when the danger seems to have vanished .: 52.22
<S> of all this household , only two persons deserve our notice ; these are mademoiselle euge nie danglars and mademoiselle louise d armilly .: 97.36
<S> and besides , even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time ; it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle .: 58.40
<S> render to him , then , the last service he can by any possibility ask of you , and your work will be all the more meritorious . the monk made no reply , but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed .: 52.07
<S> m. d e pinay , to whom i had promised the interest of this sum , shall receive it , even if i endure the most cruel privations . however , said madame de villefort , returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind , perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m. d e pinay , in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort . ah , that would be a great pity , said villefort .: 30.05
<S> bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her ; she was like people who dream they are pursued , and who in vain try to walk .: 64.69
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> he looked again through his glass , but even then he could not distinguish anything .: 32.31
<S> oh , mon dieu !: 6.78
<S> i wished to live , said athos .: 10.81
<S> the carriage went on , and left the two men facing each other ; no material obstacle separated them .: 47.81
<S> follow him , said villefort to dante s .: 16.85
<S> i shall give him a good dinner , he will confide his son to my care , i will promise to watch over him , i shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him , and then i shall have done my part . certainly ; i see you are a model mentor , said albert good bye , we shall return on sunday .: 58.60
<S> the three friends were likewise greatly delighted .: 32.26
<S> a few seconds afterward d artagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak , which ill concealed the sheath of a long sword .: 46.45
<S> the servants , standing in the doorway , not daring to approach nearer , were looking at noirtier s old servant , who had heard the noise from his master s room , and run there also , remaining behind the others .: 43.71
<S> no , where i can confess . but perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think , said raoul .: 50.96
<S> look , fernand , your eyes are better than mine .: 53.61
<S> come in , my braves , said the king , come in ; i am going to scold you . the musketeers advanced , bowing , d artagnan following closely behind them .: 38.15
<S> when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had gone out about half an hour previously .: 23.93
<S> i will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them .: 36.94
<S> the hapless dante s was doomed .: 44.88
<S> ah , said he , you have remarked i must have been blind not to have seen . yes , said porthos , that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom i have great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband , and who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church , buried in this vile quarter , solely for the sake of seeing me . monsieur porthos , said the procurator s wife , will you have the kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes ?: 29.84
<S> my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open .: 58.29
<S> will this be permitted me ? certainly , replied the officer , and left the room .: 20.32
<S> i mean the russian prince , who you said had 30,000 livres , and we only found 22,000. you must have searched badly . luigi vampa himself searched . in that case he must either have paid his debts a russian do that ? or spent the money ? possibly , after all . certainly .: 128.25
<S> maximilian shuddered .: 40.10
<S> dante s might have waited until the evening visit was over , but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind , and order the dead body to be removed earlier .: 49.60
<S> ah , my dear fellow , excuse me ; i am lodged like a chartreux .: 25.12
<S> is he still amusing himself in italy ? i believe so ; however , he regrets your absence extremely .: 75.51
<S> d artagnan no longer doubted that this was porthos s pleasant dwelling place .: 42.45
<S> it would be very kind of you . no ; i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter . a serious matter , said the count , looking at franz with the earnestness usual to him ; and what may it be ? are we alone ? yes , replied the count , going to the door , and returning .: 25.92
<S> richelieu knew that in combating england he combated buckingham ; that in triumphing over england he triumphed over buckingham in short , that in humiliating england in the eyes of europe he humiliated buckingham in the eyes of the queen .: 172.99
<S> now , gentlemen , said athos , when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the ho tel , let everyone retire to his own apartment .: 38.19
<S> for god s sake , tell me , did you know this englishman ? but you tell me , also , that the house of thomson french have constantly denied having rendered you this service ? yes . then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who , grateful for a kindness your father had shown him , and which he himself had forgotten , has taken this method of requiting the obligation ? everything is possible in this affair , even a miracle . what was his name ? asked monte cristo .: 44.22
<S> at the moment when he was about to retire , she was cheered with a ray of hope , for she thought he was about to speak ; but his lips moved without any sound leaving his mouth , and making a powerful effort to control himself , he sent back to his heart the words that were about to escape from his lips , and went out .: 29.79
<S> as for monte cristo , his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude .: 24.52
<S> speak ; i will listen . in the first place , said milady , it is possible i may be deceived , and that d artagnan and his friends may really come to your assistance . oh , that would be too much ! cried mme .: 22.10
<S> faith , no , for between the culprit and the victim i have no choice . but i , cried morrel , groaning with sorrow , i love her ! you love ? whom ? cried monte cristo , starting to his feet , and seizing the two hands which morrel was raising towards heaven .: 46.20
<S> aramis affected a laugh , to divert the attention of certain curious listeners , and perceiving that athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there , he proceeded to join him , throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room .: 68.94
<S> be civil , or i shall beat you ; for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself , one insists on respect suitable to one s rank . you don t choose to discover yourself , because you are the leader of an ambuscade , returned d artagnan ; but with regard to myself , who am traveling quietly with my own servant , i have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my name . enough !: 75.70
<S> ah , maximilian , i may have much to suffer , but i feel as if my grandfather s look at that moment would more than compensate for all . dear valentine , you are a perfect angel , and i am sure i do not know what i sabring right and left among the bedouins can have done to merit your being revealed to me , unless , indeed , heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels .: 60.41
<S> at about a league and a half from the city , d artagnan , finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon , stopped to give the horses breathing time .: 52.31
<S> it is , then , buckingham ! cried felton , in a high state of excitement .: 21.38
<S> wait , said athos .: 11.96
<S> d arminges and olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses , and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin raoul and his companion .: 44.53
<S> athos followed the road for some time , his eyes fixed upon the ground ; slight stains of blood , which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier , or from one of the horses , dotted the road .: 48.91
<S> and should any misfortune occur to you , dear edmond , she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought , if misfortune should occur to you , i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it . fernand became deadly pale .: 71.63
<S> you ? cried she , with tones of thrilling tenderness , you are everywhere ! monte cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his , and was about to raise it to his lips , when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it , and presented her cheek .: 35.83
<S> my friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation , which makes my heart glad when i hear it . tis an illustrious name , said the lieutenant , and had one day triumphal honors paid to it . what do you mean , sir ? inquired raoul .: 48.71
<S> can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future ?: 52.55
<S> you are no longer in my service , monsieur bertuccio . oh , your excellency , your excellency ! cried the steward , struck with terror at this threat , if that is the only reason i can not remain in your service , i will tell all , for if i quit you , it will only be to go to the scaffold . that is different , replied monte cristo ; but if you intend to tell an untruth , reflect it were better not to speak at all . no , monsieur , i swear to you , by my hopes of salvation , i will tell you all , for the abbe busoni himself only knew a part of my secret ; but , i pray you , go away from that plane tree .: 24.39
<S> i confess i have seen nothing but the fire ; let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes .: 54.32
<S> the young girl looked at morrel .: 11.75
<S> thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history ; his terrible story is recited in the chimney corner , and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep . then , the count added aloud , was his name ever known ? oh , yes ; but only as no .: 74.32
<S> you come to demand money of me of a musketeer !: 69.14
<S> there is no hurry , you know .: 22.12
<S> sit down , my dear friend , and let us talk . and aramis pushed forward a large easy chair , in which d artagnan stretched himself out .: 26.26
<S> nevertheless , while acknowledging the truth of what he said , i thought proper to insist ; but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me , he took one of his pistols , laid it on his table , day and night , and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing , either within the house or out of it , he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself .: 46.89
<S> all this was incomprehensible , and then , with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news , the failure was put off until the end of september .: 43.01
<S> milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting , and this last offense has made the cup overflow . fortunately , added he , my good friends are down yonder , and they will not allow me to be carried away without a struggle .: 58.71
<S> it is not fernand mondego s treachery towards ali pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you , but the treachery of the fisherman fernand towards you , and the almost unheard of miseries which were its consequences ; and i say , and proclaim it publicly , that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father , and i , his son , thank you for not using greater severity . had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene , it would not have surprised them more than did albert s declaration .: 75.15
<S> is it thus you perform your charge , monsieur ? continued the king , without directly replying to de tre ville s question .: 45.34
<S> happily , i vanquished death .: 86.50
<S> in the meanwhile , as the thing is difficult to find in france , and your abbe is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account , i must continue to use monsieur planche s anti spasmodics ; and mint and hoffman s drops are among my favorite remedies .: 85.14
<S> i do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice . my dear d artagnan , replied aramis , you understand , when i was a musketeer i mounted guard as seldom as i could ; now when i am an abbe i say as few masses as i can .: 61.97
<S> arrived at the top stair , she turned round , and called out , in a warning tone , to her husband , gaspard , consider well what you are about to do ! i have both reflected and decided , answered he .: 58.76
<S> a positive feast ! cried m. coquenard , turning about in his chair , a real feast , epul epulorum .: 77.76
<S> i must stay and follow the advice of my hostess , while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition . he had just completed this monologue which proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue when the servant maid , watching at the door , suddenly cried out : ah !: 91.60
<S> but the count completely baffled the procureur , and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming .: 105.66
<S> change these lackeys , said he ; she has spoken to them .: 44.51
<S> every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations .: 54.18
<S> early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches , and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker .: 68.44
<S> the daughter of ali pasha ? of ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki . and your slave ? ma foi , yes . but how did she become so ? why , simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day , as i was passing through the market at constantinople . wonderful !: 58.56
<S> the plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted .: 82.24
<S> how was he going to find athos ?: 26.89
<S> i own i was seeking them . why , when all was arranged ? listen , count ; the affair is serious and unavoidable . did you doubt it ! no ; the offence was public , and everyone is already talking of it . well ? well , i hoped to get an exchange of arms , to substitute the sword for the pistol ; the pistol is blind . have you succeeded ? asked monte cristo quickly , with an imperceptible gleam of hope .: 48.28
<S> odds fish !: 204.67
<S> i then swore that this woman who had ruined him , who was more than his accomplice , since she had urged him to the crime , should at least share his punishment .: 44.85
<S> him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity . oh , said andrea , my father s old servant .: 67.00
<S> bonacieux saw that she had gone too far , and she was terrified at having communicated so much .: 38.58
<S> this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find d artagnan .: 42.66
<S> i have heard here and there that this sister in law was a hussy .: 62.47
<S> edward , said villefort , fixing an imperious glance on the child , go and play in the drawing room , my dear ; i wish to speak to your mamma . madame de villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance , that resolute tone , and the awfully strange preliminaries .: 32.74
<S> it is a mercy to let me die , for if i live i shall lose my reason and become mad .: 33.85
<S> at the corner of the street they met the count s steward , who was awaiting his master .: 14.39
<S> mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside .: 59.50
<S> and why separate ? asked athos .: 18.30
<S> come , d artagnan , don t let us play a sidelong game ; your hesitation , your evasion , tells me at once on whose side you are ; for that party no one dares openly to recruit , and when people recruit for it , it is with averted eyes and humble voice . ah !: 97.89
<S> contrary to custom , this gentleman had not been watched , for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank , and one who would allow no impertinent interference , his incognito was strictly respected .: 77.21
<S> i valued it much , said mazarin , giving a last look at it ; nevertheless , i give it to you with great pleasure . and i , my lord , said d artagnan , accept it as it is given .: 24.35
<S> he had therefore purchased a vault , which was quickly occupied by members of his family .: 47.63
<S> bazin wore his dress , it may be observed , with equal dignity and saintly propriety .: 94.63
<S> go on with your recital , sirs , said the queen , turning to the duc de chatillon .: 17.03
<S> it would be impossible to make use of a diligence , equally so to engage post horses ; to travel either way a passport was necessary .: 100.40
<S> there grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit pe re lachaise , or by lovers who make it their rendezvous .: 140.16
<S> what do i see ? that he wouldn t swear . swear what ? that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fight . and aramis wouldn t swear ? no . attention , then ! athos did not lose sight of the two speakers .: 40.59
<S> it was the count de rochefort .: 9.48
<S> then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were convinced .: 30.01
<S> you tried to kill her ; she is a woman to return you the like , and not to fail . she will not dare to say anything ; that would be to denounce herself . she is capable of anything or everything .: 46.97
<S> at this moment ali entered .: 12.80
<S> you are thoughtful , sir , continued morrel ; you want something ; shall i call one of the servants ? yes , replied noirtier .: 21.25
<S> god be praised !: 52.69
<S> her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance ; but , overpersuaded by the advice of her women , she at last had the appearance of beginning to forget .: 66.37
<S> we must be expeditious .: 38.15
<S> sir , said he , with compressed lips and flashing eyes , you have not the presumption to instruct the comte de la fere and myself what we ought to say here ? during this brief altercation athos , with his hands on his heart , his head bent low , approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow said : madame , princes who by nature are above other men receive from heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank , for their hearts are elevated as their fortunes .: 74.87
<S> lucien , said the baroness , i assure you i have no desire to sleep , and that i have a thousand things to tell you this evening , which you must listen to , even though you slept while hearing me . i am at your service , madame , replied lucien coldly .: 24.18
<S> one drop will restore life , as you have seen ; five or six will inevitably kill , and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as , poured into a glass of wine , it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor .: 67.13
<S> this fourth murder is apparent to all , and if thy father abandon thee , valentine , it is i , and i swear it , that shall pursue the assassin . and this time , as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame , nearly bursting with its own strength , the words of morrel were stifled in his throat ; his breast heaved ; the tears , so long rebellious , gushed from his eyes ; and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed .: 66.29
<S> sdeath !: 33.64
<S> i have now to confess to you .: 22.27
<S> he had not even the means for making a possible settlement on account .: 49.94
<S> although you say i do not like him , i assure you i shall be happy to see him . i will obey your orders , my lord . good bye . until saturday , when i may expect you , may i not ? yes , i promised you . the count watched albert , waving his hand to him .: 20.28
<S> doubtless ; it is said m. danglars conceals at least half of his fortune . and he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions , said andrea with a look sparkling with joy .: 56.61
<S> although athos was scarcely thirty years old , and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind , no one knew whether he had ever had a mistress .: 35.97
<S> one only chance was left me , that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abbe busoni , who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning .: 46.65
<S> julie and emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you .: 55.37
<S> the old man did not answer , but looked at his master with wild staring eyes , while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright .: 29.59
<S> he , he ! murmured she ; can it be he ? and she remained in bed with her eyes fixed .: 36.26
<S> why should we load ourselves with a useless burden ? i don t find a good musket , twelve cartridges , and a powder flask very useless in the face of an enemy . well , replied athos , have you not heard what d artagnan said ? what did he say ? demanded porthos .: 42.62
<S> they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word .: 17.52
<S> as to d artagnan , being at bottom a prudent youth , instead of returning home , went and dined with the gascon priest , who , at the time of the distress of the four friends , had given them a breakfast of chocolate .: 29.00
<S> i know an italian prince , rich as a gold mine , one of the noblest families in tuscany , who , when his sons married according to his wish , gave them millions ; and when they married against his consent , merely allowed them thirty crowns a month .: 64.72
<S> yes , why ? because , in the first place , they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking , then they bind the crew hand and foot , they attach to everyone s neck a four and twenty pound ball , a large hole is chopped in the vessel s bottom , and then they leave her .: 88.49
<S> what devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything !: 83.58
<S> monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards a small table , on which were arranged music , drawings , and vases of flowers .: 50.95
<S> dante s observed , however , that faria , in spite of the relief his society afforded , daily grew sadder ; one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind .: 108.02
<S> she stopped in the doorway , listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp , the only sound in that deserted room , and then advanced to the table to see if valentine s glass were empty .: 36.65
<S> this is the reason that , instead of the sixteen i had last year , i have this year , you see , eleven , already plucked twelve , thirteen , fourteen , fifteen , sixteen , seventeen , eighteen .: 56.87
<S> bonacieux re entered .: 39.18
<S> and now , my dear franz , let us talk of something else .: 12.35
<S> d artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter ; it was dated from the chateau du vallon .: 38.65
<S> you can not take me for a commonplace man , a mere rattle , emitting a vague and senseless noise .: 79.71
<S> now , then , what had i better do ? return instantly .: 41.78
<S> i do not then see why , without real necessity , i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion .: 43.07
<S> then , said d artagnan , letting his arm fall with discouragement , it is useless to struggle longer .: 34.84
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> until this day and for how long a time ! he had refrained from talking of the treasure , which had brought upon the abbe the accusation of madness .: 91.67
<S> they had expected maximilian since the previous evening .: 48.67
<S> a secret may , by chance , be betrayed by gentlemen ; but it is almost always sold by lackeys . porthos s plan appears to me to be impracticable , said d artagnan , inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you .: 65.39
<S> he is a bully and so am i ; his cassock is a burden to him and i imagine i have had enough of mine ; in fact , there is so much resemblance between us that i sometimes believe he is aramis and i am the coadjutor .: 60.28
<S> is the conference ended ? asked euge nie , rising .: 30.00
<S> if i have committed an additional crime , punish me , but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate has been sad , bitter , and lamentable , then pity me . but your mother ? asked the president .: 61.01
<S> d artagnan turned to porthos .: 15.74
<S> gondy , edged into a corner , saw them vanish from the first until the last but one .: 77.08
<S> on recognizing her step mother , valentine could not repress a shudder , which caused a vibration in the bed .: 76.82
<S> exactly ! replied mousqueton .: 29.56
<S> like all the great nobles of that period , athos rode and fenced to perfection .: 81.74
<S> come , then , on another occasion you can be firm and strong ; but to day is not the proper time ; to day , flatter and caress , or you are only a common woman . at the first words of this address d artagnan had seized porthos s arm , which he pressed with gradually increasing force .: 57.11
<S> but before madame de villefort could reach her friend , the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars , i must speak to you . when ? tomorrow . where ? in my office , or in the court , if you like , that is the surest place . i will be there . at this moment madame de villefort approached .: 33.61
<S> three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church !: 95.65
<S> bread and salt madame de morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion .: 84.66
<S> one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french , which he however wrote with great facility . the day after this important information had been given to the king s attorney , a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue fe rou , and rapping at an olive green door , asked if the abbe busoni were within .: 35.82
<S> i mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not , by her infamy , soil an unblemished name ; that she shall not , with one blow , dishonor her husband and her child . no , no oh , no ! well , madame , it will be a laudable action on your part , and i will thank you for it ! you will thank me for what ? for what you have just said . what did i say ?: 44.16
<S> he was my friend : he had no secrets from me , and if this had been so he would have confided in me . and he told you nothing ? not a word . nothing that would lead you to suppose ? nothing . and yet you spoke of him at once . ah , in such a case one supposes sister , sister , said maximilian , coming to the count s aid , monsieur is quite right .: 54.95
<S> well , then , we will put simply , my lord , do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared ? my dear d artagnan , you will never make anything but a very bad secretary .: 43.29
<S> we two are worth a dozen . yes , said porthos , smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits ; but we four , altogether , would be equal to thirty six , more especially as you say the work will not be child s play .: 61.45
<S> thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of charlemagne , in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model .: 109.36
<S> albert passed his hand through his hair , and curled his moustache , then , having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance , followed the count into the room , the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves .: 42.64
<S> and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian , who received him with great coldness .: 32.18
<S> i had speedy proofs that the excellent abbe was engaged in my behalf , for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences , and i was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held .: 68.33
<S> but no one entered except two or three marines , who brought her trunks and packages , deposited them in a corner , and retired without speaking .: 66.61
<S> i consult them when doubtful , and if i ever do any good , it is due to their beneficent counsels .: 107.42
<S> we will accompany them only to a little village in limousin , lying between tulle and angouleme a little village called roche l abeille . madame de chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise , and looked at athos with an expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile .: 41.63
<S> i am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years . then no misfortune has happened to you ? and what misfortune could happen to me ?: 42.63
<S> but you come from england .: 32.47
<S> the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light , and she disappeared .: 44.85
<S> i like to hear you speak thus , and i augur well for edmond from it . wait a moment , said villefort , turning over the leaves of a register ; i have it a sailor , who was about to marry a young catalan girl .: 45.01
<S> his lackey , who , by an unforeseen piece of ill luck , had quarreled with the officers , disguised as stable lads miserable scoundrel ! cried d artagnan , you were all in the plot , then !: 71.13
<S> faith , he said , in italian , as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals , faith , there s enough to pay five councillors of parliament , and two generals in paris .: 69.38
<S> when your turn comes , i shall have the honor to inform you of it .: 17.80
<S> the young man stopped suddenly , looked around him , and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars , under an arbor .: 39.51
<S> when he had sufficiently recovered himself , he said , it appears , then , that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone .: 36.26
<S> monte cristo allowed a short time to elapse , and then said : it is singular , baron , but the same idea came across me the first time i came here ; it looked so gloomy i should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands .: 52.60
<S> but first , said morrel , allow me , sir , to tell you who i am , how much i love mademoiselle valentine , and what are my designs respecting her . noirtier made a sign that he would listen .: 26.50
<S> mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence , but continued to compassionate the fate of concino concini .: 62.06
<S> with five thousand you can buy a pretty little house with two acres of land ; the remaining twenty thousand will bring you in a thousand francs a year . a garden with two acres of land ! and a thousand francs a year . oh , heavens ! come , take them , and monte cristo forced the bank notes into his hand .: 39.96
<S> here he is . a man of about forty five or fifty entered , exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced franz into the cavern ; but he did not appear to recognize him .: 45.93
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> god doubtless neither heard nor saw me , and i sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death .: 89.27
<S> well done , guitant , cried the cardinal to the equestrian ; i see plainly that , notwithstanding the sixty four years that have passed over your head , you are still the same man , active and zealous .: 53.08
<S> we make in our case a deposit , on a mortgage , which is an advance , as you see , since we gain at least ten , fifteen , twenty , or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our money .: 47.42
<S> if it but lasts , most capital , responded porthos .: 114.30
<S> day came ; the table had disappeared , only i had still the knife in my hand .: 65.66
<S> hey !: 27.97
<S> what brings you to paris ? affairs of importance which you shall know later .: 87.94
<S> precisely so , replied gaetano .: 53.18
<S> wrapped in this sweet idea , d artagnan waited half an hour without the least impatience , his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings , attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment .: 48.64
<S> my father has revealed the culprit s name ; my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do , yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret .: 72.60
<S> what i have done , then , has been for the queen , and not at all for your grace .: 26.92
<S> but , it is well known , what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is not always what affects the mass of readers .: 60.17
<S> to be a bishop ? aramis , answered d artagnan , who did not wish to undeceive porthos , aramis , fancy , has become a monk and a jesuit , and lives like a bear .: 51.83
<S> now let us return to your particular world .: 44.87
<S> de villefort , replied the doctor , with increased vehemence , there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection .: 64.71
<S> ali , observed his master , as the nubian entered the chamber , you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso , have you not ? ali drew himself up proudly , and then returned a sign in the affirmative .: 66.01
<S> but , said d artagnan , in the ear of athos , you are going to get us all killed without mercy . we are much more likely to be killed , said athos , if we do not go . my faith , gentlemen , said porthos , turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache , that s a fair bet , i hope . i take it , said m. de busigny ; so let us fix the stake . you are four gentlemen , said athos , and we are four ; an unlimited dinner for eight .: 28.24
<S> as for andrea , he was launched , and when he was once launched nothing stopped him .: 37.68
<S> roman bandits the next morning franz woke first , and instantly rang the bell .: 90.26
<S> but wait a moment , do not let us get angry , or at least not yet .: 32.67
<S> i enclose a draft for 5,000 livres , payable on m. ferrea , banker at nice , and also a letter of introduction to the count of monte cristo , whom i have directed to supply all your wants .: 38.48
<S> i can not speak latin , responded the marquise .: 23.96
<S> the young girl perfectly understood the look , and so did villefort , for his countenance became clouded , and he knitted his eyebrows angrily .: 51.99
<S> now that never happened to us when we were four together .: 35.88
<S> now that i have the word of athos i can set out . d artagnan started alone on his journey , without other escort than his sword , and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queen s presence .: 41.57
<S> are we not their majesties servants ? at that moment porthos entered .: 26.36
<S> is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself ?: 39.68
<S> i took him to the rue payenne , to exactly the same spot where , a year before , at the very same hour , he had paid me the compliment i have related to you .: 33.33
<S> our be arnais was a prudent lad , however young he might be .: 155.39
<S> the queen has not only one son , but two ; then , monsieur de coligny was killed , and yes , said mazarin , but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal ! no , my lord , but he will be , answered the guard .: 37.61
<S> this feeling lasted but for a moment .: 40.99
<S> whether queens or not , they are always the same . do you disapprove of this journey , my dear m. d artagnan ? asked mazarin , anxiously .: 35.31
<S> he had entered villefort s office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him ; on the contrary , he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk , and his head leaning on his hand .: 36.26
<S> this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure .: 74.24
<S> come , come , calm yourself , my sweet girl !: 14.68
<S> only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas . what are they ? sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution , on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons , their crimes , and mode of punishment .: 74.65
<S> from la rochelle ; and you ? from england . buckingham ? dead or desperately wounded , as i left without having been able to hear anything of him .: 63.43
<S> the count received him with his habitual smile .: 12.73
<S> he did not wait long , for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume .: 57.10
<S> the work of revolt continued the whole night thus .: 89.62
<S> one of the persons whose conversation i overheard was the master of the house ; the other , the physician .: 38.16
<S> this accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes .: 83.25
<S> i have an idea , said d artagnan .: 6.72
<S> i see you no longer i am dying help me !: 38.65
<S> what a confounded country this england is !: 109.12
<S> d artagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt ; then both mounted and departed quietly .: 42.01
<S> do you see ? whispered aramis to athos , touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the gascon wore under his belt .: 36.21
<S> come , come , said the old man , be comforted , my poor child ; there is still hope ! hope ! repeated danglars .: 26.36
<S> he held a vial of salts in his hand .: 20.89
<S> on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of euge nie and the arrest of benedetto , villefort having retired as well as noirtier and d avrigny , her thoughts wandered in a confused maze , alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard .: 53.48
<S> remain here , fasten the door inside , and open it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this ; and he tapped thrice two taps close together and pretty hard , the other after an interval , and lighter .: 113.03
<S> how hot you look , my good barrois , said valentine .: 39.60
<S> what are you waiting for ? said caderousse .: 10.87
<S> and you are afraid i shall be unhappy ? yes . you do not like m. franz ? the eyes repeated several times , no , no , no . then you are vexed with the engagement ? yes . well , listen , said valentine , throwing herself on her knees , and putting her arm round her grandfather s neck , i am vexed , too , for i do not love m. franz d e pinay . an expression of intense joy illumined the old man s eyes .: 21.85
<S> d artagnan ! cried she , is it you ?: 16.46
<S> or , having delivered you , make you sign a flaming parchment , surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth right ? rail on , rail on at your ease , gentlemen , said morcerf , somewhat piqued .: 123.21
<S> the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit , and that he desired another under the same conditions .: 76.75
<S> spada died on the threshold of the vineyard ; the nephew expired at his own door , making signs which his wife could not comprehend .: 73.08
<S> you will find him quite enthusiastic . upon what subject ? asked madame danglars .: 23.79
<S> the young man stood before her , sorrowful and resolute .: 23.58
<S> the two friends looked to the right , to the left ; they were encompassed by a troop of horsemen .: 21.31
<S> and desirous of putting an end to the interview , he pushed by her , and closed the door , as if to exclude the pain he felt .: 35.82
<S> i think madame danglars again requires your bottle , he said .: 39.35
<S> i dislike these quarrels among men of the church . gondy withdrew , distributing benedictions on his way , and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet .: 76.60
<S> thou man of noble heart ; woe is me !: 172.77
<S> for what purpose ? upon my honor , i will instantly return it to you .: 26.27
<S> d artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace , but it was not so .: 43.36
<S> now , this point was settled ; mme .: 43.35
<S> bertuccio made amends , however , by loading the antechambers , staircases , and mantle pieces with flowers .: 79.78
<S> this was albert s favorite lounging place .: 70.59
<S> twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides , without effect ; sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth .: 203.26
<S> hola , aramis !: 45.66
<S> franz continued : it was , as we said , the fifth of february .: 26.57
<S> on her side , milady tried to encourage felton in his project ; but at the first words which issued from her mouth , she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged .: 76.93
<S> impossible ! said d artagnan ; those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward .: 40.84
<S> kitty went to her mistress , and did not leave the door open ; but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two women .: 38.35
<S> poor things ! here i am in their name , said m. de boville ; but did you receive my letter yesterday ? yes . i have brought my receipt . 50111m my dear m. de boville , your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twenty four hours , since m. de monte cristo whom you just saw leaving here you did see him , i think ? yes ; well ? well , m. de monte cristo has just carried off their five millions . how so ? the count has an unlimited credit upon me ; a credit opened by thomson french , of rome ; he came to demand five millions at once , which i paid him with checks on the bank .: 56.15
<S> it is very hot , said athos , drawing his sword in its turn , and yet i can not take off my doublet ; for i just now felt my wound begin to bleed again , and i should not like to annoy monsieur with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself . that is true , monsieur , replied d artagnan , and whether drawn by myself or another , i assure you i shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman .: 42.53
<S> any why not this evening ? this evening , monsieur , i am detained in paris by indispensable business . ah , young man , young man , some flirtation or other .: 67.82
<S> yes , sire , in solitary confinement , in a dungeon , like the lowest criminal . the devil ! murmured the king ; what must be done ? sign an order for his release , and all will be said , replied the cardinal .: 36.10
<S> he has , at the request of your father , opened an account of 5,000 francs a month at m. danglars , which is one of the safest banks in paris . and does my father mean to remain long in paris ? asked andrea .: 26.15
<S> but now her position in life is assured , continued caderousse ; no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her ; she is rich , a countess , and yet caderousse paused .: 79.19
<S> the queen might be as much injured by too much reticence as by too much confidence ; and let us admit it the involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young protector decided her to speak .: 84.66
<S> tomorrow , perhaps , he may change you .: 63.03
<S> upon my word , said caderousse , from whose mind the friendly treatment of dante s , united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of , had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dante s good fortune , upon my word , dante s is a downright good fellow , and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be .: 56.63
<S> only they sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested , the instant that he left the trenches , to come to the quarters of the musketeers .: 48.80
<S> four in the king s room , two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered .: 43.92
<S> some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages .: 20.10
<S> make less hubbub and think more deeply .: 267.98
<S> recollect what i told you when you asked me to propose you .: 35.48
<S> swear to me , then , never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the crown .: 45.09
<S> d artagnan , equally moved , pressed him also closely to him , whilst tears stood in his eyes .: 53.50
<S> the next day , just as debray was signing the deed , that is about five o clock in the afternoon , madame de morcerf , after having affectionately embraced her son , entered the coupe of the diligence , which closed upon her .: 35.45
<S> you went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance ; they weighed heavily upon your stomach ; you had the nightmare that s all .: 82.26
<S> what is it you want , dear grandpapa ? said valentine , and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need ; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind , she repeated them aloud , then , finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant no , she said , come , since this plan does not answer , i will have recourse to another . she then recited all the letters of the alphabet from a down to n. when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted .: 58.53
<S> i have but exchanged with him one look , yet that look convinced me that we were doomed . the truth is , i m very sorry that i did not strangle him as you advised me , said porthos .: 43.88
<S> if they ask it what have i to say ? that is true , murmured mazarin , in a low tone , but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it , must i not ? and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again .: 46.60
<S> madame is searching for you everywhere ; there is a visitor in the drawing room . a visitor ? inquired valentine , much agitated ; who is it ? some grand personage a prince i believe they said the count of monte cristo . i will come directly , cried valentine aloud .: 53.50
<S> good heaven !: 32.46
<S> each of them , when the other was not looking , hazarded a sly glance .: 55.92
<S> athos surmised what had taken place and smiled .: 52.05
<S> general information about project gutenberg electronic works professor michael s. hart was the originator of the project gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone .: 10.30
<S> s. go to the king s treasurer , at blois ; tell him your name and show him this letter ; you will receive two hundred pistoles . assuredly , said d artagnan , i admire this piece of prose .: 39.28
<S> and m. bonacieux , whom d artagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers , denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him ?: 37.90
<S> because it has instilled a new passion in your heart that of vengeance . dante s smiled .: 52.13
<S> it was even told me that fernand , especially , was terrible in his vengeance . fernand smiled piteously .: 74.32
<S> then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity .: 36.34
<S> it appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple thing .: 21.75
<S> at length , the long desired sound was heard , and instead of one figure , as he had expected , he perceived that two were approaching him .: 29.32
<S> the friends went to bed early , but neither of them slept .: 45.05
<S> i request , then , that planchet may be chosen , more particularly as he has already been to london with me , and knows how to speak correctly : london , sir , if you please , and my master , lord d artagnan .: 42.42
<S> she believed the order ready for execution .: 83.82
<S> indeed , m. beauchamp , it is quite laughable . yet , replied beauchamp haughtily , there are occasions when probity commands m .: 109.83
<S> m. morrel unhappy ? exclaimed the abbe .: 58.45
<S> what , said he , is it you , my dear franz , whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed ? no , not i , replied franz , but our neighbor , the count of monte cristo . oh , my dear count , said albert gayly , arranging his cravat and wristbands , you are really most kind , and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you , in the first place for the carriage , and in the next for this visit , and he put out his hand to the count , who shuddered as he gave his own , but who nevertheless did give it .: 30.70
<S> dante s saw that he must attack the wedge .: 36.96
<S> the island of monte cristo chapter 24 .: 10.58
<S> excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum i am in the habit of carrying in my pocket book or dressing case . and with these words monte cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visiting cards , and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500,000 francs each , payable at sight to the bearer .: 66.40
<S> the man whom athos had come so far to seek , and whom he had found with so much trouble , introduced him into his laboratory , where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a skeleton .: 40.19
<S> the sentinel who was relieved at six o clock in the morning , remembered perfectly that , just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four , a young man arrived on horseback , with a little boy before him .: 31.45
<S> plan of campaign d artagnan went straight to m. de tre ville s .: 24.92
<S> pray excuse me , madame , replied monte cristo , but i never eat muscatel grapes . merce de s let them fall , and sighed .: 22.73
<S> although , said villefort , it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her grandfather s fortune , i do not think that m. d e pinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss .: 27.16
<S> do you again defy me ? no ; the fact is , i have found my father . what ?: 23.41
<S> unfortunately , i had not above 1,500 .: 77.56
<S> he drew portraits , with a piece of coal , of the cardinal ; and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness , he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original : portrait of the illustrious coxcomb , mazarin . monsieur de chavigny , the governor of vincennes , waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way , or that at all events , if he drew likenesses , he would not put mottoes underneath them .: 66.40
<S> well , then , said d artagnan , gaily , let us sell the diamond , and say no more about it . the fusillade continued ; but the four friends were out of reach , and the rochellais only fired to appease their consciences .: 25.80
<S> rene e regarded him with fond affection ; and certainly his handsome features , lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation , seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover .: 94.31
<S> and how , said harrison , laughing , did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you ? in a very simple manner , colonel , said d artagnan .: 43.33
<S> he raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste , something like preserved angelica , but which was perfectly unknown to him .: 70.64
<S> he bowed respectfully to the king , who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception , but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which , from his infancy , louis xiv .: 51.49
<S> he called porthos to look at it .: 28.86
<S> at first , athos supported the association for a time with his own means .: 44.03
<S> sir , said d artagnan , you will go and release your companion , who is guarding the coachman .: 24.94
<S> as to my orders , since every one gives his own commands in our party , i shall end , if this goes on , by giving none at all . in short , my lord , said athos , glancing at aramis , your highness is discontented with your party ? discontented , sir !: 51.87
<S> no sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in it , and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor , in his turn , was snoring immoderately .: 58.45
<S> look , i shall turn to the left , so that the soldier will be at your right , as soon as he mounts on the bench to talk to us . but supposing he doesn t mount ? he will ; rely upon it .: 45.66
<S> exceedingly , replied franz .: 35.24
<S> what is he going to do ? thought villefort , whose position demanded much reserve , but who was longing to know what his father s intentions were .: 56.23
<S> how fine it is to be called conde and to be so worthy of such a name ! he was calm and radiant , was he not ? as calm as at parade , radiant as at a fete .: 52.77
<S> besides , said aramis , god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner . amen ! said athos , and we will return to that subject later , if such be your pleasure ; but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly , and i am sure you will understand me , d artagnan , was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal , and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us . but this creature must be a demon ! said porthos , holding out his plate to aramis , who was cutting up a fowl .: 59.58
<S> from this point everything was a blank to dante s he knew nothing more , not even the length of time he had been imprisoned .: 44.55
<S> the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris .: 25.35
<S> i shall hide myself in your cabin .: 43.57
<S> ah , he is not a man like that cursed d artagnan .: 18.54
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> let us see , said d artagnan .: 4.74
<S> on the sixth day , the smugglers returned .: 29.44
<S> she only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm the fair round arm of a woman but twenty five years old , and who yet spread death around her .: 72.30
<S> i have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write . they then separated .: 79.23
<S> well , here are 8,000 francs on account . the major s eyes sparkled brilliantly .: 28.43
<S> the lemonade chapter 80 .: 32.37
<S> my fault ? said he ; you must be mad !: 30.59
<S> listen , said he ; i have not the strength of mind you have , or rather that which you would not have , if instead of my daughter valentine your daughter madeleine were concerned . the doctor turned pale .: 36.71
<S> what did your father tell you , m. morrel ? said he eagerly .: 16.97
<S> the cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage ; but d artagnan , whose anger , already excited , was much increased by recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of athos , caught at his bridle and stopped him .: 66.13
<S> where is valentine , sir ?: 25.90
<S> thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are , perhaps , the cause of it ; but , wait , wait !: 44.92
<S> when , the day after the arrival of this answer , your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughter s hand for you , i decidedly refused him , but without any explanation or exposure .: 40.01
<S> then she suddenly cried , oh , no , no ! rising and retreating to the very wall .: 35.71
<S> i deserted the church for the world , for you know that i forced myself when i became a musketeer . i ?: 57.84
<S> we are for the king and the princes , added athos .: 23.21
<S> d artagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd , but very easily understood by that chosen regiment , the flower of the army .: 50.60
<S> it is useless , then , to attempt anything with him .: 22.01
<S> the fifth of october it was about six o clock in the evening ; an opal colored light , through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays , descended on the blue ocean .: 35.03
<S> do you understand it now ? athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration , ran to a closet and drew forth workmen s clothes , which the four friends immediately put on ; they then left the hotel , athos carrying a saw , porthos a vise , aramis an axe and d artagnan a hammer and some nails .: 66.74
<S> tomorrow , this evening , perhaps , i shall see him again ; and then the past will no longer exist . this evening ? asked milady , roused from her reverie by these words .: 34.81
<S> the servants had just disappeared under the trees , followed by the tutor , and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off .: 25.82
<S> what shall we do ? what are we going to do , i faith ?: 21.43
<S> and so , as we have said , the iron gate leading into the kitchen garden had been closed up and left to the rust , which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges , while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion , the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet .: 61.38
<S> yes , you are right , maximilian , i will follow you .: 9.46
<S> he left there three men .: 52.65
<S> come , gentlemen , cried harrison , regardless of his illustrious captive , let us be off . where do we sleep , colonel ? at thirsk , replied harrison .: 42.59
<S> the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground , bathed in a pool of blood .: 24.93
<S> meanwhile , she is not very wretched ; what she most desires is a letter from her intended .: 67.35
<S> until to morrow evening you are not at your own disposal . let it be then the day after to morrow , said aramis .: 36.33
<S> the count perceived at one glance madame danglars at one end of the drawing room , m. danglars at the other , and euge nie in front of him .: 31.47
<S> he bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of a shirt , which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison , and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet .: 88.39
<S> old dante s was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond .: 41.69
<S> have you , then , who have calculated everything with such nicety , have you forgotten to calculate one thing i mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to ?: 56.57
<S> what s the knot for ? thought dante s .: 50.16
<S> the banker uttered a groan and followed his guide ; he neither supplicated nor exclaimed .: 87.70
<S> but you , my dear d artagnan ? what can you expect , my dear porthos ; a man is not privileged in all ways , said d artagnan .: 19.38
<S> teresa and luigi reached the summit , and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits .: 54.61
<S> that is very annoying , said the brigadier ; for the man we are looking for is the chief . cucumetto ? cried luigi and teresa at the same moment .: 32.02
<S> thanks , monsieur bonacieux , said d artagnan , emptying his glass , that is all i wanted of you .: 16.61
<S> the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice milady s condescension .: 31.08
<S> he followed with his eye each movement of teresa and her cavalier ; when their hands touched , he felt as though he should swoon ; every pulse beat with violence , and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears .: 86.10
<S> one of her conditions was that she should come and see me twice a week ; for , as i had the honor to tell you , my wife loves me dearly my wife , then , came and confided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great fears . truly ! yes .: 48.25
<S> in a second de guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage .: 49.50
<S> yes ; i hope so , at least .: 16.21
<S> listen you know if i may be relied on . yes , said caderousse .: 39.07
<S> and do you know whither he went ? no , not precisely ; however , i think it was something very like a rendezvous . diavolo ! said the duke , this is a bad day , or rather a bad night , to be out late ; is it not , countess ? these words were addressed to the countess g , who had just arrived , and was leaning on the arm of signor torlonia , the duke s brother .: 31.89
<S> if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement , you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg electronic works in your possession .: 11.53
<S> i must have wronged you in some way at marseilles .: 31.77
<S> the four old friends prepare to meet again .: 64.69
<S> he turned and saw julie .: 33.32
<S> this was because his love , so strange , so new , and so ardent , made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of milady de winter as , through a magnifying glass , one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant .: 131.93
<S> if i were but learned in theology i should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits , when we were at crevecoeur ; i should know what doctrine he leans to and i should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his patron .: 85.34
<S> as for the remission of your sins , we have the archbishop of paris , who has the very greatest power at the court of rome , and even the coadjutor , who possesses some plenary indulgences ; we will recommend you to him . consider , maillard , said the curate , that i have recommended you to this gentleman , who is a powerful lord , and that i have made myself responsible for you . i know , monsieur le cure , said the beggar , that you have always been very kind to me , and therefore i , in my turn , will be serviceable to you . and do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cure told me it was just now ? i think they have some esteem for me , said the mendicant with pride , and that not only will they obey me , but wherever i go they will follow me . and could you count on fifty resolute men , good , unemployed , but active souls , brawlers , capable of bringing down the walls of the palais royal by crying , down with mazarin , as fell those at jericho ? i think , said the beggar , i can undertake things more difficult and more important than that . ah , ah , said gondy , you will undertake , then , some night , to throw up some ten barricades ? i will undertake to throw up fifty , and when the day comes , to defend them . i faith ! exclaimed gondy , you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure ; and since monsieur le cure can answer for you i answer for him , said the curate .: 48.86
<S> let us be the avant guard , said he to porthos , and find good quarters at saint germain ; nobody will think of us , and for my part i am greatly fatigued . as for me , replied porthos , i am falling asleep , which is strange , considering we have not had any fighting ; truly the parisians are idiots . or rather , we are very clever , said d artagnan .: 38.08
<S> the orders came .: 36.29
<S> planchet went down into the yard , and wished to saddle the horses ; but the horses were all used up .: 36.56
<S> the rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former days .: 49.63
<S> on arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the capital .: 39.56
<S> the jailer , though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering , was yet a man .: 55.06
<S> but a man , were he even a mercer , when he had talked for ten minutes with cardinal richelieu , is no longer the same man .: 53.12
<S> no ; it is in my arms and shoulders , answered porthos with gratified naivete .: 50.22
<S> madame morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers , julie still lay with her head on his shoulder , emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between morrel s family and the sailors at the door .: 38.66
<S> and rally to the old cry of france , montjoy and st. denis ! the war cry of england is too often in the mouths of traitors . they mounted the king on winter s horse and winter on that of the king ; then winter took his place at the head of the first squadron , and the king , with athos on his right and aramis on his left , at the head of the second .: 59.15
<S> however , the struggle still continued , and it was dreadful to witness .: 55.27
<S> the cardinal accompanied his majesty from surge res to mauzes ; and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of friendship .: 87.96
<S> during the evening two men , engaged for the purpose , had carried noirtier from valentine s room into his own , and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child .: 50.71
<S> if i am caught , i risk nothing but being taken back again to prison .: 46.99
<S> what are your excellency s orders ? inquired gaetano .: 19.21
<S> grimaud speaks .: 77.41
<S> her opera glass was so fixedly directed towards them , that franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity ; and , availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres , who use their boxes to hold receptions , the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess .: 51.62
<S> you will have the more time to learn to draw it only when it ought to be used . sir , replied raoul , putting the sword to his lips as he received it from the count , i owe you everything and yet this sword is the most precious gift you have yet made me .: 41.98
<S> it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter .: 22.60
<S> but i recollect perfectly one thing , that , being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep , i wished to try upon the arabs the new pistols that had been given to me .: 53.84
<S> however , we shall see .: 21.49
<S> act , then , as you think proper ; there is still time to withdraw . no , monsieur , no ; you appear to be an honest young man , and i will have confidence in you .: 26.43
<S> but merce de s did not witness his departure , although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dante s .: 21.64
<S> before the entrance of the magistrates , and indeed frequently afterwards , a court of justice , on days when some especial trial is to take place , resembles a drawing room where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats ; or , if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers , communicate by signs .: 101.59
<S> he was very successful upon that question .: 48.95
<S> ah , i remember , athos is at monsieur de tre ville s. but where are you going , monsieur , where are you going ? i am going down by the window , in order to be there the sooner , cried d artagnan .: 21.29
<S> then , when they had finished , they cast the earth over the corpse , until the grave was filled .: 26.73
<S> the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened .: 39.21
<S> the betrothed had retired , as we said , with haughty air , disdainful lip , and the demeanor of an outraged queen , followed by her companion , who was paler and more disturbed than herself .: 38.84
<S> all these he bequeathed to me , with a thousand roman crowns , which he had in ready money , on condition that i would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul , and that i would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house .: 56.61
<S> the steward gave him a gun ; this was what vampa longed for .: 57.23
<S> nay , further , have you never endeavored to recall the time , place , and circumstances of your former intercourse , and failing in this attempt , have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present , and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past ? yes . well , that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man . extraordinary , did you say ? yes . you have known him for some time , then ? scarcely longer than eight or ten days . and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days ?: 64.46
<S> that was all .: 17.20
<S> you are surprised at what you see here ? extremely . but above all things , i am a marvel to you ? i confess it . i am still young , am i not ?: 48.52
<S> yes , the porter . my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house . well ? the house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise . by whom ? by thieves . you are a fool , m. baptistin .: 49.05
<S> there you must rest ; young people are such braggarts . it was easy to see that olivain had not been taught in the school of the planchets and the grimauds .: 56.83
<S> d artagnan shows himself chapter x .: 58.42
<S> athos raised his sword ; d artagnan lowered his .: 34.95
<S> do you understand me ? perfectly ; you pledge me for three millions , do you not ? the greater the amount , the more flattering it is to you ; it gives you an idea of your value . thank you .: 34.00
<S> the three presents of d artagnan the elder chapter ii .: 17.89
<S> d artagnan mounted the box , having a pair of pistols in his belt , a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him .: 26.42
<S> say i am condemned , sir , if you please ; but you know that god , who loves martyrs , sometimes permits the innocent to be condemned . were you condemned , were you innocent , were you a martyr , replied felton , the greater would be the necessity for prayer ; and i myself would aid you with my prayers . oh , you are a just man ! cried milady , throwing herself at his feet .: 38.46
<S> did she stay long there ? an hour and a half . did she return home ? directly . well , my dear bertuccio , said the count , i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy . bertuccio bowed , and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received , he started the same evening .: 40.87
<S> if he closed his eyes , he saw cardinal spada s letter written on the wall in characters of flame if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain .: 80.79
<S> no , not that way , i beg , sir , quickly exclaimed the cardinal , be so good as to pass by yonder gallery , by which you can regain the hall .: 54.86
<S> loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together .: 175.50
<S> it was , indeed , the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass , and which valentine had drunk ; it was indeed the poison , which could not deceive m. d avrigny , which he now examined so closely ; it was doubtless a miracle from heaven , that , notwithstanding her precautions , there should be some trace , some proof remaining to reveal the crime .: 54.55
<S> signor luigi , continued albert , is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your excellency ? none , sir , replied the bandit , you are as free as air . well , then , a happy and merry life to you .: 49.04
<S> where is providence ? my son , replied the bishop , with firmness , you see him not , because the passions of the world conceal him . my son , said the king to aramis , do not take it so to heart .: 39.28
<S> the glance was of sublime eloquence .: 54.82
<S> my dear m. de villefort , replied the doctor , with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man , i have not led you here to console you ; on the contrary what can you mean ? asked the procureur , alarmed .: 19.45
<S> he walked straight into the midst of the guards , who on seeing him were silent .: 22.02
<S> i had about a million in their hands , but , warned in time , i withdrew it a month ago . ah , mon dieu ! exclaimed danglars , they have drawn on me for 200,000 francs ! well , you can throw out the draft ; their signature is worth five per cent . yes , but it is too late , said danglars , i have honored their bills . then , said monte cristo , here are 200,000 francs gone after hush , do not mention these things , said danglars ; then , approaching monte cristo , he added , especially before young m. cavalcanti ; after which he smiled , and turned towards the young man in question .: 35.52
<S> you shall have as much again if you are back within six days , and have executed your commission well . the messenger , without replying a single word , bowed , took the letter , with the order for the two hundred pistoles , and retired .: 38.03
<S> guides are useful people , who will turn their hands to anything .: 140.76
<S> edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man , and then the party , lighted by the man with the torch , who went first , ascended the stairs .: 34.27
<S> i thought i recognized him and i was not mistaken . whom do you mean ? asked aramis .: 14.17
<S> you do not believe in god when he is striking you dead ?: 65.30
<S> while monte cristo had begged the smelling bottle of madame de villefort , he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars , and he soon guessed all that had passed between them , though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars .: 28.74
<S> a quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal .: 15.15
<S> the four others were french and wore the uniform of musketeers . their names ? asked the monk .: 40.65
<S> what are your grandmother s symptoms ? an extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep ; she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her body , which she at the same time watched .: 68.71
<S> while waiting , the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house , the garden as far as he could distinguish it , and the livery of servants who passed to and fro , with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent .: 47.45
<S> you shall take half the sum that will be advanced upon it , or i will throw it into the seine ; and i doubt , as was the case with polycrates , whether any fish will be sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us . well , i will take it , then , said d artagnan .: 37.61
<S> porthos drew his sword from the scabbard , and made passes at the wall , springing back from time to time , and making contortions like a dancer .: 47.80
<S> the company was then heard departing ; then the door of the closet in which d artagnan was , was opened , and mme .: 36.05
<S> the vicomte de bragelonne , who will have the honor of remitting this letter to your majesty , is the friend of my son , who owes to him his life ; he is a gentleman in whom your majesty may confide entirely , in case your majesty may have some verbal or written order to remit to me .: 33.60
<S> without divulging his secret , dante s could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent .: 99.92
<S> danglars thought dentro la testa meant , put in your head ! he was making rapid progress in italian .: 189.99
<S> can you , sir , produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted ? alas , no , monsieur , replied the count ; all those who surrounded the vizier , or who knew me at his court , are either dead or gone away , i know not where .: 54.73
<S> finally milady stopped , and a bitter smile passed over her lips .: 20.99
<S> and she resumed her seat , as if plunged in reflections entirely personal .: 86.92
<S> a learned italian chapter 17 .: 66.60
<S> why , my dear fellow , that on leaving us he lost his way , that s all .: 26.27
<S> i thought i had quite , said groslow .: 32.19
<S> he reminded me of it , telling me if i did not pay for you , he would be paid by m. morrel ; and so , you see , lest he might do you an injury well ? why , i paid him . but , cried dante s , it was a hundred and forty francs i owed caderousse . yes , stammered the old man .: 32.49
<S> madame danglars and euge nie were going out at that moment ; they heard the cause of the disturbance .: 30.03
<S> i can not bear duelling ever since two seconds , whom i had chosen to arrange an affair , forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends , one whom you all know poor franz d e pinay . ah , true , said debray , you did fight some time ago ; about what ? 20235m the devil take me , if i remember , returned cha teau renaud .: 51.01
<S> the escape was fixed to take place at seven o clock ; there was therefore three quarters of an hour to wait .: 27.85
<S> what is it , then ? mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance .: 23.60
<S> go out this way , said she , opening a small private door , and come back at eleven o clock ; we will then terminate this conversation .: 33.50
<S> milady wished to please the abbess .: 32.60
<S> she cast a glance at the door ; the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating .: 30.59
<S> it is ali ! cried albert , in the midst of the general surprise .: 20.06
<S> the devil take this gout ! athos and aramis took their leave , but even in the ante chamber they could still hear the duke s cries ; he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned .: 39.60
<S> from a distance dante s recognized the rig and handling of la jeune ame lie , and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landing place , he met his companions with an assurance that , although considerably better than when they quitted him , he still suffered acutely from his late accident .: 64.67
<S> excuse me , sir , said baptistin , who had followed his master with indescribable terror , but i think i see a carriage down there under the trees . monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage , and offered his hand to assist emmanuel and maximilian .: 27.43
<S> in which we hear tidings of aramis .: 52.17
<S> he shook his head , perceived the cabaret at which he had left aramis , and putting his horse to the trot , he shortly pulled up at the door .: 34.44
<S> the monk .: 37.27
<S> there always comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before god ; and see , perhaps it is a happiness for you , humble and powerless as i am , that you have met with me , for if i leave this place , well i have powerful friends , who , after having exerted themselves on my account , may also exert themselves for you . oh , when i said i was alone , said milady , hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself , it is not for want of friends in high places ; but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal .: 64.49
<S> he sees me in despair , and pretends he can not understand me ! you mistake i understand you perfectly .: 47.03
<S> his family will care much about such a trifle as that !: 70.26
<S> london is far from paris , very far , and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers ? what matters it , if you avoid them ? hold , madame bonacieux , said the mercer , hold !: 60.90
<S> but make haste i can not stay here all day . other footsteps , going and coming , were now heard , and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dante s ears , the bed creaked , and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor ; then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it .: 76.81
<S> his visits were tolerably regular , though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time , but generally , both in summer and winter , he took possession of his apartment about four o clock , though he never spent the night there .: 85.44
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> let d artagnan speak , said athos ; you know he always has wise advice to give . clearly , said d artagnan , we must go where they will not look for us .: 35.78
<S> the inspector visited , one after another , the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners , whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government .: 70.17
<S> and who brought you up ? he asked again .: 23.88
<S> d artagnan and porthos went on , meantime , to paris .: 21.63
<S> mazarin resumed his reading : it is important , therefore , monseigneur , that i should be informed as to the intentions of france .: 33.74
<S> but the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate .: 53.92
<S> but do you mean to say you have not heard of this ?: 16.86
<S> ah , i would give much to have five hundred louis , only . so would i , said porthos , unwilling to be behind d artagnan in generosity ; i would give as much as a hundred pistoles . the two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when comminges entered , preceded by a sergeant and two men , who brought supper in a basket with two handles , filled with basins and plates .: 47.49
<S> ah , i see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart . hum ! said the major .: 24.41
<S> milady , as athos had foreseen , on finding the two men that awaited her , made no difficulty in following them .: 35.29
<S> thus , for instance , the excellent abbe adelmonte , of whom i spoke just now , made in this way some marvellous experiments . really ? yes ; i will mention one to you .: 34.28
<S> faith , i ve half a mind to do it .: 66.25
<S> by the word of a gentleman , you shall have no cause to repent of your confidence . well , monsieur , you understand that uneasiness makes us do many things . what have you done ? oh , nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor . well ? monsieur porthos gave us a note for his duchess , ordering us to put it in the post .: 39.38
<S> she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear , pale and trembling , to forbid the signing of the contract , like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor .: 56.28
<S> she had been standing at the door , to prevent his going out without seeing her , until sleep , which the young can not resist , had overpowered her frame , wearied as she was with watching .: 56.11
<S> i have torn up two of my shirts , and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of , to complete the precious pages .: 69.08
<S> what think you , danglars , said one of the party , turning towards him , of this event ? why , replied he , i think it just possible dante s may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband . but how could he have done so without your knowledge , danglars , since you are the ship s supercargo ? why , as for that , i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden .: 56.58
<S> you know i take but little sleep , and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either . bertuccio bowed , and resumed his story .: 33.45
<S> well , said the other , if this last resource fail you ? well , returned morrel , it is a cruel thing to be forced to say , but , already used to misfortune , i must habituate myself to shame .: 32.01
<S> have me arrested on the part of the queen , said he , and i i will appeal to his eminence . at once mme .: 31.79
<S> here we are at the camp ; therefore , gentlemen , not a word more of this affair .: 31.55
<S> call charles , he added , addressing the boy who waited .: 46.37
<S> let me meditate and consider . meditate and consider as much as you like , replied porthos , who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn .: 60.16
<S> come with me , my friend , said the englishman ; i wish to speak to you . chapter 30 .: 9.74
<S> save my husband !: 69.19
<S> athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons ; aramis with sword and pistol in his hands , athos with his sword in his scabbard , his pistol in his saddle bags ; calm and cool as if on the parade , except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes .: 60.36
<S> come , now , said the duke , give some particulars of the plan for our escape . that is forbidden me , said grimaud , until the last moment . who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch ? i know nothing about it , my lord . but at least , if you don t want to see me turn crazy , tell what that famous pate will contain . two poniards , a knotted rope and a poire d angoisse . this poire d angoisse was a famous gag , in the form of a pear , which , being thrust into the mouth , by the aid of a spring , dilated , so as to distend the jaws to their greatest width .: 51.07
<S> i also looked at him ; then he understood , and putting his hand into a drawer , he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in lyons . for a thousand pistoles ? for a thousand pistoles just that amount , the beggar ; not one too many . and you have them ? they are here . upon my word , i think he acted very generously . generously !: 51.37
<S> one must take the world as one finds it .: 61.54
<S> everything , said olivain to athos , has been done according to your directions ; the horses are waiting . and i was asleep , cried raoul , whilst you , sir , you had the kindness to attend to all these details .: 40.00
<S> today is the 5th of june . yes . well , renew these bills up to the 5th of september ; and on the 5th of september at eleven o clock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven , i shall come to receive the money . i shall expect you , returned morrel ; and i will pay you or i shall be dead . these last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear them .: 32.96
<S> of what country ? a frenchman . your name ? edmond dante s. your profession ? a sailor . how long have you been here ? since the 28th of february , 1815. your crime ? i am innocent . but of what are you accused ? of having conspired to aid the emperor s return . what !: 51.26
<S> planchet , d artagnan s valet , supported his good fortune nobly .: 48.91
<S> you can not , at least , deny that you are very harsh judges of each other . if we are so , it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement .: 49.10
<S> woe is me !: 63.69
<S> he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart , and by their union constitute a passion so strange , and as it were , diabolical .: 74.04
<S> monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased .: 89.88
<S> d artagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son .: 25.33
<S> aramis calmly drew his sword , which he had carried between his teeth as he swam .: 30.26
<S> his eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly , and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed .: 141.62
<S> what would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman ?: 74.86
<S> madame de villefort merely cried , be still , edward ! she then added , this young madcap is , however , very nearly right , and merely re echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times ; for mademoiselle de villefort is , in spite of all we can do to rouse her , of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit , which frequently injure the effect of her beauty .: 72.16
<S> another salver passed , loaded like the preceding ones ; she saw albert attempt to persuade the count , but he obstinately refused .: 102.00
<S> what fault do you find with the fellow ? he is a glutton . oh , sir ! cried olivain , reappearing at this accusation .: 48.48
<S> each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion ; his first and most indelible recollections were there ; not a tree , not a street , that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories .: 121.68
<S> it was thus worded : my dear fellow , the moment you have received this , have the kindness to take the letter of credit from my pocket book , which you will find in the square drawer of the secre taire ; add your own to it , if it be not sufficient .: 32.07
<S> some years only .: 122.54
<S> for heaven s sake , do not serve as a conductor between that man and me .: 41.66
<S> the next day , in fact , at daybreak , the court made preparations to quit saint germain .: 25.95
<S> your excellencies permit it ? asked the host .: 21.12
<S> do you not see that i reserve eighty francs for myself ?: 33.27
<S> as to that , you must leave it to me . i give you absolute power , therefore ; take as large an escort as you like . d artagnan shook his head .: 29.37
<S> the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the foundation or pglaf , owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg electronic works .: 10.35
<S> they had repaired it completely , and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dante s had partly filled in .: 118.17
<S> the groom heard him with humility , took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand , and with the right held out the reins to andrea , who , taking them from him , rested his polished boot lightly on the step .: 49.90
<S> but and i say it with some pride , merce de s god needed me , and i lived .: 51.61
<S> see him there , cold as marble and proud like his father .: 109.86
<S> beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room .: 94.72
<S> i heard the noise he made in loading his pistols , and his servant in loading his musketoon .: 40.39
<S> a cold perspiration burst from every pore , and his hair stood on end .: 40.10
<S> it seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him , and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss .: 33.33
<S> benedetto rejoined his associates , and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool . sweet child , murmured monte cristo .: 52.33
<S> meant .: 201.99
<S> i know it well ; i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces .: 46.77
<S> you are gentlemen , and i am a poor innkeeper .: 22.02
<S> well ! cried he , throwing his sword upon the bed , this man must be the devil in person ; he has disappeared like a phantom , like a shade , like a specter . do you believe in apparitions ? asked athos of porthos .: 33.51
<S> i do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rights that would be to accuse her majesty , queen anne , of falsehood . with the queen , sir ? replied athos , in his calm , vibrating voice .: 50.65
<S> cromwell s house .: 83.98
<S> to arms ! and immediately put spur to horse , which set off along the rue saint honore with the speed of the whirlwind .: 55.06
<S> oh , yes , yes ; be assured i shall save you !: 17.30
<S> he will set sail tomorrow morning . fort la pointe , or fort vasou , was not built until 1672 , nearly 50 years later .: 83.84
<S> your affectionate anne buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter ; then , when it was ended , as if he had met with a bitter disappointment , he asked , have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice , laporte ? the queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself , for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted . and is that all is that all ? replied buckingham , impatiently .: 65.30
<S> and he is in paris ? continued he , addressing raoul ; then turning to the queen : we may still hope .: 32.43
<S> let me know my crime , and the reason why i was condemned .: 33.10
<S> in this state of mutual understanding , they reached leghorn .: 58.88
<S> beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage .: 87.35
<S> i am on the point of starting on a journey , replied morrel disdainfully .: 23.83
<S> coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of cheese , some preserved quinces , and a cake which she had herself made of almonds and honey .: 93.00
<S> sire , the usurper is arming three ships , he meditates some project , which , however mad , is yet , perhaps , terrible .: 105.83
<S> madame de lannoy , whom , according to your majesty s command , i have frequently interrogated , told me this morning that the night before last her majesty sat up very late , that this morning she wept much , and that she was writing all day . that s it ! cried the king ; to him , no doubt .: 47.38
<S> well , said the queen , when the chancellor had finished speaking ; what do you think of it all ? i think that matters look very gloomy , madame . but what step would you propose to me ? i could propose one to your majesty , but i dare not . you may , you may , sir , said the queen with a bitter smile ; you were not so timid once . the chancellor reddened and stammered some words .: 34.65
<S> the young greek , as we have already said , occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count .: 61.26
<S> it was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him .: 30.09
<S> it was the evening before when i had fallen asleep ; my sleep , then , must have lasted twenty four hours !: 54.09
<S> what ! cried aramis and athos , what !: 21.27
<S> we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe .: 57.76
<S> what can have happened , then , to bragelonne ? let him enter , cried d artagnan ; let him come up . but grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step ; so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it .: 32.00
<S> he will arrange everything for me .: 54.19
<S> he has but one fault , he is somewhat wilful ; but really , on referring for the moment to what he said , do you truly believe that mithridates used these precautions , and that these precautions were efficacious ? i think so , madame , because i myself have made use of them , that i might not be poisoned at naples , at palermo , and at smyrna that is to say , on three several occasions when , but for these precautions , i must have lost my life . and your precautions were successful ? completely so . yes , i remember now your mentioning to me at perugia something of this sort . indeed ? said the count with an air of surprise , remarkably well counterfeited ; i really did not remember . i inquired of you if poisons acted equally , and with the same effect , on men of the north as on men of the south ; and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south . and that is the case , observed monte cristo .: 57.46
<S> i had , at the moment of being ordained , a little difficulty with but that would not interest you , and i am taking up your valuable time . not at all ; it interests me very much , cried d artagnan ; and at this moment i have absolutely nothing to do . yes , but i have my breviary to repeat , answered aramis ; then some verses to compose , which madame d aiguillon begged of me .: 47.62
<S> the duke has had many affairs of gallantry ; and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy , he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities . no doubt , said milady , coolly , such a woman may be found . well , such a woman , who would place the knife of jacques cle ment or of ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic , would save france . yes ; but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination . were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques cle ment ever known ? no ; for perhaps they were too high placed for anyone to dare look for them where they were .: 75.65
<S> they were surrounded by a crowd of people , who opened a way for us to pass , when suddenly my mother , having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention , uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground , pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates , and beneath which were inscribed these words : this is the head of ali tepelini , pasha of yanina . i cried bitterly , and tried to raise my mother from the earth , but she was dead !: 57.62
<S> andrea made no resistance , although he protested against it .: 47.08
<S> every soldier must be ambitious , must he not ?: 79.21
<S> then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase , with a strength apparently above that of a woman ; but finding she could not accomplish this , she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard , the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood .: 71.39
<S> alack ! cried the cardinal , a venetian glass ! oh , my lord , said d artagnan , quietly shutting the window , it is not worth while weeping yet , for probably an hour hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the palais royal , whether they be venetian or parisian . but what do you advise , then ? asked mazarin , trembling .: 42.96
<S> this glove , wherever it had not touched the muddy ground , was of irreproachable odor .: 117.28
<S> never ! sire , i entreat you to do so . besides , in what manner can i make advances first ? by doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her . what is that ? give a ball ; you know how much the queen loves dancing .: 50.40
<S> three or four times he started up , imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of stabbing him .: 40.47
<S> now promise me to remember this , and expect me the 21st of may at the same hour in the forenoon . capital ! exclaimed albert ; your breakfast shall be waiting . where do you live ? no .: 45.65
<S> felton mounted the ladder first , and gave his hand to milady , while the sailors supported her , for the sea was still much agitated .: 41.80
<S> i know who it is ! then putting his face to the lowered blinds , he said : i wish you joy , my lord ! impudent fellow ! cried d artagnan , you will get me turned off . the gate groaned on its hinges , and d artagnan , seeing the way clear , whipped his horses , who started at a canter , and five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal .: 40.79
<S> a hundred pistoles ! said d artagnan to himself ; he calls that being as poor as job !: 33.98
<S> a prisoner has escaped from the cha teau d if , and they are firing the alarm gun , replied dante s .: 26.96
<S> you agree that the foundation , the trademark owner , and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual , direct , indirect , consequential , punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage .: 14.90
<S> oh , heavens ! continued olivain , in despair , what would the count say if he only saw you now ! the count would do as i do , replied raoul , urging his horse vigorously forward .: 36.23
<S> how long a start have they ? two hours and a quarter , my officer . two hours and a quarter that is nothing ; we are well mounted , are we not , porthos ? porthos breathed a sigh ; he thought of what was in store for his poor horses .: 47.97
<S> a summer ball the same day during the interview between madame danglars and the procureur , a travelling carriage entered the rue du helder , passed through the gateway of no .: 54.89
<S> aramis therefore had written immediately to marie michon , the seamstress at tours who had such fine acquaintances , to obtain from the queen authority for mme .: 140.52
<S> ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered .: 41.20
<S> his eminence took the paper , and read in a slow voice , dwelling upon every syllable : dec .: 45.47
<S> that will be the signal when i call out jesus seigneur ! but give us your word that you will come too , d artagnan , said athos .: 44.90
<S> what more need be said ?: 102.35
<S> ladies , said the officer , do not disturb yourselves ; allow me time just to kill this gentleman , and i will return and finish the last couplet . we went out .: 38.90
<S> but what do i see in the water something struggling ? oh , yes , exclaimed raoul , fixing his glance on one point in the stream , splendidly illumined by the setting sun , a horse , a rider ! they are sinking ! cried olivain in his turn .: 44.79
<S> monte cristo , left alone , took three or four steps onwards , and murmured : here , beneath this plane tree , must have been where the infant s grave was dug .: 63.20
<S> the agamemnon of aeschylus is based on this legend .: 82.61
<S> the yacht moved rapidly on , though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young girl .: 54.26
<S> he still lives . are you quite sure of it ? i am he . there was a moment of cold silence , during which everyone was affected according to his nature .: 38.22
<S> albert sprang out , bearing his moccoletto in his hand .: 18.62
<S> eh , no !: 25.16
<S> did you not tell me it was a family jewel ? yes , my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it , as he once told me .: 29.71
<S> apropos , should mazarin speak to you about me , tell him that i should have requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether i am , as he says , too old for action . and rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make d artagnan shudder , but d artagnan could now see it without alarm , and smiling in his turn , with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could , perhaps , alone give to his countenance , he said : go , demon , do what thou wilt !: 54.76
<S> i drew my knife from my pocket again , opened it , and made ready to strike .: 39.44
<S> the lion bit the hand thus favored , and at the end of twenty four hours , the bite was mortal .: 56.66
<S> guitant and comminges , at the head of the guards , marched first ; then came the royal carriage , with d artagnan on one side , porthos on the other ; then the musketeers , for two and twenty years staunch friends of d artagnan .: 44.58
<S> athos fixed upon a certain cahusac , a favorite of the cardinal s .: 53.62
<S> toward the middle of the town , commanding the principal open space , rose a dark mass , separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous lime trees .: 55.32
<S> it is dangerous to go to war with a nation .: 59.38
<S> around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles .: 63.51
<S> i am free , then , sir ? cried dante s joyfully .: 13.16
<S> courage ! the bell of the convent gate was sounded ; milady was not mistaken .: 42.89
<S> he offered his arm to the countess ; she took it , or rather just touched it with her little hand , and they together descended the steps , lined with rhododendrons and camellias .: 51.67
<S> the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes ; he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf .: 85.53
<S> what took place at portsmouth august 23 , 1628 chapter lx .: 46.24
<S> as for planchet , he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush ; the poor lad s strength was almost exhausted .: 29.93
<S> i am fifteen years younger than he is .: 33.03
<S> in the meantime the cortege returned to the palais royal .: 13.74
<S> you ask what i have against you ; i tell you .: 33.54
<S> athos remained sitting .: 35.83
<S> farewell , said charles , farewell , my children .: 53.56
<S> felton , i dare not tell you at what idea i smiled ; you would hold me in horror go on !: 74.05
<S> you can t think how i have missed him , the great simpleton .: 55.78
<S> a dreadful silence followed the reading of this document ; the count could only stare , and his gaze , fixed as if unconsciously on hayde e , seemed one of fire and blood .: 68.79
<S> it was one of those events which decide the life of a man ; it was a choice between the king and the cardinal the choice made , it must be persisted in .: 35.00
<S> oh , leave me , sir ; you are tempting me you make me doubt the goodness of providence it is impossible , it can not be ! are you the first that this hand has stricken ?: 51.95
<S> well , but we should be taken out of prison ; madame bonacieux was released .: 46.20
<S> athos now descended the ladder in his turn , without losing sight of the young man .: 25.09
<S> it struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the rue aux ours . attorney but how do you know all this ? because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter , saying that monsieur porthos was a weathercock , and that she was sure it was for some woman he had received this wound . has he been wounded , then ? oh , good lord !: 52.73
<S> yes , he s not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow ; he ll defend himself . well , we must try to take him alive .: 29.62
<S> the major will bring his son with him this evening , the contino , as we say in italy ; he confides him to my care .: 47.87
<S> at length she murmured , satisfied with herself , come , nothing is lost ; i am still beautiful . it was then nearly eight o clock in the evening .: 34.21
<S> what a flavor ! cried d artagnan ; ah !: 21.35
<S> i think it is kept a secret from grandpapa noirtier , that the contract is to be signed this evening . morrel went also to the notary , who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening .: 41.75
<S> this execution quieted the ill disposed , who resolved to allow themselves to die of hunger this death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strangulation .: 161.13
<S> well !: 14.47
<S> and the headsman of bethune gave me a reply . de winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply .: 49.50
<S> it is for me to reply to that ! and the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn .: 26.94
<S> 25th april , 1498 .: 30.40
<S> our position is truly a strange one , continued athos , laughing .: 35.87
<S> a lieutenant in the corsican battalion . a soldier of the usurper , then ? a soldier of the french army . well , replied he , he has smitten with the sword , and he has perished by the sword . you are mistaken , monsieur , i replied ; he has perished by the poniard . what do you want me to do ? asked the magistrate .: 25.38
<S> you see , then , morrel , that he was a more unhappy lover than you . and has he found consolation ? he has at least found peace . and does he ever expect to be happy ? he hopes so , maximilian . the young man s head fell on his breast .: 38.16
<S> there was a dispute among the guards .: 31.29
<S> bassompierre and schomberg , against the duc d angoule me .: 24.57
<S> what do you want with a notary ? again repeated villefort .: 29.75
<S> port wine .: 58.84
<S> all my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom i thought my friend , and who betrayed me .: 79.16
<S> i think i have sprained my wrist , said porthos .: 28.23
<S> the young men , therefore , had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of lucia di lammermoor , supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy .: 52.08
<S> beauchamp chapter 85 .: 42.51
<S> the comb was to be a leaden one , because his beard , like that of most fair people , was rather red ; he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it .: 108.46
<S> sacre bleu ! said athos .: 61.50
<S> bonacieux , what is it ? it is the uniform of the cardinal s guards .: 15.02
<S> d artagnan and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized them .: 37.48
<S> coquenard recognized her present , and could not at first comprehend this restitution ; but the visit of porthos soon enlightened her .: 82.69
<S> and you can not deny it ! added villefort , extending his hand toward her , as though to seize her in the name of justice .: 20.07
<S> oh , said madame de villefort , smiling , are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed ? madame danglars rose suddenly .: 40.74
<S> a bad relapse , that will lead you , if i mistake not , to the place de gre ve .: 56.32
<S> we want , said athos , charlotte backson , who first was called comtesse de la fe re , and afterwards milady de winter , baroness of sheffield . that is i !: 47.34
<S> gentlemen , replied d artagnan , i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence .: 24.83
<S> monte cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead , but drew back when the waiter was presented to him ; he took no refreshment .: 23.12
<S> gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats , which he had utterly forgotten .: 39.41
<S> beat the messenger ! cried porthos .: 36.23
<S> if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal , which is not to be doubted , and if he has recognized me , as is probable , i may consider myself almost as a condemned man , said d artagnan , shaking his head .: 32.97
<S> pardieu ! said d artagnan , you know you will not be my prisoner very long . no , said aramis , they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the philipghauts . and how were they treated ? asked d artagnan .: 23.07
<S> conceal your wounds when you have any ; silence is the last joy of the unhappy .: 116.50
<S> i place no confidence in their hypocritical faces .: 81.45
<S> none at all .: 47.53
<S> seven men in two days , and those of his very best !: 59.43
<S> while the waiter was preparing his room , the hostess arose ; andrea assumed his most charming smile , and asked if he could have no .: 50.33
<S> as to the commencement of an intrigue between her and m. de wardes , our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that , although the marquis was young , handsome , rich , and high in the cardinal s favor .: 43.44
<S> he ! he cried ; he venture himself amongst us , to be hung !: 43.14
<S> how do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions ? asked the beadle .: 27.48
<S> at length milady could hold out no longer ; she broke the silence .: 53.21
<S> the soil was humid and glittering with the rain which had recently fallen , and the refreshed herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy .: 90.83
<S> my husband has five or six valises ; you shall choose the best .: 66.68
<S> while exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls , they excited them secretly to quarrel , deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants .: 204.23
<S> at the noise they made , she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him , he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach , kitty opened the door .: 74.97
<S> julie hesitated .: 55.16
<S> grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the comte de la fere .: 38.44
<S> in losing sight of his guardian , whom he had quitted , gazing after him in front of the royal basilican , raoul spurred on his horse , in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections , but also to hide from olivain the emotion his face might betray .: 66.49
<S> but let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the pharaon .: 65.86
<S> the two friends were perfectly stupefied .: 14.03
<S> where are you running to ? exclaimed a voice .: 21.63
<S> were the late cardinal richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the bastion saint gervais , which we four , with our four lackeys and twelve dead men , held out against a whole army . such feats , sir , are done once and never repeated . however , nowadays there s no need of so much heroism .: 111.66
<S> they merit richly that piece of attention on your part . the advice is good , monsieur , and tomorrow i will set out . tomorrow !: 66.16
<S> for a mind so perspicuous as that of d artagnan , this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future .: 67.99
<S> my dear m. d artagnan , said the minister , sitting down , i am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an officer . i hope , said d artagnan , bowing , that you give it , my lord , without hesitation and with the conviction that i am worthy of it . more worthy than any one in paris my dear friend ; therefore i apply to you .: 28.36
<S> when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brig s departure , its route , its landings ; and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation .: 112.83
<S> then he had made himself another enemy , less to be feared , he thought ; but nevertheless , he instinctively felt , not to be despised .: 41.47
<S> in about ten minutes d artagnan appeared at the door , followed by the inseparable porthos .: 17.85
<S> at the end of two hundred years the documents were found , and they thought of bringing up the jars .: 24.30
<S> gentlemen , said groslow , i beg you will take your places .: 18.42
<S> among them was one of a very singular form , which appeared to have come from a distance .: 32.79
<S> and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell . oh !: 64.00
<S> d artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them ; but although the king knew athos , porthos , and aramis personally , he passed before them without speaking or looking indeed , as if he had never seen them before .: 44.39
<S> monseigneur , said he , my life is yours ; henceforth dispose of it .: 34.46
<S> that neutrality consists simply in excluding king charles from the territory of france and in refraining from helping him a stranger to your country with arms , with money or with troops .: 189.33
<S> suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air , and dante s knew that the mistral was blowing .: 54.28
<S> the breakfast and what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast ? said beauchamp .: 41.86
<S> valentine , when her name was made the subject of discussion , had stepped back , to escape unpleasant observation ; her eyes were cast down , and she was crying .: 56.20
<S> then , after seeing her eyes closed , and hearing her breathe gently , he believed she had dropped asleep , and left the apartment on tiptoe , closing the door after him with the utmost precaution .: 31.89
<S> here you can get anything you want ; by paying for it , of course , as among honest folk . of course ! cried danglars .: 69.21
<S> the iron made no impression , but met with a smooth surface ; dante s touched it , and found that it was a beam .: 46.63
<S> but i swear to you , before god who hears us , that if you betray me , and my enemies pardon me , i will kill myself , while accusing you of my death . and i i swear to you before god , madame , said d artagnan , that if i am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me , i will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone . then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the samaritaine .: 45.35
<S> do not forget your crosses .: 46.30
<S> i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take , and scarcely was i there when , amidst the gusts of wind , i fancied i heard groans ; but you know , or rather you do not know , your excellency , that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears .: 88.62
<S> she was at length appeased , and the conversation turned upon him while kitty was assisting her mistress .: 57.76
<S> so that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old england you see how we snapped up the proposition . yes , i know that you charged by the side of mordaunt . on his right and left , sir .: 65.47
<S> are you still friends with monsieur porthos and monsieur aramis ? add monsieur d artagnan , my lord .: 28.22
<S> she was a nun in the convent of the benedictines of templemar .: 32.25
<S> the king , quite delighted , inquired if the cardinal was still at the louvre ; he was told that his eminence awaited the orders of his majesty in the business cabinet .: 35.25
<S> i could defy a nation ! be quiet , porthos , said d artagnan , we are observed . we are admired , i faith , answered porthos .: 31.14
<S> his long , dark hair , softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils , fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls ; his voice was still youthful , as if belonging to a hercules of twenty five , and his magnificent teeth , which he had preserved white and sound , gave an indescribable charm to his smile .: 105.85
<S> the spadas remained in doubtful ease , a mystery hung over this dark affair , and the public rumor was , that c sar , a better politician than his father , had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals .: 65.23
<S> no ; i make you my lieutenant general , said the king .: 32.86
<S> what has happened , then ? sir , interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos , if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen .: 37.49
<S> killed him , or poniarded him , sir , as is most agreeable to you . i did not know that , replied m. de tre ville , in a somewhat softened tone .: 24.13
<S> villefort retired to his study , and d avrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty , whose office it is to examine bodies after decease , and who is expressly named the doctor of the dead . m. noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grandchild .: 68.57
<S> well , marquis , said monte cristo , you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you . ah , your excellency , i am overwhelmed with delight . and what are your feelings ? said monte cristo , turning to the young man .: 22.52
<S> what can have become of her , then ? we shall know , be assured .: 23.67
<S> every man that s born must fulfil his destiny . if it be not an indelicate question , resumed d artagnan , have you grown rich ? oh , heaven !: 45.00
<S> still further , his confidence in the worthy picard , at one time so great , diminished day by day .: 121.44
<S> the steamer soon disappeared , and in an hour afterwards , as the count had said , was scarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the night .: 34.11
<S> he took up the deadly weapon again , his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock , and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol .: 34.87
<S> this room was occupied by dante s father .: 26.66
<S> it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic , and the way in which he had achieved the discovery , which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness , increased edmond s admiration of him ; but at the same time dante s could not believe that the deposit , supposing it had ever existed , still existed ; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical , he yet believed it was no longer there .: 48.61
<S> well , let us sleep at noyon , said raoul .: 19.99
<S> by the way , planchet , i think you are right with respect to our host , and that he is decidedly a frightfully low wretch . ah , monsieur , you may take my word when i tell you anything .: 30.66
<S> here , i have brought mine with me , replied albert .: 26.79
<S> for all this , continued milady , i should long ago have revenged myself on him if , and i don t know why , the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate him . oh , yes ; but madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond of . what , the mercer s wife of the rue des fossoyeurs ?: 49.50
<S> you can not beat me , said he ; you have no right , for you are not my father . 20299m we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret , which we had so carefully concealed from him ; however , it was this answer , in which the child s whole character revealed itself , that almost terrified me , and my arm fell without touching him .: 50.30
<S> aramis tried to withdraw his hand , but the king still held it .: 31.36
<S> before his departure , the count went to hayde e s apartments , told her his intention , and resigned everything to her care .: 45.67
<S> flee alone ! flee alone , and leave you here ?: 65.12
<S> fear nothing , he said ; i have my conditions to impose .: 54.91
<S> when i saw you at your chateau at bragelonne , i made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood ; instead of answering me as a friend , you played with me as a child ; the friendship , therefore , that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords , but by your dissimulation at your castle . d artagnan ! said athos , reproachfully .: 51.67
<S> these three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting snugly into his pocket .: 81.86
<S> they passed close by the unhappy being , who , concealed behind the damask curtain , almost felt merce de s dress brush past him , and his son s warm breath , pronouncing these words : courage , mother !: 88.40
<S> you know very well that the last was stopped on his way , dashed on the rocks , and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows . they ascended five or six more steps , and then dante s felt that they took him , one by the head and the other by the heels , and swung him to and fro .: 48.63
<S> at that moment the countenance of mme .: 12.32
<S> no , but i know a little about wounds , and mine , i know , is mortal .: 33.62
<S> a fe te was so rare a thing for poor anne of austria that at this announcement , as the cardinal had predicted , the last trace of her resentment disappeared , if not from her heart , at least from her countenance .: 66.03
<S> in the passage she saw a retreating shadow ; it was julie , who , uneasy herself , had anticipated her mother .: 49.16
<S> if monsieur aramis hesitates to come , he said , tell him i am from tours . from tours ! cried aramis .: 37.91
<S> i should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded . yes , but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon ; the donjon being taken , i should be obliged to let them hang you at which i should be most unhappy , certainly . and in his turn the duke bowed low to monsieur de chavigny .: 69.37
<S> yes , my lord . ah , that is true , said de guiche ; i had forgotten it . that is easily understood ; it was you who took him , count , said raoul , smiling .: 16.30
<S> i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public , and a sweet kiss in private . full of this idea , villefort s face became so joyous , that when he turned to dante s , the latter , who had watched the change on his physiognomy , was smiling also .: 53.06
<S> yours will be returned to you tomorrow .: 73.71
<S> amid all this , d artagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos .: 72.36
<S> someone is coming !: 59.98
<S> he found his horse and that of porthos fastened to the manger , but to an empty manger .: 55.82
<S> you were saying this , were you not ? well , i own it . i will answer you . villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars ; then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual : there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown , and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty ; but when the culprits are discovered villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered , i swear to you , by all i hold most sacred , that whoever they may be they shall die .: 84.19
<S> three times i presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away . oh , mon dieu !: 44.71
<S> as happy as it is allowed to one of god s creatures to be on this earth ; but say out all you think , d artagnan , for you have not yet done so . you are too bad , athos ; one can hide nothing from you , answered d artagnan .: 38.32
<S> he had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur s footstep was heard in the passage .: 36.29
<S> but was it my father s ring ?: 36.43
<S> why do you stop here ? asked d e pinay .: 12.74
<S> why buy what one can take ? take ! said blaisois ; covet the goods of your neighbor ?: 105.76
<S> as i came into the public room , i saw one of our englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse , his own having died yesterday from bleeding .: 92.92
<S> this toast , recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving king of france , excited universal enthusiasm ; glasses were elevated in the air a l anglaise , and the ladies , snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms , strewed the table with their floral treasures .: 206.34
<S> i feel easy , replied porthos .: 28.07
<S> was it not agreed , asked the count , that not only my person , but also that of my friends , should be respected by you ? and how have i broken that treaty , your excellency ? you have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the viscount albert de morcerf .: 61.98
<S> noirtier looked at villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride .: 23.91
<S> these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been .: 120.80
<S> it is impossible .: 14.32
<S> arrived at leghorn , he repaired to the house of a jew , a dealer in precious stones , to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each .: 71.47
<S> one of the officers went to the place i directed .: 27.56
<S> but parry clasped his hands and implored him , and at last he agreed .: 43.72
<S> speak , d artagnan , speak . d artagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become lieutenant of the musketeers , but her majesty had never once spoken to him .: 25.04
<S> it came from my brother , the king of spain .: 27.61
<S> if you are not located in the united states , you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this ebook .: 10.33
<S> did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing ?: 190.11
<S> groslow began turning the cards one after another .: 279.76
<S> oh , faria , faria , how well did you judge men and things ! what did you please to say , sir ? asked caderousse .: 37.14
<S> what ! cried he , in an accent of greater astonishment than before , your second witness is monsieur aramis ? doubtless !: 51.04
<S> my dear m. lucien , said madame danglars through the door , you are always complaining that euge nie will not address a word to you . madame , said lucien , playing with a little dog , who , recognizing him as a friend of the house , expected to be caressed , i am not the only one who makes similar complaints , i think i heard morcerf say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed . true , said madame danglars ; yet i think this will all pass off , and that you will one day see her enter your study . my study ? at least that of the minister . why so ! to ask for an engagement at the opera .: 45.31
<S> at this moment grimaud appeared at the door .: 8.61
<S> after a long talk with the harbor master , captain leclere left naples greatly disturbed in mind .: 292.05
<S> villefort whispered some words in his ear , to which the officer replied by a motion of his head .: 33.79
<S> the first notary handed over each note , as he examined it , to his colleague .: 54.55
<S> the assizes chapter 110 .: 24.36
<S> mounting on the breach , with his musket in one hand and his hat in the other , he said , bowing courteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers , who , astonished at this apparition , stopped fifty paces from the bastion : gentlemen , a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion .: 52.56
<S> do not charge a fee for access to , viewing , displaying , performing , copying or distributing any project gutenberg works unless you comply with paragraph 1.e.8 or 1.e.9 .: 7.78
<S> i married that woman when she was a young girl ; i married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family ; i gave her my wealth , i gave her my name ; and one day i discovered that this woman was branded this woman was marked with a fleur de lis on her left shoulder . oh , said milady , raising herself , i defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against me .: 42.51
<S> there is the port , he murmured .: 22.11
<S> sitting alone , in the front of a box immediately opposite , but situated on the third row , was a woman of exquisite beauty , dressed in a greek costume , which evidently , from the ease and grace with which she wore it , was her national attire .: 57.41
<S> oh ! cried aramis , do you see , count ? yes , said athos .: 9.56
<S> they told me the executioner of bethune was here and wounded , when you uttered two piercing cries .: 73.59
<S> the telegraph m. and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo , who had come to visit them in their absence , had been ushered into the drawing room , and was still awaiting them there .: 27.08
<S> my son , said the old gascon gentleman , in that pure be arn patois of which henry iv .: 61.92
<S> without him i should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at saint cloud , for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river .: 67.95
<S> it is so hot at marseilles , that really i believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever .: 95.99
<S> do as you like , she said , i rely upon you . will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business ? command , sir . what do the people want this time ? demanded the king .: 35.60
<S> you never come to me without conferring pleasure .: 57.84
<S> and where am i ? inquired monte cristo laughingly .: 14.42
<S> the lackeys were sent on before with the baggage , and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth .: 33.82
<S> so you would rob the count of monte cristo ? continued the false abbe .: 34.05
<S> too big for a youth , too small for a grown man , an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmer s son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which , dangling from a leather baldric , hit against the calves of its owner as he walked , and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback .: 86.31
<S> father , said merce de s , stopping when she had reached the centre of the table , sit , i pray you , on my right hand ; on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me , pointing with a soft and gentle smile to fernand ; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him , for his lips became ghastly pale , and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart .: 63.03
<S> my servants are examining the bodies . let us go and see whether they are quite dead , or if they can still be helped , suggested raoul .: 45.64
<S> it is not here ! 50197m and then he moved farther on , and began again to dig .: 64.50
<S> the dying man s eyes were all the time riveted on the door , through which he hoped succor would arrive .: 56.71
<S> the salutation was so well understood that morrel , with the same expression in his eyes , placed his handkerchief to his mouth ; and these two living statues , whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect , separated from each other by the whole length of the room , forgot themselves for a moment , or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation .: 44.32
<S> while he turned this over in his mind planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table .: 127.29
<S> it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry , but because she will marry , a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow .: 50.77
<S> it was scarcely eleven o clock in the morning , and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m. de tre ville , who could not fail to think the manner in which d artagnan had left him a little cavalier .: 15.29
<S> yes . we should be so on this occasion , if only to be faithful to our oath , said aramis .: 39.72
<S> about seven o clock in the morning they set out .: 10.00
<S> mother nanette began by picking up the louis ; then she picked up friquet .: 203.99
<S> and what has happened to you , my dear porthos ? continued d artagnan .: 7.85
<S> there were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant ; women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms ; and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs , savoring of the man of quality a league off .: 148.85
<S> five letters to put before his three names , a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage !: 107.17
<S> morcerf s courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow .: 98.35
<S> report to the king the condition of affairs .: 99.04
<S> then you know him ? almost screamed the countess .: 54.77
<S> you have committed a piece of folly , said athos , but it can t be helped ; there is no drawing back .: 31.80
<S> d artagnan remained , therefore , alone ; and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting .: 82.39
<S> as for m. de villefort , he fulfilled the predictions of he loi se to the letter , donned his dress suit , drew on a pair of white gloves , ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery , and drove that same night to no .: 63.93
<S> political judgments are generally vain formalities , for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation .: 104.63
<S> but that is all .: 11.57
<S> scarcely , therefore , had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin , when , abandoning albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down , and as regularly followed by them , but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal , beginning , as a matter of course , with the lions den , the hall of the gladiators and finishing with c sar s podium , to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded , franz ascended a half dilapidated staircase , and , leaving them to follow their monotonous round , seated himself at the foot of a column , and immediately opposite a large aperture , which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin .: 103.34
<S> ah , i miss three , they were here last night , sir i am sure they were here i counted them .: 70.37
<S> i should be obliged , besides my steward , to keep a clerk and a boy .: 45.95
<S> let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes , but not speak of it . you are right ; but what are you going to do until this evening ?: 30.69
<S> well , then , let us say no more about it , said d artagnan ; and let us burn this letter , which , no doubt , announces to you some fresh infidelity of your grisette or your chambermaid . what letter ? cried aramis , eagerly .: 26.80
<S> my dear aramis , said d artagnan , if these are the prunes that are sent to you from tours , i beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them . you are mistaken , friend d artagnan , said aramis , always on his guard ; this is from my publisher , who has just sent me the price of that poem in one syllable verse which i began yonder . ah , indeed , said d artagnan .: 33.92
<S> a fleur de lis , said athos .: 15.54
<S> some wine ! said athos , on perceiving the host .: 21.59
<S> no ; how would you have me know ? parry bent his head and whispered to the king : it is the comte de la fere and his friends . raising my scaffold ! cried the king , astounded .: 25.66
<S> there was the crime , bertuccio that was where you became really culpable . true , excellency , that was the crime , the real crime , for in that i acted like a coward .: 75.01
<S> come in , my dear john , said lord de winter , come in , and shut the door . the young officer entered .: 17.42
<S> as morrel and his son embraced on the pier head , in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event , a man , with his face half covered by a black beard , and who , concealed behind the sentry box , watched the scene with delight , uttered these words in a low tone : be happy , noble heart , be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter , and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds . 20064m and with a smile expressive of supreme content , he left his hiding place , and without being observed , descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation , and hailing three times , shouted jacopo , jacopo , jacopo ! then a launch came to shore , took him on board , and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up , on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor ; thence he once again looked towards morrel , who , weeping with joy , was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him , and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies .: 94.87
<S> their connection could not last long without ruining both .: 199.78
<S> instead of going direct to his study , m. morrel had returned to his bedchamber , which he was only this moment quitting .: 35.21
<S> but the most fearful spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed , his face expressing all his meaning , and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty .: 79.39
<S> have you something to tell me ? asked he .: 14.62
<S> the envoy presented his letter of introduction , which the latter read with english coolness , and having finished : i understand , said he , perfectly . 30293m then began the questions , which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abbe busoni .: 61.95
<S> those who would , as it were , force a passage to his heart , found an impassable barrier .: 59.75
<S> unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg : 1.e.1 .: 28.93
<S> the guests having eaten the soup , were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips , when all at once the cannon sounded from fort louis and fort neuf .: 84.19
<S> the chevalier ! murmured charles .: 63.07
<S> well , he found us on his road and will not be baron this time .: 42.09
<S> ah , my dear father ! said andrea in a loud voice , in order that the count might hear him in the next room , is it really you ? how do you do , my dear son ? said the major gravely .: 16.51
<S> he turned towards his wife .: 10.71
<S> it is he ! cried bonacieux .: 10.81
<S> as regards yourself , the need of protection ; for it is fit you should know , monsieur d artagnan , that i have received heavy and serious complaints against you .: 51.15
<S> the cousin was received with resignation , that was all .: 49.00
<S> then what ? asked monte cristo .: 14.26
<S> m. andrea cavalcanti a murderer a galley slave escaped a convict ! an ironical smile curled the lip of euge nie .: 90.06
<S> you have a sad air . alas , said d artagnan , it is because i am the most unfortunate . tell me . presently , said d artagnan .: 17.01
<S> he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden , sent away barrois , and after having seated himself at his father s right hand , while madame de villefort placed herself on the left , he addressed him thus : i trust you will not be displeased , sir , that valentine has not come with us , or that i dismissed barrois , for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either .: 47.30
<S> what do you require , then ? i require an order which would ratify beforehand all that i should think proper to do for the greatest good of france . but in the first place , this woman i have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke . she is found , said milady .: 44.12
<S> there came in , moreover , two drafts which m. morrel had fully anticipated , and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted .: 94.02
<S> ho ! said porthos , raising himself in his bed ; what does she say ? d artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly , whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes , not daring to ask a single question .: 34.43
<S> oh , thank you a thousand times !: 25.88
<S> come in , come in , monsieur porthos ! the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks , who began to laugh ; but porthos turned sharply round , and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity .: 50.35
<S> he will do anything i wish .: 39.40
<S> this door was a mockery to the concierge , from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free , and , like that famous portal in the arabian nights , opening at the sesame of ali baba , it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world .: 125.91
<S> as porthos and aramis were undressing him , in the hope of finding his wound not mortal , a large purse dropped from his clothes .: 50.09
<S> idole de mon a me ! i was the first to discover duprez at naples , and the first to applaud him .: 103.82
<S> horse ! said aramis , with a grimace of disgust .: 23.68
<S> he was a nobleman , a man equal to buckingham in every respect .: 56.11
<S> vampa approached the corpse , and recognized cucumetto .: 46.35
<S> this was before his servant came .: 78.47
<S> why , on board the tartan , replied the sailor .: 27.64
<S> passing alongside one of them , d artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of meung the same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady , and whom d artagnan had thought so handsome ; but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind , his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her .: 53.18
<S> m. de villefort was , as usual , unmoved .: 20.10
<S> franz added that his companion , deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris , was most anxious to make up for it , and had requested him franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box , and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so .: 83.50
<S> is all safe , m. morrel ; and i think you will be satisfied on that head .: 28.95
<S> shall i tell you each ornament of your toilet ?: 39.59
<S> old dante s , however , sprang forward .: 28.63
<S> tell me , the first time you tasted oysters , tea , porter , truffles , and sundry other dainties which you now adore , did you like them ?: 85.61
<S> i am brave when i set about it .: 58.53
<S> how will this end ? he said .: 19.32
<S> the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps .: 81.25
<S> besides , d artagnan was but twenty years old , and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy habits .: 24.00
<S> a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling , casting a strong light into my chamber ; and i perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me .: 58.50
<S> what were you doing on that armchair ? asked he .: 13.65
<S> devil take it , he muttered to himself , don t let me betray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain them . well , then , said athos , what are your schemes ?: 26.63
<S> nor you to mine , cried the abbe .: 42.43
<S> oh , if you know him , tell me ! by a man of from forty to forty five years , with black hair , a dark complexion , and a scar on his left temple . that is he , that is he ; but his name ? ah , his name ?: 22.72
<S> you will be well fed there , if the hostess remains the same .: 41.30
<S> how can it be effected ? someone must be sent to the duke . but who , who ?: 33.39
<S> she is young ; she is beautiful ; she possesses all earthly seductions .: 45.92
<S> well ! cried the three musketeers all together , on seeing d artagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger .: 40.18
<S> you are placed on high , my lord , but tremble !: 41.08
<S> my death will be much more eloquent than my life , and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner . be silent , madame , cried felton , and do not speak to me thus ; i came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor , to swear to me by what you hold most sacred , that you will make no attempt upon your life . i will not promise , said milady , for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than i have ; and if i make a promise i must keep it . well , said felton , only promise till you have seen me again .: 36.62
<S> villefort took a chair , but valentine remained standing by her father s side , and franz before him , holding the mysterious paper in his hand .: 32.51
<S> nevertheless , raoul , you must go to blois and you must make your excuses and mine to madame de saint remy . the youth looked pleased .: 41.64
<S> my own conscience and your politeness , sir , are the guarantees of that . however flattering this compliment , the officer made no reply ; but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle , such as boatswains use in ships of war , he whistled three times , with three different modulations .: 85.62
<S> i think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early to morrow .: 51.05
<S> then that explains everything that is extraordinary , said andrea .: 33.45
<S> i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me .: 40.31
<S> his whiskers cut off , noirtier gave another turn to his hair ; took , instead of his black cravat , a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of an open portmanteau ; put on , in lieu of his blue and high buttoned frock coat , a coat of villefort s of dark brown , and cut away in front ; tried on before the glass a narrow brimmed hat of his son s , which appeared to fit him perfectly , and , leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it , he took up a small bamboo switch , cut the air with it once or twice , and walked about with that easy swagger which was one of his principal characteristics .: 89.40
<S> one doesn t hit the bull s eye every time ; it is something to hit inside the ring .: 79.17
<S> this woman passed for his sister .: 36.52
<S> penelon , said the captain , i think we are sinking , give me the helm , and go down into the hold . i gave him the helm , and descended ; there was already three feet of water .: 29.92
<S> no , i am lost ; do not be lost with me .: 19.35
<S> everyone hastened to purchase moccoletti franz and albert among the rest .: 123.19
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> come , he said , tis a warning from heaven .: 19.31
<S> i am no swordsman . well , don t be alarmed if i return at one , two or three o clock in the morning ; indeed , do not be alarmed if i do not come at all . this time bonacieux became so pale that d artagnan could not help perceiving it , and asked him what was the matter .: 23.13
<S> devil of a man , corsican that you are always mysteries or superstitions .: 159.60
<S> you have an opportunity now , count ; do not allow it to escape . d artagnan became very pale ; he was wounded in his self love : he thought that it was in his love .: 31.93
<S> i will allow you to make me hateful , but i will prevent your rendering me ridiculous , and , above all , i forbid you to ruin me . the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced ; but then she became pale , and , rising , as if touched by a spring , she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition ; she then took two or three steps towards her husband , as though to tear the secret from him , of which he was ignorant , or which he withheld from some odious calculation , odious , as all his calculations were .: 42.98
<S> i thought i had crushed you , madame ; but either i was deceived or hell has resuscitated you ! milady at these words , which recalled frightful remembrances , hung down her head with a suppressed groan .: 58.25
<S> you have read the letter ? yes . you know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in italy ? this is the name of the lower class .: 35.75
<S> he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and cast off cloaks for mousqueton , and thanks to a very intelligent tailor , who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them , and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic habits , mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master .: 98.22
<S> grimaud followed athos .: 38.78
<S> i found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all comprehend .: 37.40
<S> he would not .: 28.25
<S> it appears that the method i have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best .: 59.31
<S> vasiliki , said he to my mother , trembling perceptibly , the instant approaches which will decide everything .: 93.93
<S> all looked around ; athos himself stared .: 129.55
<S> the fourth auditor , who during all this conversation had played a mute part , made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition .: 60.95
<S> in fact , the dream of poor bazin had always been to serve a churchman ; and he awaited with impatience the moment , always in the future , when aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock .: 77.06
<S> the galley slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven , and saw each other .: 60.99
<S> we will wait for these gentlemen , so please you ; i have plenty of time , and it will be more correct .: 24.94
<S> ere long a carriage will dash past here , drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday ; now , at the risk of your own life , you must manage to stop those horses before my door . ali descended to the street , and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house , and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count , who was watching him .: 57.09
<S> on a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town , of which he was the life and soul .: 59.24
<S> m. danglars , however , while possessing a great admiration for the antique , as it was understood during the time of the directory , entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife s favorite sitting room , where , by the way , he was never permitted to intrude , unless , indeed , he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself ; and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced , than that of being the presenter of another , his reception being cordial or frigid , in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness .: 71.93
<S> indeed , you could not belong to him .: 21.77
<S> d artagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos , still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed .: 34.65
<S> monsieur porthos , said she , i can assure you that you have severely punished me ; and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a similar situation , you have but to apply to me . fie , madame , fie ! said porthos , as if disgusted .: 33.23
<S> call for me at eight o clock or shall i wait supper for you at seven ? that will do very well , said aramis .: 38.37
<S> no ; and you , porthos ? no ; and you , athos ? no ! if it was not you , it was your purveyor , said d artagnan .: 19.75
<S> i shall find many men as able as you are . i wish you may , my lord , replied de rochefort .: 23.18
<S> and must i lose the one to save the other ?: 48.37
<S> oh , exclaimed morrel , with a glance full of bitter reproach , do you think it possible that i could be ? listen , said the count .: 20.22
<S> perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts ; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight .: 117.70
<S> but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword , i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it . bazin , scandalized , made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand .: 62.78
<S> one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio .: 108.18
<S> you have told me the truth , my gentlemen , said he , addressing the musketeers , and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you .: 26.19
<S> nothing was heard but cries of live the musketeers !: 116.69
<S> our gascon promised this without risk , for he knew all that was meant .: 50.03
<S> i had no longer any wish to live for myself , i have lived for him .: 18.85
<S> edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend , then , taking up the knife , he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws , carefully administered the appointed number of drops , and anxiously awaited the result .: 114.85
<S> athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd .: 26.18
<S> yes , i did wait yes , i did hope , count , and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking together , you have unconsciously wounded , tortured my heart , for every word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me .: 51.62
<S> the hour of dinner soon arrived .: 52.19
<S> except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.f.3 , this work is provided to you as is , with no other warranties of any kind , express or implied , including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose .: 36.67
<S> do you mean at rome ? i do . ah , then , i suppose you heard hayde e s guzla ; the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native land . morcerf did not pursue the subject , and monte cristo himself fell into a silent reverie .: 72.17
<S> i was there at a fearful moment .: 24.33
<S> two lackeys dragged milady , whom each held by one arm .: 147.09
<S> let each take seventy five ; that is enough to take us to london and back .: 94.52
<S> nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin . that s all very well , replied d artagnan ; but i am tired of fearing when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of milady . you are very fastidious , said athos ; such a beautiful woman ! a woman of mark ! said porthos , with his loud laugh .: 51.23
<S> i always had a desire to have a mute in my service , so learning the day his tongue was cut out , i went to the bey , and proposed to give him for ali a splendid double barreled gun , which i knew he was very desirous of having .: 54.56
<S> although he professes to be my enemy i have sympathy for him , and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters . comminges bowed , and returned to athos , who was awaiting with apparent calmness , but with real anxiety , the result of the interview .: 59.80
<S> it is not he , she murmured , and waited , in the assurance that this was but a dream , for the man to disappear or assume some other form .: 45.88
<S> d artagnan had appointed six o clock in the morning for his lackey , and wherever he might be , he was right .: 21.16
<S> should we not do better in the grottos ? what grottos ? why , the grottos caves of the island . i do not know of any grottos , replied jacopo .: 50.29
<S> the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like turks , or even tailors .: 46.46
<S> henrietta maria and mazarin .: 101.81
<S> let us drink . then she is dead ? stammered d artagnan .: 16.26
<S> short and stout . who is it ? they all asked together in a low tone .: 58.70
<S> yes , at present , continued lord de winter , you will remain in this castle .: 18.07
<S> besides , it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life . thus dante s , who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough , and panted for wealth .: 99.14
<S> my god !: 11.06
<S> believe me , it is only the evil minded who deny friendship ; they can not understand it .: 48.29
<S> peppino placed himself beside ali , and they set off at a rapid pace .: 32.42
<S> in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best .: 62.31
<S> and , to complete the whole , hayde e was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charms she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers .: 71.21
<S> they have some business with you , i think , from what they told me the day before yesterday .: 25.19
<S> planchet took the crossroad , and by seven o clock in the morning he was at armentie res .: 13.16
<S> who calls me ? i , said mazarin , with his most smiling expression .: 23.65
<S> she went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre .: 32.32
<S> the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal .: 81.22
<S> ah ! said d artagnan with a smile , you sell your productions at their weight in gold .: 33.35
<S> let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see ; i can tell you nothing more at present . go ahead , my friend , said athos ; i am sure that whatever you do is well done . and you , aramis , are you of that opinion ? entirely so , my dear d artagnan . very good , said d artagnan ; here indeed are true believers ; it is a pleasure to work miracles before them ; they are not like that unbelieving porthos , who must see and touch before he will believe . the fact is , said porthos , with an air of finesse , i am rather incredulous . d artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder , and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast , the conversation ended there .: 50.06
<S> they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way , and then were stopped by , who comes there ? at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel .: 34.85
<S> m. d avrigny warned me of it .: 18.29
<S> oh , yes , especially beautiful .: 26.26
<S> clear sky , swift flitting boats , and brilliant sunshine disappeared ; the heavens were hung with black , and the gigantic structure of the cha teau d if seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy .: 38.61
<S> the sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene .: 59.07
<S> if so , you can spare yourself the trouble . no , said mazarin ; although , perhaps , that counsel is as good as any other . then what may it be ? to call for monsieur le coadjuteur . the coadjutor ! cried the queen , that dreadful mischief maker !: 45.54
<S> project gutenberg is a registered trademark , and may not be used if you charge for an ebook , except by following the terms of the trademark license , including paying royalties for use of the project gutenberg trademark .: 18.23
<S> he , my thief ! replied d artagnan .: 15.34
<S> at the end of three months he had learned to write .: 11.63
<S> parry , too , started and stopped reading .: 98.66
<S> i know his character ; he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests .: 74.09
<S> then , all at once , he replied , with that logic which the reader has , doubtless , remarked in him , there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn ; instead of being astonished , let me dress myself . and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris .: 64.48
<S> it must be allowed that andrea was not very handsome , the hideous scoundrel !: 54.91
<S> two horses that monsieur de tre ville lends me at my pleasure , and with which i am now going to take a ride to st. germain . well , and what are you going to do at st. germain ? then demanded athos .: 27.63
<S> hardly , however , had he taken ten steps before he returned .: 33.49
<S> hang it ! cried d artagnan , another twenty pistoles lost .: 38.85
<S> if i made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith .: 82.89
<S> when they entered d artagnan s chamber , it was empty ; the landlord , dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger , had , consistent with the character he had given himself , judged it prudent to decamp .: 55.25
<S> and you , too , my poor monsieur mouston , are out of place in this poor hotel , are you not ? asked d artagnan , in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery .: 39.20
<S> no , thank you . do you wish anything ? leave me to pray . the count withdrew without opposition , but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of morrel , who at length arose , brushed the dust from his knees , and turned towards paris , without once looking back .: 43.49
<S> that puts a different face on the matter .: 76.24
<S> believe your own eyes . m. de boville took the paper danglars presented him , and read : received of baron danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand francs , to be repaid on demand by the house of thomson french of rome . it is really true , said m. de boville .: 46.02
<S> if you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation .: 21.77
<S> you great people always lose something by scandal , notwithstanding your millions .: 145.01
<S> at six in the evening the guests began to come .: 28.29
<S> and who cares now about yanina , which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or 1823 ? that just shows the meanness of this slander .: 136.52
<S> he had assigned himself the task of saving a man s life that day ; chance caused that man to be myself .: 79.10
<S> ah ! cried he , on perceiving d artagnan , ah !: 9.39
<S> in dying , i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron : eo rus , and all will be over . but come , franz , take courage , your wife is an heiress . indeed , beauchamp , you are unbearable .: 89.11
<S> seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage , he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to , and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without , however , arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them .: 76.84
<S> he motioned to valentine to approach .: 41.85
<S> cavalcanti s ? asked beauchamp .: 51.94
<S> good , replied athos , whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty ; tell the captain we are coming . the puritan then went out .: 63.25
<S> the letter is still to be seen , for it is in franz d e pinay s possession , signed by me , and with a postscript of m. luigi vampa .: 40.18
<S> and gabrielle d estrees as good natured , as brave , as proud , and above all , as gascon as his ancestor , but less elaborately educated .: 144.32
<S> or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight ?: 95.48
<S> well , signor pastrini , said franz , now that my companion is quieted , and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are , tell me who is this luigi vampa .: 41.09
<S> mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law , preparations on both sides were commenced by the queen , to attack paris , by the citizens , to defend it .: 90.57
<S> what we want , replied one , is to communicate to you the will of his highness .: 39.01
<S> when i am at the mercy of every scribbler in the palais royal who covers waste paper with nonsense , or of every country squire in the kingdom . nevertheless , you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like ! that is to say , whom you do not like , returned the queen .: 42.90
<S> then , the effort having exhausted her strength , she fell , not asleep this time , but fainting on the floor .: 74.77
<S> perhaps god will pardon you , but i , never ! for pity s sake , said the executioner , extending his arms .: 26.31
<S> come , come give it to me !: 21.62
<S> i wish to consult you on this passage , molli fugiens anhelitu , you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf .: 65.55
<S> it is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place .: 31.47
<S> one step nearer , said comminges , putting down the sashes , that the interior of the carriage might be well seen , and placing his sword on his prisoner s breast , one step nearer , and i kill the prisoner ; my orders were to carry him off alive or dead .: 47.72
<S> you can sleep here . yes ; do stay , added la carconte in a tremulous voice ; we will take every care of you . no ; i must sleep at beaucaire .: 41.64
<S> athos imparted to him his greatness of soul , porthos his enthusiasm , aramis his elegance .: 153.08
<S> go on , said the abbe ; it seems as if i were listening to the story of a dream .: 16.05
<S> to such a degree , i assure you , though i would not say so to others , that if the queen , acknowledging the injuries she has done me , would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty , which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death , well !: 49.43
<S> often , before his captivity , dante s mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners , made up of thieves , vagabonds , and murderers .: 76.67
<S> before he had spoken a word , the count saw in the next room a veiled woman , who had followed closely after baptistin , and now , seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table , rushed in .: 40.58
<S> valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear euge nie .: 100.34
<S> i inquired immediately on my return to paris ; the house had not been inhabited since we left it , but it had just been let for nine years .: 47.59
<S> with the queen i double her risk ; after the queen her departure would double mine ; then , the court once safe , i might be forgotten .: 114.02
<S> we are first , said morrel , looking out of the window .: 13.15
<S> the voices soon ceased , and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell .: 34.77
<S> i do not know why , but i imagine that this woman , wholly unknown to me as she is , and wholly unknown to her as i am , has an influence over my life . well , perhaps you are right , said athos .: 21.93
<S> listen , said she ; i yield to your protestations , i yield to your assurances .: 34.22
<S> this time i will know the assassin , and will pursue him . let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her , said d avrigny .: 39.43
<S> i know not why , but i feel that this crime you acknowledge , then , the existence of the crime ? yes , i see too plainly that it does exist .: 42.80
<S> although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent , it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century .: 79.72
<S> have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano ? said danglars to andrea .: 47.25
<S> then the castle of saint angelo fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won .: 135.56
<S> the poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female could be guilty of such perfidy ; besides , the name of the comtesse de winter , which she had heard the abbess pronounce , was wholly unknown to her , and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so fatal a share in the misfortune of her life .: 42.43
<S> you will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs ; spend them if necessary , but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve , that is to say , like kings . the queen had two letters ready , one written by herself , the other by her daughter , the princess henrietta .: 54.64
<S> god s death , don t fire ! screamed d artagnan , throwing open the window .: 23.76
<S> what a beautiful creature ! cried valentine ; why did you not bring him close to the gate , so that i could talk to him and pat him ? he is , as you see , a very valuable animal , said maximilian .: 34.69
<S> it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation .: 65.29
<S> you pity me , little one ? said d artagnan .: 19.22
<S> the young girl did not speak ; but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father s breast .: 19.80
<S> and i keep my word .: 22.15
<S> there is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never meet ; and popular proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth . oh , go on , monsieur , go on ! said madame de chevreuse eagerly ; you can t imagine how much this conversation interests me . you encourage me , said athos , i will continue , then .: 54.87
<S> if anyone had said to your father , at the moment he raised the pistol to his head if anyone had told me , when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three days if anyone had said to either of us then , live the day will come when you will be happy , and will bless life ! no matter whose voice had spoken , we should have heard him with the smile of doubt , or the anguish of incredulity , and yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing you how often have i myself ah , exclaimed morrel , interrupting the count , you had only lost your liberty , my father had only lost his fortune , but i have lost valentine . look at me , said monte cristo , with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasive look at me .: 65.26
<S> the expression of the count s face had not remained unperceived by the banker ; he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before , and said : you may , perhaps , be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars . a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count , and making a violent effort over himself , he said : i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation .: 38.91
<S> he sought to open it ; lock and padlock were fastened ; these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust .: 68.91
<S> for example , supposing it were the daughter of a banker , he might take an interest in the house of the father in law of his son ; then again , if he disliked his choice , the major takes the key , double locks his coffer , and master andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a parisian family , by shuffling cards or rattling the dice . ah , that boy will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess ; he will want a crown , an el dorado , and potosi . no ; these grand lords on the other side of the alps frequently marry into plain families ; like jupiter , they like to cross the race .: 96.93
<S> parbleu ! that s good , said albert , with a gloomy tone .: 23.08
<S> do not copy , display , perform , distribute or redistribute this electronic work , or any part of this electronic work , without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.e.1 with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the project gutenberg license .: 16.33
<S> tomorrow morning , at seven o clock , you will be with me , will you not ? we will . hush , the curtain is rising .: 21.66
<S> and yet if we burn it , who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes ? he must have one , said athos .: 61.65
<S> he moved away , walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts , and then went back and listened .: 36.10
<S> aha , said groslow ; on account of political opinions ?: 117.96
<S> d artagnan dismissed planchet , and requested his visitor to be seated .: 25.20
<S> the young officer stood upright before her , awaiting her words as if to devour them .: 43.51
<S> was seen yesterday at gabrielle s .: 114.62
<S> at the language you use . what do you find so astonishing in that language ? said milady , smiling .: 42.62
<S> more than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard .: 42.19
<S> all i can say is , continued the countess , taking up the lorgnette , and directing it toward the box in question , that the gentleman , whose history i am unable to furnish , seems to me as though he had just been dug up ; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave digger to quit his tomb for a while , and revisit this earth of ours , than anything human .: 75.47
<S> he was still comparatively young , he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family , but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning , illogical perhaps , yet certainly plausible , that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world , even life itself .: 83.30
<S> i am at present in the midst of war , and am about to deliver a decisive battle against king charles .: 48.17
<S> information about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non profit 501 c 3 educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the internal revenue service .: 8.09
<S> two men , seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid , were eating their breakfasts , while waiting for the criminal .: 71.04
<S> before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye ; but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition .: 190.02
<S> where do you keep your wine ? no , no ; thanks .: 32.34
<S> bonacieux , holding out her hand to him , and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall .: 27.86
<S> besides , i care not for his displeasure . still , situated as we are yes , do you know how we are situated ?: 66.51
<S> a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common , every day sort of attachment such as ours .: 116.03
<S> richelieu slowly tore the paper which d artagnan had generously relinquished .: 75.11
<S> apropos , continued he , franz is coming soon , but it will not interest you ; you dislike him , i think ? i ? said monte cristo ; my dear viscount , how have you discovered that i did not like m. franz !: 38.40
<S> remember that i never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived .: 100.94
<S> then that person is a most amiable person . albert looked around and perceived franz .: 49.48
<S> i never had one !: 48.88
<S> patrick , remain here , or rather join the king , wherever he may be , and tell his majesty that i humbly beg him to excuse me , but an affair of the greatest importance recalls me to london .: 42.22
<S> there was once in the rue des tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of paris , and yet , nevertheless , this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man .: 48.89
<S> in leaving the palais royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow .: 39.39
<S> when well assured this search was superfluous , he followed d artagnan , wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality , and that he should know better than himself what had become of her .: 57.22
<S> impossible !: 26.49
<S> can t you guess , my dear athos ?: 39.57
<S> aramis was the next to come in and to discover athos almost insensible .: 78.25
<S> one word more , sir ; do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune m. cavalcanti will bring without touching the money ?: 69.60
<S> we owe nothing to our enemies ; and let me give you a piece of advice ; take care of yourself , monsieur d artagnan , for from the moment i withdraw my hand from behind you , i would not give an obolus for your life . i will try to do so , monseigneur , replied the gascon , with a noble confidence .: 26.11
<S> well , sir , what you tell me is impossible .: 25.70
<S> dante s , struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel , applied to its owner to transfer it to him , offering sixty thousand francs , upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession .: 48.75
<S> now for the wager !: 52.63
<S> have you seen the cardinal ? he sent for me , answered the mercer , proudly .: 22.66
<S> and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him .: 152.44
<S> yesterday s affair must have shaken him a little ; his voyage would upset him quite . planchet was sent for , and instructions were given him .: 106.87
<S> for instance , you shall see ; how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea time ? ma foi , i should like to smoke . monte cristo took the gong and struck it once .: 51.98
<S> this affair , like all those in which the count of monte cristo had interfered , caused a great sensation in paris .: 33.45
<S> bridle in mouth ! said d artagnan .: 31.79
<S> we are not such devils as we appear to be .: 30.74
<S> would you like such a post ?: 44.68
<S> i thought , said franz to the count , that you told me there would be but one execution . i told you true , replied he coldly .: 25.48
<S> good , said mazarin , i am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation . why do you say that ? asked the queen , almost timidly .: 15.35
<S> then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds , which , like the order , had been the gift of henrietta maria .: 30.75
<S> the procurator repeated several times , ah , madame coquenard !: 65.69
<S> sir , tis this very coating of fat that makes me shiver . how is that , mousqueton ?: 56.30
<S> he has ; he is an abbe . ah , what a misfortune ! exclaimed the duchess , playing carelessly with her fan .: 24.55
<S> it was as if the young girl beheld the head of medusa .: 31.53
<S> what are we to do , maltese ? asked the captain .: 16.91
<S> i have something better than that , said monte cristo ; i have a slave .: 14.94
<S> don t you agree with me , aramis ? entirely , my dear count .: 18.14
<S> ask baron franz d e pinay ; i think he tasted them one day . yes , replied morcerf , he said something about it to me . but , said beauchamp , who , as became a journalist , was very incredulous , you always carry this drug about you ? always . would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills ? continued beauchamp , hoping to take him at a disadvantage .: 63.78
<S> but you , he said , with that light dress , and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf , perhaps you feel cold ? do you know where i am leading you ? said the countess , without replying to the question .: 46.19
<S> kitty , fearing she was ill , hastened toward her and was beginning to open her dress ; but milady started up , pushing her away .: 71.79
<S> while d artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors , aramis had joined his companions ; so that on returning home d artagnan found the reunion complete .: 69.59
<S> it was about five o clock .: 8.15
<S> bravo ! cried mazarin ; they told me that you were the man i wanted .: 24.34
<S> sick of the smallpox at his age !: 84.21
<S> then they saw , as the felucca turned , two other heads peeping , those of aramis and grimaud .: 89.23
<S> that is my failing a capital failing , i admit ; but with that exception , i am a good drinker . athos spoke this in so natural a manner that d artagnan was shaken in his conviction .: 55.01
<S> having crossed paris , it passed through the faubourg du temple , then leaving the exterior boulevards , it reached the cemetery .: 70.96
<S> i will retire , madame .: 14.74
<S> why , this woman was a monster !: 20.19
<S> we will send my brother s servant back to be thune , whom , as i told you , we can trust .: 31.80
<S> the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed ; for he left his seat to stand up in front , so that , his countenance being fully revealed , franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of monte cristo , and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum , and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him .: 48.39
<S> yes .: 18.24
<S> there are the fifty louis , i faith , said aramis , emptying the purse on the table , all bearing the effigy of louis xiii .: 34.49
<S> appeared , walking fast .: 142.01
<S> you wish to know what i will do ? yes . i will find him , as i told you .: 12.11
<S> m. de saint me ran lived at marseilles , so that this country house was useless to him , and it was reported to be let to a young widow , known only by the name of the baroness . one evening , as i was looking over the wall , i saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden , which was not overlooked by any windows , and i guessed that she was awaiting m. de villefort .: 33.78
<S> you were rich , noble , held in great esteem had all that could render a man happy ? all , said the major , hastily swallowing his biscuit , positively all . and yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness ? only one thing , said the italian .: 67.40
<S> he now called himself du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds , and resided on his new estate .: 31.38
<S> he is , then , the same englishman whom i met at ah yes , indeed .: 42.16
<S> vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket , and slowly returned by the way he had gone .: 44.90
<S> it appears , said cromwell , that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well .: 70.25
<S> the hostess threw herself at his feet , asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence .: 43.49
<S> he took the key , which was customarily given him as one of the family , ascended the stairs , and introduced mme .: 27.18
<S> at what hour does the examination take place ? at two o clock . send at twelve , said danglars , smiling .: 35.28
<S> my mother gave it to me , and i , fool as i was , instead of keeping the ring as a holy relic , gave it to this wretch . then , my friend , take back this ring , to which i see you attach much value . i take back the ring , after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature ?: 43.34
<S> blaisois found bazin donning his beadle s gown , his services being required that day at notre dame .: 99.21
<S> patrick discreetly kept in the background .: 135.60
<S> my father has not yet forgotten me , i am sure , but god alone knows if she loves me still ; i shall love you as i loved my father . it is well , returned the voice ; tomorrow . these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity ; dante s rose , dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before , and pushed his bed back against the wall .: 36.66
<S> valentine looked at m. d avrigny with astonishment , kissed her grandfather on the forehead , and left the room .: 22.36
<S> twenty four years ago i returned , proud and joyful , to my country .: 66.97
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> i will descend with my eyes shut . have you confidence in me ? said felton .: 35.95
<S> the terrified servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass .: 35.30
<S> good ! thought d artagnan , she is charged with some message for me from her mistress ; she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she had not courage to speak . and he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air imaginable .: 39.55
<S> from being slender he had now become meagre ; once pale , he was now yellow ; his deep set eyes were hollow , and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face .: 72.33
<S> but porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant , and when mousqueton rose above the water , blind as a new born puppy , he found he was supported by the large hand of porthos and that he was thus enabled , without having occasion even to move , to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton .: 54.46
<S> but athos might be said to bear a charmed life .: 86.76
<S> leave the saucepan , said dante s ; you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast . this advice was to the jailer s taste , as it spared him the necessity of making another trip .: 45.48
<S> dear grandpapa , cried she , what has happened ?: 18.93
<S> these can not be for us , said athos .: 18.07
<S> you have no idea , my friend , how my bones ache since i came here .: 54.44
<S> he glanced around , in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn , and seemed to fall easily on a topic .: 60.29
<S> do you think that i sorrow for madame danglars ?: 35.20
<S> do as you like with your own , but do not fill or empty mine .: 76.79
<S> proceed , said the president .: 12.51
<S> she continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes , and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round once .: 79.26
<S> you arrive in good time , monsieur , said the king , who , when his passions were raised to a certain point , could not dissemble ; i have learned some fine things concerning your musketeers . and i , said tre ville , coldly , i have some pretty things to tell your majesty concerning these gownsmen . what ? said the king , with hauteur .: 39.09
<S> at that moment they heard the gallop of a horse .: 21.22
<S> but the first was repugnant to him .: 14.34
<S> ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left ; valentine , who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly , incapable of controlling her ideas , was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images .: 84.98
<S> dante s from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel , and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors .: 93.53
<S> it is because , at your theatres , by what at least i could judge by reading the pieces they play , they see persons swallow the contents of a phial , or suck the button of a ring , and fall dead instantly .: 97.90
<S> d artagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the ferryman to read the billet of mme .: 24.50
<S> mark !: 51.52
<S> now , the queen is of a sensitive nature .: 45.69
<S> i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle a stab with a knife , for instance . and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward , said debray .: 50.76
<S> but he will make it up in you i am sure .: 39.92
<S> well , monsieur , he is still here . ah , pardieu ! my dear dame , said d artagnan , springing from his horse , and throwing the bridle to planchet , you restore me to life ; where is this dear aramis ?: 23.25
<S> may i , at least , return ? asked morrel .: 20.04
<S> i have brought her here , sir , and i have deposited her in charge of charlotte , who , till better advice comes , has bathed the foot in cold well water . the guests now all took leave of athos , excepting the old duc de barbe , who , as an old friend of the family of la valliere , went to see little louise and offered to take her to blois in his carriage .: 75.69
<S> d artagnan , who , as we have said , was exceedingly prudent for a young man of twenty , then remembered his suspicions regarding milady .: 29.17
<S> the fifth sharer in edmond s bequest , was his own father . too true , too true ! ejaculated caderousse , almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him , the poor old man did die . i learned so much at marseilles , replied the abbe , making a strong effort to appear indifferent ; but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder dante s , i was unable to obtain any particulars of his end .: 33.92
<S> monsieur the cardinal ! cried the stupefied musketeer .: 21.46
<S> toward six o clock m. de tre ville announced that it was time to go to the louvre ; but as the hour of audience granted by his majesty was past , instead of claiming the entre e by the back stairs , he placed himself with the four young men in the antechamber .: 34.65
<S> you are disputing which shall fight me first , but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter .: 68.97
<S> we profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere .: 72.73
<S> but is it the custom for the officers in the english navy to place themselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in a port of great britain , and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct them ashore ? yes , madame , it is the custom , not from gallantry but prudence , that in time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular ho tels , in order that they may remain under the eye of the government until full information can be obtained about them . these words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calmness .: 65.38
<S> tis god who gives them into our hands , answered groslow .: 58.66
<S> the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres ; that is , not in listening to the music , but in paying visits and conversing .: 99.96
<S> ay ! said he , i see ; but you shall not kill me today .: 23.75
<S> julie , mindful of emmanuel s request , was following her father when he quitted the room , but he said to her quickly : remain with your mother , dearest . julie wished to accompany him .: 50.37
<S> there , said the young man , handing kitty the letter sealed ; give that to milady .: 52.64
<S> now , said planchet , let us thank the queen .: 16.44
<S> but , after all , he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that france has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him . oh !: 68.85
<S> felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door , and waited without speaking a word , without making a gesture .: 30.94
<S> it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement .: 27.24
<S> he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty ; he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to buckingham , and all with a tranquillity and candor of which m. de tre ville was the more the dupe , from having himself , as we have said , observed something fresh between the cardinal , the king , and the queen .: 38.83
<S> d artagnan , hearing the musketeer swear , wished to escape from the cloak , which blinded him , and sought to find his way from under the folds of it .: 44.49
<S> yesterday morning , madame . coming , as usual , i presume , from the extreme end of the globe ?: 53.70
<S> mazarin arose , walked some moments , thoughtful , but not dejected .: 77.94
<S> here i am , albert said .: 25.29
<S> in short , doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the world , and although i place the utmost reliance in you , i want , notwithstanding my conviction , to believe this axiom , errare humanum est . is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself ? why do you ask me that ? what do you wish ? send for him ; i will tell him what i have seen , and we will consult together , and examine the body . and you will find traces of poison ? no , i did not say of poison , but we can prove what was the state of the body ; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death , and we shall say , dear villefort , if this thing has been caused by negligence , watch over your servants ; if from hatred , watch your enemies . what do you propose to me , d avrigny ? said villefort in despair ; so soon as another is admitted into our secret , an inquest will become necessary ; and an inquest in my house impossible !: 58.38
<S> tell your mistress , he at length answered , that i wish to speak to her , and i beg she will wait for me in her own room . yes , sir . then come to dress and shave me . directly , sir . the valet re appeared almost instantly , and , having shaved his master , assisted him to dress entirely in black .: 56.86
<S> it would quite cut me up . you are a very odd man , athos , he replied , to doubt me thus .: 37.93
<S> one would say you were carrying me off . and they would be right , pardieu ! oh , i think you swore , euge nie . and the two young girls , whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief , the one on her own account , the other from interest in her friend , burst out laughing , as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape .: 58.03
<S> eh ?: 58.00
<S> i hate you , and on my word you shall pay for this ! at the moment she spoke these words a rap on the ceiling made her raise her head , and a voice which reached her through the ceiling cried , dear madame bonacieux , open for me the little door on the alley , and i will come down to you . chapter xviii .: 41.61
<S> they sat down to dinner .: 19.73
<S> when at three paces distant from each other , albert and the count stopped .: 49.74
<S> the valet ran directly .: 52.47
<S> pardon me for interrupting you , but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me . possibly , monsieur .: 28.87
<S> he credited this woman , who appeared to him the equal of a demon , with agents as supernatural as herself ; at the least noise , he imagined himself about to be arrested , and that planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends .: 59.22
<S> an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head , saying , i thought so ! and sliding from the shoulders of dante s as dextrously as he had ascended , he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground .: 46.03
<S> quick ! returned the abbe , listen to what i have to say . dante s looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of faria , whose eyes , already dull and sunken , were surrounded by purple circles , while his lips were white as those of a corpse , and his very hair seemed to stand on end .: 41.95
<S> and since i do not give it , said the musketeer .: 13.31
<S> it was saddled and bridled .: 35.82
<S> the antechamber of m. de tre ville m. de troisville , as his family was still called in gascony , or m. de tre ville , as he has ended by styling himself in paris , had really commenced life as d artagnan now did ; that is to say , without a sou in his pocket , but with a fund of audacity , shrewdness , and intelligence which makes the poorest gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal inheritance than the richest perigordian or berrichan gentleman derives in reality from his .: 82.58
<S> bonacieux , in a voice almost caressing , and pressing the hand of d artagnan , who had not relinquished hers , well : i will not say as much as you do ; what is lost for today may not be lost forever .: 44.01
<S> i have met him several times at florence , bologna and lucca , and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris .: 25.58
<S> let us see if she shuts the door after him , he muttered .: 19.28
<S> diable ! he said , after having swallowed the divine preserve .: 39.62
<S> you have been to yanina ? said he .: 21.74
<S> here is my bed , replied planchet , producing a bundle of straw .: 31.45
<S> yes , look at yourself in that glass ; you have turned pale and then red successively , three or four times in one minute . indeed , cried euge nie , you are very pale ! oh , do not be alarmed ; i have been so for many days . artless as she was , the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave , and besides , madame de villefort came to her assistance .: 35.54
<S> de chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse .: 32.50
<S> d artagnan !: 11.49
<S> the officer leaped to the pier , and offered his hand to milady .: 21.78
<S> you have been to london !: 28.73
<S> faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt .: 52.30
<S> see to these horses .: 114.15
<S> she made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses ; only she did not respond to them .: 29.18
<S> he hastened with franz to seat himself , free to recommence the discussion after dinner .: 87.85
<S> at the moment when he opened the door , such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished .: 27.65
<S> it is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the guards of monsieur the cardinal ; monsieur de tre ville must think us dead . to a certainty , athos , said aramis , you were meant to be a general of the army !: 25.70
<S> oh , nothing but a scratch , said d artagnan .: 13.79
<S> a high wall surrounded the whole of the property , surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers , and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron , which served as the carriage entrance .: 43.55
<S> and you have succeeded , exclaimed d avrigny .: 22.26
<S> i am , as i trust you do not doubt , your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds . well , said aramis , what do you say to that ? i say , my dear d herblay , that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends , and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos , as we divided the louis sent by d artagnan . the division being made by the light of bazin s taper , the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis .: 37.28
<S> unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly , he replied : they ?: 127.19
<S> as franz was about to take leave of m. de villefort , when shall i see you again ? said the latter .: 16.48
<S> his whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness , only an unusual fire beamed from his eyes , like the effects of a fever ; his brow was more pale than it generally was ; his teeth were clenched , and his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at work within him .: 62.86
<S> d artagnan jumped into the saddle , then the old companions in arms again shook hands .: 33.41
<S> let us to bed ! and athos went out of the parpaillot , followed by d artagnan .: 18.54
<S> and you paid him out of the two hundred francs i left you ? the old man nodded .: 24.87
<S> the men i have put to flight will return reinforced ; if they find us here , we are lost .: 62.43
<S> my !: 61.16
<S> ah , you fear your prisoner should escape ! said she .: 39.15
<S> teresa uttered a cry of joy , and , without inquiring whence this attire came , or even thanking luigi , darted into the grotto , transformed into a dressing room .: 39.63
<S> try , aramis , to keep near the king .: 33.96
<S> i am uneasy about blaisois , said athos ; he can , he says , only swim in rivers . when people can swim at all they can swim anywhere .: 108.96
<S> of intrigues and secrets of state , continued d artagnan , complying with the recommendation .: 49.37
<S> it was d artagnan , who was waiting for him .: 6.47
<S> porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the swiss .: 51.76
<S> the prince assigned the count de guiche to his father and kept bragelonne near his own person ; but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them .: 52.74
<S> the prince read as he hastened on .: 67.16
<S> what is this gentleman s name ? asked the commissary .: 9.83
<S> but , instead of growing easier , dante s pains appeared to increase in violence .: 59.08
<S> i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three ; for monsieur athos has the right to kill me first , which must much diminish the face value of your bill , monsieur porthos , and render yours almost null , monsieur aramis .: 87.23
<S> ask him , sir , if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of this house on the night of madame de saint me ran s death .: 21.74
<S> d artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys ; he remained on horseback , feeling no inclination to dismount , and sat looking at the bars , at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat , but by which he had for twenty years been awe struck .: 50.98
<S> true , he replied , and my protector is very kind . that dear protector , said caderousse ; and how much does he give you monthly ? five thousand francs . as many thousands as you give me hundreds !: 53.23
<S> this time danglars had double reason to understand , for if the word and gesture had not explained the speaker s meaning , it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him , who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the guide .: 62.98
<S> would you like to hear the story , sir ? yes ; relate it , said monte cristo , pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings ; he felt afraid of hearing his own history .: 29.99
<S> the more we have ventured the more we gain , when we know how to wait . yes ; but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners . bah ! said athos .: 70.37
<S> now there remains the chevalier , or the abbe d herblay , as your majesty pleases . does he wish to be a bishop ? no , madame , something easier to grant . what ? it is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of madame de longueville . the queen smiled .: 28.12
<S> certainly , said monte cristo , slightly shrugging his shoulders ; otherwise i would not fight with m. de morcerf .: 24.63
<S> he says you were the sun of rome , and that without you all appears dark and cloudy ; i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains . his opinion of me is altered for the better , then ? no , he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings . he is a charming young man , said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction , when i met him in search of a supper , and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine .: 61.20
<S> general oliver cromwell . the four friends looked at one another .: 17.08
<S> time was getting on , however , and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert ; but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber , his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day .: 54.72
<S> do you know the assassin ? asked morrel .: 8.68
<S> a little sooner or a little later , it isn t worth quarreling over . if i am astonished at anything , remarked porthos , sententiously , it is that it has not already happened . oh , it will happen , you may be sure , said d artagnan .: 40.48
<S> you know well that i don t like to leave things half finished . conclude , then , sir , answered de chatillon , with as much hauteur as aramis .: 40.07
<S> coquenard .: 51.74
<S> well , said caderousse , why don t you come ?: 13.23
<S> at a hundred paces from the gates of calais , d artagnan s horse gave out , and could not by any means be made to get up again , the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose .: 30.95
<S> he took to his heels , and was soon at m. de tre ville s ; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd , he asked to be introduced to m. de tre ville s office .: 17.21
<S> look d artagnan ; everybody is looking at her ; and in spite of bradshaw s gaze she has not turned pale . it is lady fairfax herself , said d artagnan .: 55.57
<S> never sell it ; allow it to die tranquilly and honorably of old age , and if you make a campaign with it , take as much care of it as you would of an old servant .: 71.97
<S> that he has given the diamond to us only ? inquired caderousse , half bewildered with joy ; yes , nothing more true !: 50.39
<S> were i in her majesty s place , said gondy , coldly , i should not hesitate ; i should release broussel . and if i do not give him up , what think you will be the result ? exclaimed the queen .: 36.01
<S> my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern .: 50.03
<S> diable ! when a churchman is killed , it should be with a different weapon than a log , especially when he has behaved like a father .: 75.56
<S> go , for i see how impatient you are . then i have leave ? go , i tell you . may i have the use of your skiff ? certainly . then , for the present , m. morrel , farewell , and a thousand thanks ! i hope soon to see you again , my dear edmond .: 31.96
<S> no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain , and had taken advantage of my confidence in it , the better to assure my ruin , so coolly resolved upon , so cruelly pursued .: 120.19
<S> i am at home to nobody , said milady ; observe , to nobody . the servant went out .: 29.50
<S> and i , too , edmond oh !: 25.07
<S> had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed oven .: 27.56
<S> what is that ? asked d artagnan .: 4.06
<S> in a moment or two the conversation ceased , and the three guardsmen and the musketeer , after having cordially shaken hands , separated , the guardsmen going one way and aramis another .: 87.46
<S> when you wish to obtain some concession from a man s self love , you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it . i believe you are right . i am glad of it . then i will go alone . go ; but you would do better still by not going at all . that is impossible . do so , then ; it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed . but if , in spite of all my precautions , i am at last obliged to fight , will you not be my second ? my dear viscount , said monte cristo gravely , you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places i have been at your disposal , but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you . why ? perhaps you may know at some future period , and in the mean time i request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons . well , i will have franz and cha teau renaud ; they will be the very men for it . do so , then . but if i do fight , you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing ? that , too , is impossible . what a singular being you are ! you will not interfere in anything . you are right that is the principle on which i wish to act . we will say no more about it , then .: 44.09
<S> three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants ; one of them alone arrived at the port , having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him .: 68.06
<S> dearest , exclaimed valentine , with her adorable smile , awake , and look at me ! morrel uttered a loud exclamation , and frantic , doubtful , dazzled , as though by a celestial vision , he fell upon his knees .: 44.68
<S> a boatman , who had passed by rogliano , and who had several of these animals , whose tricks had greatly diverted him , had , doubtless , suggested this idea to him .: 55.15
<S> he added that he did not know either m. or mme .: 39.20
<S> this edifice which i have been so long preparing , which i have reared with so much care and toil , is to be crushed by a single touch , a word , a breath !: 59.01
<S> here it is ! the hostler , enchanted with the good day s work he had done , returned to the yard .: 56.90
<S> he then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament ; then he re opened them , and stood motionless with amazement .: 63.00
<S> he was alone again !: 31.34
<S> franz coolly cocked both barrels .: 258.96
<S> julie returned , holding the silken purse in her hands , while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks , like dewdrops on the rose .: 53.47
<S> grimaud sprang up .: 29.45
<S> and i am madame he loi se de villefort . the count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time .: 23.39
<S> and now , what do you want ? oh , how extraordinary !: 10.22
<S> indeed , i feel quite sure , from the cut of his clothes , they are made by a first rate paris tailor probably blin or humann .: 122.98
<S> she had , however , just power to give one parting look to her grandfather , who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul .: 62.55
<S> here is de winter coming , said athos .: 32.15
<S> shall we go forward ?: 36.51
<S> they continued to admire it , but said no more about it ; and with a rapid change of thought , the conversation passed suddenly to another subject .: 56.75
<S> what upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another .: 55.65
<S> and how did he treat you ? with more of mildness than severity . did you tell him your whole story ? i did . and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination ? he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape .: 57.12
<S> now let us talk the matter over quietly , said the count .: 35.60
<S> milady knew she might be watched , so she continued her prayers to the end ; and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step , and seemed to listen .: 40.04
<S> let things take their course ; perhaps you may not have to retract . bah ! said albert , staring .: 58.69
<S> we shall go out all the same . do you know , my dear fellow , why master pastrycooks never work with their hands ? no , said porthos , but i should be glad to be informed . it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked . what then ? why , then they would be laughed at , and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at . and what have master pastrycooks to do with us ? we ought , in our adventures , never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us .: 73.28
<S> i had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the arabian nights , a wizard of the middle ages ; but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths , when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence .: 93.32
<S> sometimes he weeps bitterly , sometimes laughs boisterously , at other time he passes hours on the seashore , flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes duck and drake five or six times , he appears as delighted as if he had gained another marengo or austerlitz .: 137.43
<S> suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass , advanced , grew in size , and as they loomed up larger and larger , assumed the appearance of two horsemen .: 88.27
<S> when the patron awoke , the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set , and every sail full with the breeze .: 74.98
<S> he took the opportunity of calling out his guard , the swiss troops and the musketeers , and he had planted them round the palais royal , on the quays , and on the pont neuf .: 25.94
<S> we can therefore use up four horses as well as one .: 51.17
<S> at the hour agreed upon groslow came .: 65.54
<S> or , as you are a corsican , that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff , as you call it . yes , my good master , cried bertuccio , casting himself at the count s feet , it was simply vengeance nothing else . i understand that , but i do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this manner . but , monsieur , it is very natural , returned bertuccio , since it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished . what !: 28.07
<S> morrel opened the door , and closed it behind his son ; then , crossing the anteroom , went to his desk on which he placed the pistols , and pointed with his finger to an open ledger .: 28.38
<S> i congratulate you .: 18.07
<S> the sudden extinction of the moccoletti , the darkness which had replaced the light , and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil , had left in franz s mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness .: 63.22
<S> all i do know is , that i was just nineteen when i was arrested , the 28th of february , 1815. not quite twenty six ! murmured the voice ; at that age he can not be a traitor . oh , no , no , cried dante s .: 39.60
<S> you , chevalier d herblay , to his left .: 29.95
<S> on their side , from time to time , the besiegers took the messengers which the rochellais sent to buckingham , or the spies which buckingham sent to the rochellais .: 60.97
<S> the proofs , the proofs ! said the president ; remember this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs . the proofs ? said benedetto , laughing ; do you want proofs ? yes . well , then , look at m. de villefort , and then ask me for proofs . everyone turned towards the procureur , who , unable to bear the universal gaze now riveted on him alone , advanced staggering into the midst of the tribunal , with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark of his nails .: 39.34
<S> madame de villefort , who was alone in her drawing room when the count was announced , desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count ; and edward , who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days , made all possible haste to come to him , not from obedience to his mother , or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count , but from sheer curiosity , and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say : oh , that naughty child !: 66.35
<S> madame , said he , you are about to receive a visit from the chancellor , who will communicate certain matters to you with which i have charged him . the unfortunate queen , who was constantly threatened with divorce , exile , and trial even , turned pale under her rouge , and could not refrain from saying , but why this visit , sire ?: 43.13
<S> let us alight here , said athos .: 10.28
<S> at first , perhaps , he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the lord , but at last he took patience and waited .: 45.17
<S> creating the works from print editions not protected by u.s. copyright law means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works , so the foundation and you !: 24.03
<S> you can not think of going out in such weather as this . oh , i am not afraid of thunder , said the jeweller .: 27.04
<S> but i must not forget one grand point . which ? that i have been singularly assisted . nonsense . i have , indeed . by circumstances ? no ; by you . by me ?: 77.31
<S> this morning the subject was introduced , and my dear grandmother , on whom i depended as my only support , not only declared herself favorable to it , but is so anxious for it , that they only await the arrival of m. d e pinay , and the following day the contract will be signed . a deep sigh escaped the young man , who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved .: 46.89
<S> sir , she said to morcerf , you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master . this was said in excellent tuscan , and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer .: 41.56
<S> during the recital mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen .: 58.87
<S> no , i repeat again , that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almighty s pleasure . dante s held down his head , that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbe s plans .: 84.39
<S> come , he said , you have me in a snare , gentlemen .: 18.25
<S> you are welcome , monsieur , said milady , in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill humor which d artagnan had just remarked ; you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude . the englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single detail .: 77.50
<S> a letter from the king , perhaps .: 28.46
<S> the feather in his hat is worth at least five and twenty pistoles .: 39.03
<S> it is i , shouted a voice .: 19.52
<S> yes , he has entered . it is for you or me ! my god , how agitated you seem ! yes , i admit it .: 48.19
<S> then a sudden idea crossed the mind of d artagnan .: 20.51
<S> this parallel disturbed his usual politeness , the philosophy he witnessed appalled him , he muttered a few words of general civility and ran downstairs .: 87.43
<S> nevertheless , aramis was in a good situation , and able to defend himself .: 29.53
<S> forgive , edmond , forgive for my sake , who love you still ! the dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother .: 59.58
<S> do not give this key to your father , said he , and tomorrow morning , if possible , do not quit him for a moment . she questioned emmanuel , but he knew nothing , or would not say what he knew .: 30.55
<S> d artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge .: 25.74
<S> dispose of me , then , as a friend . but i where shall i go meanwhile ? is there nobody from whose house monsieur laporte can come and fetch you ? no , i can trust nobody . stop , said d artagnan ; we are near athos s door .: 53.72
<S> gentlemen , cried chatillon , the truce is broken , that is evident ; they are going to fight ; go , then , into charenton , for i shall begin in a short time there s a signal from the prince ! the cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the prince .: 53.03
<S> they are robbers , perhaps , he muttered .: 26.24
<S> at the moment caderousse quitted his sentry like watch before the door , the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday .: 80.32
<S> ah , true , said aramis .: 11.46
<S> the enemy ! cried the king .: 13.94
<S> of what ? asked the priest , anxiously and eagerly .: 23.37
<S> i gave my sister , who constantly defended the unfortunate boy , good advice , and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount , i showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future .: 85.15
<S> porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience .: 38.94
<S> he was not mistaken ; as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the window .: 29.59
<S> hark ye , my friend , i have disobeyed my first order , but i will not disobey the second ; and if you move , i will blow your brains out . and he levelled his carbine at dante s , who felt the muzzle against his temple .: 40.26
<S> the departure for belgium a few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of m. danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers , and by the disclosure which had followed , the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests .: 56.52
<S> just now , before i came down to you , i drank a glass of sugared water ; i left half , because it seemed so bitter . noirtier turned pale , and made a sign that he wished to speak .: 31.44
<S> these 900,000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital ; but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man , and i shall , therefore , act according to my conscience . having said this , villefort quitted the room with his wife , leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased .: 46.33
<S> but there are no more , said she .: 18.48
<S> and this is the more strange , since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night . grief has stunned him , replied d avrigny ; and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur s study .: 58.82
<S> they must set out the next morning at daybreak , and go to armentie res each by a different route .: 33.31
<S> the devil ! cried the host , at his wits end .: 23.13
<S> and d artagnan had time , therefore , to watch bazin unsuspected .: 49.17
<S> i threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall , that i mightn t break my promise and strangle grimaud . i doubt , however , said la ramee , in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate , if he has said anything disagreeable to your highness . pardieu !: 47.96
<S> pierced hearts ! said athos .: 54.64
<S> after a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man , who approached them , swimming vigorously .: 51.59
<S> he was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with ; but on timidly opening his eyes , he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of porthos that is to say , exactly upon the baldric .: 60.36
<S> why , if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention , her reputation would be gone forever . and the very reason why the women of this fine country , where sounds the si , as dante writes , put so little restraint on their words and actions , is because they live so much in public , and have really nothing to conceal .: 97.76
<S> pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting .: 80.72
<S> if he be innocent , of course he will be set at liberty ; if guilty , why , it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy . let us go , then .: 45.48
<S> on the sixteenth day , in particular , these signs were so strong in d artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place , and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected .: 43.51
<S> but what do you expect ?: 8.48
<S> the calash contained mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly .: 35.06
<S> think of that , valentine !: 31.86
<S> while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting , with the appetites of convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in misfortune , d artagnan related how aramis , being wounded , was obliged to stop at cre vec ur , how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four men who accused him of being a coiner , and how he , d artagnan , had been forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach england .: 72.83
<S> well ? one of these two men said , he must certainly be at noisy , or be coming there this evening , for i have seen his servant . art thou sure ? said the man in the cloak .: 35.76
<S> i am really sorry to go away without having seen grimaud . grimaud ! replied athos .: 30.29
<S> what granted me ? scarcely more .: 90.54
<S> meddle with your musketeers , and do not annoy me in this way .: 30.52
<S> the camp had entered saint omer ; the friends made a little detour and went to the camp , and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen .: 40.42
<S> to the boats , my lads , as quick as you can . now , continued penelon , you see , m. morrel , a sailor is attached to his ship , but still more to his life , so we did not wait to be told twice ; the more so , that the ship was sinking under us , and seemed to say , get along save yourselves . we soon launched the boat , and all eight of us got into it .: 56.50
<S> d e pinay was quite a child when his father died , he knows very little of m. noirtier , and will meet him , if not with pleasure , at least with indifference . is it a suitable match ? in every respect . and the young man ? is regarded with universal esteem . you approve of him ? he is one of the most well bred young men i know . during the whole of this conversation valentine had remained silent .: 52.34
<S> did you see him ? they all asked .: 40.87
<S> the twenty men marched straight toward the barrier , but from behind the beams , from among the wagon wheels and from the heights of the rocks a terrible fusillade burst forth and at the same time planchet s halberdiers appeared at the corner of the cemetery of the innocents , and louvieres s bourgeois at the corner of the rue de la monnaie .: 53.33
<S> die ?: 118.35
<S> i became alarmed , as any prosecution might be attended with serious consequences .: 128.57
<S> this idea completely restored clemency to his heart .: 93.78
<S> there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement .: 21.06
<S> as soon as there was room for rowing , his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly .: 65.78
<S> but three weeks had already passed , and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful ; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti .: 63.29
<S> my son , i bless thee ! the young man cast himself on his knees , leaning his head against the old man s bed .: 16.55
<S> besides , how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st .: 78.88
<S> he visited his own dungeon .: 60.93
<S> dante s remained in his cell all day , not daring to return to his friend , thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced , once for all , that the abbe was mad such a conviction would be so terrible !: 60.86
<S> the next day they kept their word , and thus they grew up together .: 33.60
<S> la chesnaye ! louis xiii . s confidential valet , who never left the door , entered in reply to the call .: 84.69
<S> i have seen so many remarkable things in him , that if you would have me really say what i think , i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byron s heroes , whom misery has marked with a fatal brand ; some manfred , some lara , some werner , one of those wrecks , as it were , of some ancient family , who , disinherited of their patrimony , have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius , which has placed them above the laws of society . you say i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean , without inhabitants or garrison , the resort of smugglers of all nations , and pirates of every flag .: 70.33
<S> my heart is that of a musketeer ; i feel it , monsieur , and that impels me on . withdraw , young man , cried jussac , who doubtless , by his gestures and the expression of his countenance , had guessed d artagnan s design .: 36.43
<S> the abbess introduced them to each other .: 38.14
<S> pardon , your majesty , he cried , but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors ; what are your commands ? listen , madame , said gondy .: 45.58
<S> he waited , then , in the ante chamber with impatience , till he should be conducted to them .: 29.11
<S> this singular passion for a child of seven may some day make him very unhappy .: 158.43
<S> a tigress , a panther !: 53.64
<S> you ? to interminable , ineffaceable infamy ! you ? repeated i. oh , i declare to you , felton , i thought him mad !: 86.78
<S> we do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names . but you , i presume , have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce ? i believe you , madame , to be a great and powerful queen , and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to saint germain . it is my intention so to do ; come , let us hear you .: 56.01
<S> monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum ; it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle d armilly , of whom he had heard much .: 25.92
<S> yes , and i take your brother with me . oh , count . said julie , will you restore him to us cured of his melancholy ? morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his countenance .: 38.12
<S> many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him ; many others said he would not appear ; while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels ; and others went to the police office to inquire if he had taken out a passport .: 67.52
<S> d artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when m. de tre ville entered .: 20.26
<S> the trial chapter 87 .: 27.12
<S> well , let my god save me , or let me perish for my god !: 39.84
<S> i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful , but most terrible manner , said he ; but valentine , poor girl , how will she bear so much sorrow ? as he thought thus , he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains .: 52.75
<S> bonacieux ; and mme .: 28.90
<S> they ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses , and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again immediately .: 31.93
<S> well ? said the cardinal , eagerly , rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the count .: 31.61
<S> alas , alas , alas ; all the world is wicked ; let us therefore strike at wickedness ! villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage , which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words .: 64.86
<S> you have come , then , at last !: 17.38
<S> the little old man remained at the coach door ; the coachman took care of his horses , the lackey held the saddlehorses .: 44.84
<S> he was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap , but his carefully arranged hair , beard and moustache , all of the richest and glossiest black , ill accorded with his plebeian attire .: 78.77
<S> the englishman was an original ; i had seen him conversing that morning with grimaud , and grimaud had told me that he had made him proposals to enter into his service .: 40.96
<S> oh , where will be the end ? villefort rushed into the room .: 23.64
<S> d artagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him , and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he , d artagnan , and his friend had rendered to the queen s party in the morning .: 44.91
<S> when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged , to which he made no opposition .: 43.86
<S> because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride .: 155.49
<S> thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais , and withdrew .: 46.21
<S> i am no longer astonished that you knew me not .: 20.52
<S> then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge , that trembled and shook before the tempest .: 65.33
<S> although a christian , may god forgive me , i have always sought to revenge my illustrious father .: 49.12
<S> have you so soon changed your mind , added morcerf , or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled ? danglars , seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it , the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage , turned to morcerf , and said : count , you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve , and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you ; but , believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me . these are all so many empty words , my dear sir , said morcerf : they might satisfy a new acquaintance , but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list ; and when a man like him comes to another , recalls to him his plighted word , and this man fails to redeem the pledge , he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing . danglars was a coward , but did not wish to appear so ; he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed .: 60.22
<S> a little better , sir . will you drink some of this ether and water ? i will try ; but don t touch me . why not ? because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return . drink . barrois took the glass , and , raising it to his purple lips , took about half of the liquid offered him .: 55.54
<S> oh , valentine , were i in your place , and did i feel conscious , as you do , of being worshipped , adored , with such a love as mine , a hundred times at least should i have passed my hand between these iron bars , and said , take this hand , dearest maximilian , and believe that , living or dead , i am yours yours only , and forever ! the poor girl made no reply , but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears .: 53.50
<S> the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth .: 55.65
<S> i think , rather than give pain to my dear mother , i would run the risk of offending the count . monte cristo turned away ; he seemed moved by this last remark .: 45.82
<S> oh , said dante s timidly , what is the matter ? villefort made no answer , but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds , and again perused the letter .: 21.80
<S> that pretty little soubrette whom d artagnan had already observed then came in .: 110.03
<S> tell me , now , if persistence is not a virtue ? my faith !: 40.54
<S> at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him .: 21.42
<S> sir , said he , here is monsieur d artagnan s answer . but i did not tell you there would be an answer , stupid ! said athos .: 15.04
<S> he drew from his breast the diamond cross and the star of the garter which she had sent him by those generous frenchmen ; he kissed it , and then , as he reflected , that she would never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the tomb , there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called forerunners of death .: 55.27
<S> d artagnan came to his relief with his whip in his hand .: 19.39
<S> it is almost dinner time , and i had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful stepmother , my too devoted maid , and my troublesome brother , who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery , which i am in a fair way never to get done .: 91.52
<S> the bracieux estate was a few leagues from villars cotterets .: 34.69
<S> at length they arrived at the cemetery .: 14.83
<S> scarcely had they entered , when she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor .: 42.90
<S> this was an easy feat to him , for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there , and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port .: 64.46
<S> and instantly , grimaud , sitting upon the board as if on horseback , commenced his perilous descent .: 74.89
<S> milady recognized his step .: 39.62
<S> but beneath the ground floor , stretching out into the island , was a large subterranean cavern , to which my mother , myself , and the women were conducted .: 45.72
<S> well now , he said , it seems , my dear friend , that something vexes you ; you are ill , perhaps ?: 20.61
<S> come , gentlemen , come . and albert , followed by franz and the count , descended the staircase , crossed the square chamber , where stood all the bandits , hat in hand .: 34.47
<S> have i not told you already that i had nothing to do with that ?: 17.26
<S> if so , depend on it , you will be happy . me ? said the young girl , he never even glances at me ; on the contrary , if i accidentally cross his path , he appears rather to avoid me .: 41.62
<S> the curtains were half drawn , and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries .: 119.45
<S> i have seen you , and invited you without any ceremony , when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept , as you were going to tre port . well , then , that is settled ; but you will come and call on my mother before tomorrow ? before tomorrow ? that will be a difficult matter to arrange , besides , i shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure . well , you can do better .: 37.76
<S> i should make an excellent gambler if i were not too hot headed ; but i was hot headed , just as if i had been drinking .: 42.66
<S> i only , as you see , have remained poor , wretched , and forgotten . you are mistaken , my friend , replied the abbe ; god may seem sometimes to forget for a time , while his justice reposes , but there always comes a moment when he remembers and behold a proof ! as he spoke , the abbe took the diamond from his pocket , and giving it to caderousse , said , here , my friend , take this diamond , it is yours . what , for me only ? cried caderousse , ah , sir , do not jest with me ! this diamond was to have been shared among his friends .: 40.84
<S> there d artagnan was asleep upon a bench .: 39.00
<S> as he stooped down to drink , he saw that his hair had become entirely white .: 47.86
<S> at that moment buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe , worked with gold , in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls .: 52.65
<S> did you hear , eternal sleeper ? cried d artagnan , irritated that any one could doze during the day , when he had the greatest difficulty in sleeping during the night .: 52.64
<S> i say two , because in such circumstances , monsieur du vallon , who is rich , always gives me his prisoners . mordaunt , completely deceived by the wordy civility of d artagnan , smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him , and said : i shall have the order signed directly , sir , and with it two thousand pistoles ; meanwhile , let me take these men away . no , replied d artagnan ; what signifies a delay of half an hour ?: 44.09
<S> d artagnan inquired of everyone he met with , went down to the ferry , came up again by the rue de seine , and the red cross ; but nothing , absolutely nothing !: 51.90
<S> let us separate , and let us seek the mercer s wife that is the key of the intrigue . a woman of such inferior condition !: 36.03
<S> if i should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey ? said athos .: 20.10
<S> in the first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half drunk ; and yet , in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or four bottles of burgundy carries with it to the brain , d artagnan , when awaking on the following morning , had all the words of athos as present to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth they had been so impressed upon his mind .: 47.66
<S> porthos was in bed , and was playing a game at lansquenet with mousqueton , to keep his hand in ; while a spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire , and on each side of a large chimneypiece , over two chafing dishes , were boiling two stewpans , from which exhaled a double odor of rabbit and fish stews , rejoicing to the smell .: 89.22
<S> bonacieux , since he has told you what he has suffered ; but to suffer for him is happiness . milady replied mechanically , yes , that is happiness . she was thinking of something else .: 42.99
<S> what , do you not know your house ? asked debray .: 15.36
<S> still , i must own i am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers it would have produced such an effect !: 68.09
<S> i threw the rest away with horror , and waited , with the dew of fear upon my brow .: 63.08
<S> i have let thee perish ! at this instant , in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the light of the moon the same whirlpool which had been made by the sinking men was again obvious , and first were seen , rising above the waves , a wisp of hair , then a pale face with open eyes , yet , nevertheless , the eyes of death ; then a body , which , after rising of itself even to the waist above the sea , turned gently on its back , according to the caprice of the waves , and floated .: 60.00
<S> it is when one is lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merry go round wheels and rewards us .: 157.66
<S> grimaud moved as if to leave the room .: 27.72
<S> heigho ! said porthos , opening his large eyes ; what have you got to say ? that his eminence has ordered you to england and that monsieur d artagnan is waiting for you in the stables . porthos sighed heavily , arose , took his hat , his pistols , and his cloak , and departed , casting a look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped to sleep so well .: 33.81
<S> the vendetta at what point shall i begin my story , your excellency ? asked bertuccio .: 33.48
<S> he causes a disturbance in your hostelry , which respectable people can not put up with .: 138.25
<S> selim , selim ! cried he , guardian of the fire , do your duty ! selim is dead , replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth , and you are lost , ali ! at the same moment an explosion was heard , and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atoms the troops were firing from underneath .: 46.95
<S> yet in spite of all this seduction milady might fail for felton was forewarned , and that against the least chance .: 80.84
<S> yet i think i hear her piano . it is mademoiselle louise d armilly , who is playing while mademoiselle danglars is in bed . well , said madame danglars , come and undress me . they entered the bedroom .: 43.79
<S> he took his way toward the ho tel of m. de tre ville ; his visit of the day before , it is to be remembered , had been very short and very little explicative .: 21.00
<S> you must mount your horse and proceed to the rue tiquetonne , hotel de la chevrette , whence you will take my horse and that of monsieur du vallon , which you must saddle and equip as if for war , and then you will leave paris , bringing them with you to cours la reine .: 45.57
<S> as they returned toward the castle , d artagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature , always dissatisfied with what it has , ever desirous of what it has not .: 74.92
<S> porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him to depart yet awhile .: 76.97
<S> it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind .: 36.21
<S> yes , said the paralytic with the same solemnity .: 14.20
<S> a great pity , said monte cristo .: 16.35
<S> suppose her majesty refuses ? oh ! said d artagnan , monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothing . here , monseigneur , said aramis , is the treaty proposed by the deputation of frondeurs .: 41.26
<S> besides , the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart .: 61.59
<S> stop , stop ! cried he , regaining strength by force of terror .: 45.49
<S> no ; my pride is to see the accused pale , agitated , and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence . rene e uttered a smothered exclamation .: 79.66
<S> my father died , but i did not die .: 17.35
<S> what do you think of our lover ? said he .: 13.19
<S> sir ! he thus addressed d artagnan , your resistance is useless ; these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron , oliver cromwell . these words struck d artagnan like a thunderbolt .: 69.21
<S> felton barred his passage .: 63.96
<S> in a few words , porthos and aramis were posted as to the situation .: 21.93
<S> you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals , but did you make them ?: 73.81
<S> when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentine s room .: 28.89
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> i could not have thought that there was an englishman in all england who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom i was speaking . the hand of the lord is stretched over him , said felton ; he will not escape the chastisement he deserves . felton only expressed , with regard to the duke , the feeling of execration which all the english had declared toward him whom the catholics themselves called the extortioner , the pillager , the debauchee , and whom the puritans styled simply satan .: 63.78
<S> m. de tre ville approved of the resolution he had adopted , and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear , he himself would undertake to find him , let him be where he might .: 35.55
<S> here it is , replied d artagnan , taking it from his finger .: 10.50
<S> now , you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast .: 56.60
<S> it struck ten .: 85.01
<S> these three others fenced against him with their agile swords .: 54.46
<S> alone in his usual room , lighted by two candles , the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness , just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of yore .: 96.63
<S> if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock .: 53.56
<S> then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force .: 157.04
<S> yes , replied d artagnan , from this very day ; and mind , if the wine is bad , we will send him to find better . we must use , and not abuse , said aramis , sententiously .: 35.48
<S> eight or ten days afterward aramis received the following letter : my dear cousin , here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of be thune , the air of which you think is bad for her .: 54.20
<S> you re welcome , sirs .: 83.18
<S> leave me alone , said aramis impatiently .: 26.05
<S> ideas do not become extinct , sire ; they slumber sometimes , but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely . ideas and men appeared the same to him , said albert .: 185.84
<S> after going about thirty paces , he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting , and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac ; they then led him on about fifty paces farther , evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow gaetano to go a refusal he could now comprehend .: 94.09
<S> i thought you were earning a living in tuscany or piedmont by acting as facchino or cicerone , and i pitied you sincerely , as i would a child of my own .: 70.97
<S> there is the wounded man , said de guiche , passing close to the augustine brother .: 33.64
<S> by eight o clock in the morning he was at the apartment of athos .: 11.99
<S> a glance at the walls of his salon proved to franz and albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures .: 35.07
<S> i have told him the truth ; that is to say , that the fault lay with my people , and that i was ready to offer you my excuses .: 25.23
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> still , though not actually received at the ho tel danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend , louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess .: 132.90
<S> bonacieux , mechanically , yes , let us be gone . milady made her a sign to sit down opposite , poured her a small glass of spanish wine , and helped her to the wing of a chicken .: 35.06
<S> one might think you really suspected us , monseigneur , and we were undergoing a real interrogatory .: 78.56
<S> you must go , then , mademoiselle , said emmanuel .: 15.85
<S> i approve of the deed , but i must pray for the dead . your son shall be happy , merce de s , repeated the count .: 26.36
<S> you must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the circumstances . d artagnan bowed with respect .: 34.05
<S> make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness , that my life or death are nothing to you .: 53.77
<S> but that act of self control , effective as it was , did not escape the eyes of the young princess .: 28.58
<S> he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy ; he looked at the pictures , whose faces seemed to smile , and the landscapes , which appeared painted in brighter colors .: 81.99
<S> anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival .: 68.17
<S> very well , said he .: 7.68
<S> are we not eating a horse , porthos ?: 42.66
<S> section 3 .: 18.45
<S> of what country are you ? asked the prince .: 11.14
<S> were you not already rich enough you who possess nearly a million ?: 86.78
<S> this man goes to give his last orders ; take the least thing , drink a finger of wine , and let us be gone . yes , said mme .: 35.75
<S> however , the revolution which appeared upon his countenance was so visible that bonacieux was terrified at it , and he endeavored to draw back a step or two ; but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut , the obstacle compelled him to keep his place .: 44.71
<S> the curate related the incident to the count of san felice , who sent for the little shepherd , made him read and write before him , ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics , and to give him two piastres a month .: 48.77
<S> now pass your arm through this opening . why ? you will know presently pass it . porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the opening .: 91.42
<S> but who then is andrea cavalcanti ? asked danglars in amazement .: 48.87
<S> the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose .: 30.20
<S> teresa was sixteen , and vampa seventeen .: 145.70
<S> he believed himself transported into that famous country of giants into which gulliver afterward went and was so frightened ; and yet he had not gained the goal , for there were still the landing place and the antechamber .: 104.41
<S> in the country people alter ; one gets to like , without knowing it , all those beautiful objects that god causes to spring from the earth , which are despised in cities .: 128.60
<S> a few minutes afterwards a flash of light , which was extinguished instantly , was seen on the land , and the sound of firearms reached the yacht .: 29.87
<S> it closed after him with a spring .: 51.08
<S> what do you want , sir ? said the king .: 5.52
<S> some one must go for help , said a lad , who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man , who was so large .: 50.85
<S> the general was there , surrounded by the more prominent chiefs .: 76.88
<S> the banker soon returned .: 50.93
<S> all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy , even the mild countenance of aramis .: 50.59
<S> because we want to know , said de guiche , haughtily .: 26.91
<S> what the devil , captain , one can not win all one s battles !: 41.63
<S> if i were a monk i should knock yonder and should have a good supper there , too ; whereas , tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds , dying with hunger and thirst . yes , added planchet , like the famous ass of buridan .: 103.73
<S> he was discovered ; all hope of flight was gone .: 69.00
<S> this time you will lay your plans more accurately ; we shall get out into the gallery you have described ; kill the sentinel who guards it , and make our escape .: 85.73
<S> i entreat of you not to go near him at least tonight ; and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great , pursue your researches if you will ; but tonight you neither can nor shall .: 145.22
<S> you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg works .: 23.92
<S> the prisoners sometimes , through mere uneasiness of life , and in order to be sentenced to death , commit acts of useless violence , and you might fall a victim . take all needful precautions , replied the inspector .: 78.02
<S> i never knew till now the delight of speed , said morcerf , and the last cloud disappeared from his brow ; but where the devil do you get such horses ?: 52.80
<S> felton made a slight bow , and directed his steps toward the door .: 16.64
<S> it may be judged whether d artagnan looked or listened with avidity .: 93.56
<S> yes , yes , war , said anne of austria .: 13.35
<S> a cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal .: 21.06
<S> stopped , terrified at what he was about to say , while richelieu , stretching out his neck , waited uselessly for the word which had died on the lips of the king .: 43.16
<S> full of hope , edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water , and , thanks to the vigor of his constitution , found himself well nigh recovered .: 45.92
<S> and for what kind of talent are they celebrated ?: 73.09
<S> porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger , in his turn , would drink the health of the king .: 32.90
<S> the duc de grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out .: 29.35
<S> in which we hear tidings of aramis .: 52.17
<S> you are examining the luxury i enjoy , said the queen , glancing sadly around her .: 32.10
<S> he calls himself so .: 59.18
<S> the house , with kitchens and cellars below , had above the ground floor , two stories and attics .: 67.54
<S> why , this very morning , in my rooms , he made his entre e amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement , not even excepting cha teau renaud . and what do you suppose is the count s age ? inquired merce de s , evidently attaching great importance to this question .: 63.08
<S> and who was he ? twas that low fellow , bonacieux . and porthos , enchanted at having relieved his mind , rejoined mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street .: 78.89
<S> is this young man an assassin by profession a murderer in cold blood ?: 138.27
<S> but we find it thus in the manuscript , and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it .: 41.84
<S> i can not believe it , murmured the banker .: 14.31
<S> the general proposed to cast lots for the swords , but the president said it was he who had given the provocation , and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms .: 53.64
<S> i will introduce you to them . but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent , said danglars .: 39.56
<S> besides , those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way toward the ho tel of m. de tre ville , who was waiting for them , already informed of this fresh disturbance .: 28.45
<S> what a proposition ! i thought , perhaps , said danglars with supreme impertinence , that you had a deficiency to make up ? indeed , said the receiver .: 36.70
<S> in a word , the island was inhabited , yet edmond felt himself alone , guided by the hand of god .: 38.35
<S> dante s employed it in man uvring his yacht round the island , studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service , till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities .: 109.99
<S> this immediately recalled to d artagnan s mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme .: 31.46
<S> will you eat any of these beans , cousin porthos ? said mme .: 52.18
<S> you see , monsieur , what the new world has to do with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe .: 32.03
<S> is it possible ? burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words .: 68.61
<S> free !: 40.15
<S> we are betrayed , said the king in a low voice .: 10.72
<S> the fortune is not her gift , but is inherited from my relations . certainly ; and that is why m. and madame de saint me ran have died ; that is why m. noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir ; that is why you , in your turn , are to die it is because your father would inherit your property , and your brother , his only son , succeed to his . edward ?: 54.48
<S> anne de bueil !: 30.77
<S> i regret that i ever crossed swords with you , porthos ; i swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast , but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment ; now , athos , come . athos was about to retire .: 62.66
<S> do not detain those gentlemen here , count , she said ; they would prefer , i should think , to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here , since they are not playing . ah , said a gallant old general , who , in 1809 , had sung partant pour la syrie , we will not go alone to the garden . then , said merce de s , i will lead the way . turning towards monte cristo , she added , count , will you oblige me with your arm ? the count almost staggered at these simple words ; then he fixed his eyes on merce de s .: 48.88
<S> he would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him .: 60.03
<S> these two instantly mounted , the coachman of the latter replacing d artagnan on the coach box of the royal coach .: 58.49
<S> you have already answered the question once , but so vaguely that i venture to put it a second time . really , said albert , i do not know ; when i invited him three months ago , he was then at rome , but since that time who knows where he may have gone ? and you think him capable of being exact ? demanded debray .: 44.04
<S> to cours la reine ! cried d artagnan to the coachman ; then turning to mazarin he said , now , my lord , you can say five paters and five aves , in thanks to heaven for your deliverance .: 46.97
<S> the noise increased ; steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer ; they were descending the steps leading to the cavern .: 69.12
<S> have you forgotten anything ? said aramis .: 13.62
<S> had any one but you been there , i don t say d artagnan bowed .: 54.96
<S> mousqueton ran thither , hearing the noise .: 70.02
<S> we shall know , sir , replied the president .: 12.13
<S> it seemed to him as though he were in a madhouse , and was becoming as mad as those he saw .: 36.64
<S> i understand what you say ! that is because we are talking spanish , my dear friend , said athos .: 21.26
<S> the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count s visage , or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders .: 60.23
<S> as to the key , it had disappeared .: 22.63
<S> anybody may possess a five franc piece . but do you suppose i carry five hundred francs about with me ?: 81.20
<S> you resist , do you ? cried jussac .: 48.70
<S> i say , why is the king taken prisoner ?: 68.46
<S> diavolo !: 35.10
<S> all this is very extraordinary , said cha teau renaud ; still , what i admire the most , i confess , is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are executed .: 35.94
<S> now , then , said the duke , and as he spoke , lowered the cane almost level with the ground ; pistache , my friend , jump for the illustrious coxcomb , mazarin de piscina . the dog turned his back to the cane .: 36.11
<S> then valentine s attention was engrossed by the clock in her room , which marked the seconds .: 42.27
<S> every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision ; but the man , instead of dissolving like a shadow , again approached her , and said in an agitated voice , now you may drink . valentine shuddered .: 58.91
<S> are you ambitious , and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth ?: 35.98
<S> these gentlemen , added he , pointing to the bodies , can not hear us . but we could throw them into the ditch , said porthos , after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets . yes , said athos , that s grimaud s business . well , then , cried d artagnan , pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the walls . heaven forfend ! said athos ; they may serve us . these bodies serve us ? said porthos .: 41.99
<S> the proofs were certainly not convincing , since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley slave on his death bed , and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion .: 101.90
<S> let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two musketeers , and return to athos .: 23.46
<S> by the way , i have received news of franz . have you ?: 43.89
<S> it is he ! cried d artagnan , pale with anger , and with the sweat on his brow , it is he !: 10.96
<S> instead of taking the waters of forges , i go and take sea waters ; i am free to do so .: 47.17
<S> jealousy gnawed his heart ; and he suffered almost as much as poor kitty , who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber .: 40.27
<S> well ? said the count .: 7.49
<S> monsieur the comte de la fere , he cried , i supplicate you !: 14.51
<S> an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me ; it is so rarely i make such a request , i am sure you can not grudge it to me . debray muttered something , bowed and went out , knocking himself against the edge of the door , like nathan in athalie .: 55.21
<S> and your excellency has one , which was let to prince lobanieff ; but i was obliged to pay a hundred that will do that will do , monsieur bertuccio ; spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements .: 106.69
<S> these were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the village .: 78.43
<S> a keeper ! reiterated the duke ; there was nothing wanting in my collection , except this gallows bird .: 81.27
<S> unfortunately , the negotiation failed , and when he returned to defend his benefactor , he was dead .: 33.77
<S> more than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp ; and in a separate group might be distinguished m. de busigny , the dragoon , the swiss , and the fourth bettor .: 45.48
<S> what refreshment can i offer ?: 84.86
<S> monsieur duke , i must have those letters ! sire , notwithstanding monsieur duke , at whatever price it may be , i will have them . i would , however , beg your majesty to observe do you , then , also join in betraying me , monsieur cardinal , by thus always opposing my will ?: 77.90
<S> bonacieux , and dwelt for an instant on the lips of d artagnan .: 16.65
<S> will you assure me it shall not be signed ? yes , said noirtier .: 18.98
<S> well , euge nie , what is it you want with me ?: 13.15
<S> let us go , you mean ? no , my friend , said athos , you must leave us . leave you ! cried d artagnan , quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement .: 13.24
<S> their spirits live in me .: 111.00
<S> at six o clock the curate of st. merri was announced .: 15.29
<S> when the two musketeers had entered ; when the door was closed behind them ; when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber , to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food , had recommenced ; when m. de tre ville had three or four times paced in silence , and with a frowning brow , the whole length of his cabinet , passing each time before porthos and aramis , who were as upright and silent as if on parade he stopped all at once full in front of them , and covering them from head to foot with an angry look , do you know what the king said to me , cried he , and that no longer ago than yesterday evening do you know , gentlemen ? no , replied the two musketeers , after a moment s silence , no , sir , we do not . but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us , added aramis , in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow .: 46.76
<S> let m. de rochefort enter , said mazarin , eagerly , on hearing their names pronounced ; and beg m. d artagnan to wait ; i shall have further need of him . these words gave great joy to d artagnan .: 40.93
<S> eight o clock found franz up and dressed , while albert , who had not the same motives for early rising , was still soundly asleep .: 88.73
<S> and yours ? i , said the traveller , am called sinbad the sailor . franz d e pinay started with surprise .: 40.06
<S> your majesty s mind may be quite at ease , replied the officer ; i have my answer ready . the blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the rue richelieu .: 36.86
<S> this last proof , instead of giving him fresh strength , deprived him of it ; the pickaxe descended , or rather fell ; he placed it on the ground , passed his hand over his brow , and remounted the stairs , alleging to himself , as an excuse , a desire to be assured that no one was watching him , but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint .: 35.91
<S> that proof satisfied him so completely that , as a sign of satisfaction , he has sent me , as your majesty may see , to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted . i listen to you , and i wonder at you , sir , said the queen .: 58.78
<S> really , honest men are not so scarce as i thought . don t be in a hurry to weave crowns for our scotchman .: 71.19
<S> can it be bad news ? i fear it . i will leave you with this stranger ; but as soon as he is gone , if you will permit me , i will return . permit you ?: 26.02
<S> there s what you want on that table , said the waiter .: 27.28
<S> each of these mobs was led by a chief , one of whom appeared to belong , not to the people , but to the honorable corporation of mendicants , and the other , notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people , might easily be discerned to be a gentleman .: 62.14
<S> the affair , as it will be reported , will cover us with shame ; for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound .: 121.70
<S> i am john francis de winter , he repeated , and that woman well , that woman ? was my mother ! the executioner uttered the first cry , that terrible cry which had been first heard .: 44.36
<S> at the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance .: 21.27
<S> let us try him . my friend , said he , slowly , i wish , as the son of an ancient friend for i consider this story of the lost letter perfectly true i wish , i say , in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in my reception of you , to discover to you the secrets of our policy .: 51.29
<S> yes , said he .: 5.77
<S> well , that tends to confirm my own ideas , said franz , that the countess s suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason .: 72.37
<S> yes , that is true as the gospel , said porthos ; i heard her with my own ears . i also , said aramis .: 25.61
<S> if the emperor remained on the throne , ge rard required a different alliance to aid his career ; if louis xviii .: 96.34
<S> you need not awaken the coachman ; ali will drive . in a very short time the noise of wheels was heard , and the carriage stopped at the door .: 27.77
<S> giovanni , light a torch , he added , and give it to his excellency . giovanni obeyed .: 46.85
<S> upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from tours , we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed , or rather went before , bazin ; he ran without stopping from the rue fe rou to the rue de vaugirard .: 42.51
<S> in the rue saint honore athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know , on horseback like himself , followed by a lackey like himself , and going in the same direction that he was .: 37.52
<S> admirable and dogmatic ! repeated the curate , who , about as strong as d artagnan with respect to latin , carefully watched the jesuit in order to keep step with him , and repeated his words like an echo .: 53.52
<S> was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning ? then i must die like a common criminal by the hand of the london executioner ? the london executioner has disappeared , your majesty , but a man has offered his services instead .: 72.77
<S> my dear friend , cried aramis .: 10.69
<S> what are you doing ? asked milady , with surprise .: 8.43
<S> the space was cleared , the two lamps placed on cromwell s desk , in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible ; and the swords crossed .: 46.55
<S> soldiers are big children ; but as i maintain that the orders of the king , and more particularly the orders of the cardinal , should be executed d artagnan could not restrain a smile .: 40.68
<S> they ask my name , i can not give it , since my parents abandoned me .: 30.64
<S> the plate was magnificent , old , and appertaining to the family .: 34.21
<S> they made him get out , walk along the banks of the river , and then brought him to teresa and luigi , who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st. sebastian . well , said the count , turning towards franz , it seems to me that this is a very likely story .: 18.69
<S> you have received a regular letter of advice ? yes , said danglars , but i confess i didn t quite comprehend its meaning . indeed ? and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you , in order to beg for an explanation . go on , monsieur .: 36.46
<S> you were saying , madame i came to ask you , my friend , said the baroness , what will be done with this impostor ? impostor , repeated villefort ; certainly , madame , you appear to extenuate some cases , and exaggerate others .: 41.06
<S> in his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree , that madame de chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her .: 50.94
<S> this reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure .: 32.02
<S> on their road they perceived lord winter marching at the head of his regiment .: 50.31
<S> the two guards led in athos .: 47.20
<S> the rencontre .: 51.72
<S> take some , she said .: 29.48
<S> you are right , said she , i have often thought of it . then she added in a low voice , and i will think of it again . felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones ; probably lord de winter perceived this emotion .: 20.08
<S> after numberless windings , dante s saw a door with an iron wicket .: 63.08
<S> the duc de longueville gained the government of pont de l arche , five hundred thousand francs for his wife and the honor of seeing her son held at the baptismal font by the young king and henrietta of england .: 42.26
<S> hold your tongue , said he , and let me answer .: 13.23
<S> i do not tell you this , madame , to terrify you ; no , it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you , and , believe me , i take no heed of such dreams .: 25.63
<S> let me overtake him ! he ?: 43.22
<S> valentine , said he , dear valentine , you must not speak thus rather let me die .: 35.07
<S> here s a sword and a dress , said porthos .: 22.06
<S> the prisoners are escaping !: 41.36
<S> deuce take it ! cried d artagnan , more moved than he had been for a long time , don t despair , my friend , if you have not received any letters from the count , we have received one . oh , really ! cried raoul .: 25.38
<S> a bed without curtains , four armchairs , and a couch , covered with yellow utrecht velvet , composed , with a prie dieu , all its furniture .: 76.61
<S> ah , ha , said albert , i see you were preparing for a game of cards . no , said the count , i was making a suit . how ? said albert .: 20.77
<S> the young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the chevalier d herblay ; two officers in the parisian forces rushed at that instant on raoul , but aramis protected him with his sword .: 46.30
<S> come , come , said andrea , sheathe your sword , my fine fellow ; there is no occasion to make such a fuss , since i give myself up ; and he held out his hands to be manacled .: 27.18
<S> spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him , which he was pressed to taste .: 83.90
<S> the brigands have never been really extirpated from the neighborhood of rome .: 45.91
<S> on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villefort s ; we say slowly , for morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps , but he had hastened to take leave of monte cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts .: 39.05
<S> providence has declared for us , since i have found this brave man again in so miraculous a manner .: 54.98
<S> milady s secret d artagnan left the ho tel instead of going up at once to kitty s chamber , as she endeavored to persuade him to do and that for two reasons : the first , because by this means he should escape reproaches , recriminations , and prayers ; the second , because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring , if possible , to fathom those of this woman .: 52.76
<S> the glass cutter had entered , and was feeling his way , his arms stretched out before him .: 74.14
<S> to what are you not equal , with your superior intelligence , infallible eye , your arm of iron and your enterprising mind ! now , said the gascon , that is all well , i accept for porthos and myself everything thanks and compliments ; we have plenty of time to spare . the two friends , recalled by d artagnan to what was also due to porthos , pressed his hand in their turn .: 62.87
<S> what might be the consequences ?: 41.47
<S> and yet he but desired the good of the people . yes , my lord , like yourself ! said the queen , ironically .: 33.23
<S> i faith , colonel , said d artagnan , we are very grateful for your gracious invitation ; for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner , as we have without breakfast .: 53.03
<S> tell me , i entreat . but my orders . your orders do not forbid your telling me what i must know in ten minutes , in half an hour , or an hour .: 37.91
<S> i see it and i thank you for it .: 20.19
<S> i wished to see all , and to judge of everything for myself , hoping the explanation would be in your father s favor , and that i might do him justice .: 33.90
<S> if i call , come , said he .: 17.95
<S> this letter !: 52.38
<S> the real reason , madame , i can assure you ; i know my father . but i want to know in what way m. d e pinay can have displeased your father more than any other person ? i believe i know m. franz d e pinay , said the count ; is he not the son of general de quesnel , who was created baron d e pinay by charles x. ? the same , said villefort .: 29.34
<S> well , morrel , let us both examine the depths of your heart .: 23.59
<S> 25th april , 149 well ! said faria , when the young man had finished reading it .: 50.20
<S> he saw then that he was with a poet .: 28.48
<S> no ; i must leave you at ten o clock . your engagement was for breakfast , then ? said the count .: 19.74
<S> at last they came in sight of a small wood , and spurring their horses afresh , rode in its direction .: 38.94
<S> then he came back to the point where , perhaps , he ought to have begun , and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned ; but this proved useless for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession , no one answered , and some of the neighbors , who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise , had assured him that that house , all the openings of which were tightly closed , had not been inhabited for six months .: 54.59
<S> emmanuel julie farewell ! how farewell ? exclaimed julie ; do you leave us thus , so suddenly , without any preparations for your journey , without even a passport ? needless delays but increase the grief of parting , said monte cristo , and maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything requisite ; at least , i advised him to do so . i have a passport , and my clothes are ready packed , said morrel in his tranquil but mournful manner .: 64.91
<S> take it ; buy some provisions ; be happy , and tomorrow we shall have more . gently , gently , said the old man , with a smile ; and by your leave i will use your purse moderately , for they would say , if they saw me buy too many things at a time , that i had been obliged to await your return , in order to be able to purchase them . do as you please ; but , first of all , pray have a servant , father .: 46.36
<S> the three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further , when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone , and a dozen balls came whistling around d artagnan and his companions .: 72.32
<S> but , since our resolution is formed , let us act promptly .: 51.60
<S> grimaud , finding that his master had been arrested , fell back into the ranks near aramis , without saying a word and as if nothing had happened .: 40.74
<S> in strafford s company , said mordaunt , tauntingly .: 57.62
<S> waiter , said danglars , pen , ink , and paper . pen , ink , and paper , muttered fernand .: 17.87
<S> what dreadful sufferings ! said julie , remembering valentine , but whom , with a delicacy natural to women , she did not name before her brother .: 80.70
<S> but i will take the left hand it is my custom in such circumstances .: 36.57
<S> yes , i am the executioner of lille , and this is my history . all eyes were fixed upon this man , whose words were listened to with anxious attention .: 30.37
<S> the following sunday , then , the parisians arose with joy ; at that period a te deum was a grand affair ; this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and it produced a great effect .: 50.95
<S> but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me . i do better than that , sir i save you . you do ?: 40.59
<S> you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined ; but the mazzolata still remains , which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time , and even the second , while the other , as you must know , is very simple .: 63.67
<S> madame de villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young edward , by way of amusing himself , was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading them .: 107.43
<S> jacopo , seeing him fall , had believed him killed , and rushing towards him raised him up , and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade .: 50.19
<S> let me have some dinner ! at once !: 54.50
<S> bonacieux , you speak that in a tone that frightens me ! mme .: 38.50
<S> besides , d artagnan has not told us his idea yet . and the musketeer , with his usual coolness , reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast .: 34.65
<S> what is this light ? asked he .: 10.07
<S> i did not do it intentionally , and not doing it intentionally , i said excuse me . it appears to me that this is quite enough .: 47.78
<S> will they not sign it ? no , said the paralytic .: 23.96
<S> by the way , this is merely a simple question , when this sort of people marry their sons , do they give them any fortune ? oh , that depends upon circumstances .: 68.58
<S> i shall tell him , therefore , and in doing so i shall confer a personal favor on him , how he is mistaken in regard to me .: 43.38
<S> if your friend remains another week in my cellar i shall be a ruined man . and not more than justice , either , you ass !: 77.45
<S> the colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion .: 133.24
<S> but notwithstanding the serene sky , the gracefully formed boats , and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed , the count of monte cristo , wrapped in his cloak , could think only of this terrible voyage , the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory .: 43.83
<S> what a question !: 17.97
<S> his arms became stiff , his legs lost their flexibility , and he was almost breathless .: 56.26
<S> i wish to inform you , my lord , replied groslow , with an irish accent , feigned of course , that if you are looking for captain rogers you will not find him .: 31.93
<S> i embrace you .: 37.86
<S> you would be no longer a lost child found , but you would be looked upon as an upstart , who had sprung up like a mushroom in the night .: 67.73
<S> monsieur , said the prince , turning toward raoul , i know that you have a letter from my sister , madame de longueville ; but i see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel . my lord , said raoul , coloring up , i did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the count .: 24.90
<S> hush ! cried la ramee , give me your gibbet , my lord .: 14.89
<S> no , monsieur le comte , answered the servant , i think not ; or at least he has not long been so , for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king , and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes .: 31.81
<S> monsieur bonacieux chapter xiv .: 42.24
<S> he looked around ; he was in a court surrounded by high walls ; he heard the measured tread of sentinels , and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine .: 47.34
<S> from the count , said bertuccio .: 26.75
<S> yes ; about in the same manner , said another musketeer , that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one . it s true , though , said porthos ; and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it . the wonder was increased , though the doubt continued to exist .: 61.84
<S> perhaps your love will make me forget all that i do not wish to remember . what do you mean , my lord ? i mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years of slow experience ; i have but you in the world , hayde e ; through you i again take hold on life , through you i shall suffer , through you rejoice . do you hear him , valentine ? exclaimed hayde e ; he says that through me he will suffer through me , who would yield my life for his . the count withdrew for a moment .: 49.14
<S> next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact , with the names of the victim and the murderer .: 59.83
<S> in spite of his habitual silence , the poor lad this time found his speech .: 47.07
<S> d artagnan and his two companions turned their backs , and commenced a retreat which resembled a flight .: 32.39
<S> let him come . yes , echoed porthos , glancing affectionately at his sword , still hanging on the wall ; we can wait for him ; let him come . moreover , he is but a child , said aramis .: 33.00
<S> and you , sir ? he said .: 6.14
<S> from day to day he lived on alone , and more and more solitary .: 54.81
<S> however much the ballet might have claimed his attention , franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it ; while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it , her eager , animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion , who , during the whole time the piece lasted , never even moved , not even when the furious , crashing din produced by the trumpets , cymbals , and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra .: 111.00
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> the king is either a king or no king ; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france , he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity ; and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief . unfortunately , madame , answered villefort , the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place . then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it . nay , madame , the law is frequently powerless to effect this ; all it can do is to avenge the wrong done . oh , m. de villefort , cried a beautiful young creature , daughter to the comte de salvieux , and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de saint me ran , do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles .: 79.67
<S> he felt that , influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition , teresa might escape him .: 95.91
<S> remain , then , where you are , and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue .: 36.40
<S> athos and d artagnan said nothing , but their silence seemed to imply consent .: 40.18
<S> a door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which mazarin sat .: 67.27
<S> it was that of a man , from five to eight and thirty , in the uniform of a general officer , wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion , that indicates superior rank , the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck , which showed he was a commander , and on the right breast , the star of a grand officer of the order of the saviour , and on the left that of the grand cross of charles iii. , which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain , or , what was just the same thing as regarded decorations , had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries .: 66.65
<S> at length one evening , as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night , dante s , with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall , fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones .: 45.01
<S> athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes , which they half opened when their companion came in again .: 56.13
<S> and king charles is well , as i have just heard ? he is dead , my lord ! said aramis .: 20.78
<S> you don t think of holding out against a whole regiment , do you ? said porthos .: 27.85
<S> take courage , vasiliki , said he ; today arrives the firman of the master , and my fate will be decided .: 58.76
<S> the marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing ; and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess .: 205.53
<S> he was eighteen , only three years older than you are , raoul , when i saw him set to work , pitted against tried men . and did monsieur d artagnan come off the conqueror ? asked the young man , with glistening eye .: 62.16
<S> villefort traversed the antechamber , cast a side glance at dante s , and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him , disappeared , saying , bring in the prisoner . rapid as had been villefort s glance , it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate .: 51.79
<S> the inspector listened attentively ; then , turning to the governor , observed , he will become religious he is already more gentle ; he is afraid , and retreated before the bayonets madmen are not afraid of anything ; i made some curious observations on this at charenton . then , turning to the prisoner , what is it you want ? said he .: 56.05
<S> up !: 167.54
<S> besides , the woman wore that black mantle which d artagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of the rue de la harpe ; still further , the man wore the uniform of a musketeer .: 31.76
<S> besides , the appearance of the caravan was formidable .: 29.63
<S> delightful !: 93.38
<S> i do not understand italian . yes , but you understand french , and mazarin laid his hand upon guitant s shoulder .: 36.93
<S> well , i wait patiently , do i not ? yes ; because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs , you expect five or six thousand , perhaps ten , perhaps even twelve , for you take care not to let anyone know the utmost .: 64.04
<S> in a few hours they were in the capital .: 18.39
<S> i can get you out of paris and leave you beyond the barriere , and can return for her . capital ; but how will you get me out of paris ? oh !: 34.35
<S> madame , answered the youth in his sweet voice , it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentleman that of the army .: 25.89
<S> what i have always wished for , desired , and coveted , is the life of an artist , free and independent , relying only on my own resources , and accountable only to myself .: 78.46
<S> madame , said d artagnan , rising , i have only one thing more to wish , which is , that the next thing you ask from me , shall be my life . and with this conclusion a way peculiar to himself he rose and left the room .: 31.32
<S> but , continued m. de tre ville , fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart , on account of my old companion , your father , as i have said , i will do something for you , young man .: 24.92
<S> further , this woman , as if not certain of the house she was seeking , lifted up her eyes to look around her , stopped , went backward , and then returned again .: 44.25
<S> he was in hunting costume covered with dust , wearing large boots , and holding a whip in his hand .: 32.41
<S> still more must be done .: 51.18
<S> look , gentlemen , all ! these words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth , that every eye was fixed on the count s forehead , and he himself passed his hand across it , as if he felt ali s blood still lingering there .: 52.47
<S> count , returned signor pastrini , hurt at albert s repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions , i do not say this to you , but to your companion , who knows rome , and knows , too , that these things are not to be laughed at . my dear fellow , said albert , turning to franz , here is an admirable adventure ; we will fill our carriage with pistols , blunderbusses , and double barrelled guns .: 45.98
<S> the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake , ready to cover our retreat ; they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps , and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others , in case of pursuit .: 48.75
<S> it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man , it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family ; it is not only a right , but a duty . you wrote , sir , knowing what answer you would receive . i , indeed ?: 48.18
<S> then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more .: 49.27
<S> oh , unfortunate creature !: 20.24
<S> nothing , she replied with a violent effort .: 30.01
<S> ah , if you laugh , if you doubt me , replied aramis , you shall know nothing . we believe like mohammedans , and are as mute as tombstones , said athos .: 35.79
<S> where is my son ? asked villefort ; let him be removed from the house , that he may not see master edward is not downstairs , sir , replied the valet .: 33.69
<S> monsieur du vallon , i commend his eminence to your care . be quite at ease , said porthos , holding out his hand , which d artagnan took and shook in his .: 29.31
<S> as she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure , i saw she would ere long become a mother .: 115.64
<S> an instant after , the broken door was removed , and the pale face of athos appeared , who with a rapid glance took a survey of the surroundings .: 36.98
<S> he should have been ? nothing , said the king , nothing .: 28.20
<S> all this looks suspicious . they said a quarter of an hour .: 43.23
<S> that is difficult , replied athos .: 13.87
<S> rely on me to procure you the other ; i will do my best . ah , m. morrel , exclaimed the young seaman , with tears in his eyes , and grasping the owner s hand , m .: 28.34
<S> besides , he is an englishman .: 14.11
<S> dead ! repeated a third voice .: 18.55
<S> but would it be just to allow me to go to a possible death without having given me at least something more than hope ? milady answered by a glance which said , is that all ? speak , then . and then accompanying the glance with explanatory words , that is but too just , said she , tenderly .: 60.01
<S> why , if you sought concealment , did you call your horse vampa ? that was an oversight , certainly , replied the count ; but tell me , does the count of morcerf never visit the opera ?: 49.30
<S> would not that dress please you ? what do you mean ? asked merce de s , with an angry glance , what do you mean ?: 17.76
<S> porthos had not only been well received by the company , but he was moreover looked on with great admiration .: 48.75
<S> you have conspired with your wife , with madame de chevreuse , and with my lord duke of buckingham . indeed , monseigneur , responded the mercer , i have heard her pronounce all those names . and on what occasion ? she said that the cardinal de richelieu had drawn the duke of buckingham to paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen . she said that ? cried the cardinal , with violence .: 33.37
<S> with the first dawn of day the jailer returned , with orders to leave dante s where he was .: 41.35
<S> the officer entered for the fourth time .: 27.96
<S> albert threw himself on the divan , tore off the cover of two or three of the papers , looked at the theatre announcements , made a face seeing they gave an opera , and not a ballet ; hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth powder of which he had heard , and threw down , one after the other , the three leading papers of paris , muttering , these papers become more and more stupid every day . a moment after , a carriage stopped before the door , and the servant announced m. lucien debray .: 82.32
<S> what subject of meditation could present itself to the banker , so fortunately become bankrupt ?: 197.12
<S> are you satisfied ? well , said felton , till tonight . and he darted out of the room , shut the door , and waited in the corridor , the soldier s half pike in his hand , and as if he had mounted guard in his place .: 22.04
<S> in that case , sir , rejoined madame de villefort , i will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes . she then bowed to m. noirtier and retired .: 30.77
<S> although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper , beauchamp as it sometimes , we may say often , happens was his intimate friend .: 204.82
<S> if an individual project gutenberg electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder , your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs 1.e.1 through 1.e.7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder .: 12.64
<S> when you have arrived there you will go to a mean tavern , without a name and without a sign a mere fisherman s hut .: 74.91
<S> if you know , why don t you tell ? she is under the big chestnut tree , replied the spoiled brat , as he gave , in spite of his mother s commands , live flies to the parrot , which seemed keenly to relish such fare .: 53.51
<S> villefort ran to her and seized her hand , which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper .: 53.49
<S> i confess i am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police , for , in italy , justice is only paid when silent in france she is paid only when she speaks .: 71.69
<S> the patron of la jeune ame lie proposed as a place of landing the island of monte cristo , which being completely deserted , and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers , seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen olympus by mercury , the god of merchants and robbers , classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct , but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category .: 83.13
<S> he started on seeing the cavalier with the curate .: 31.44
<S> i have weighed all the chances , calculated the time required for all the forms ; something must have happened . and then he walked rapidly to and fro , and pressed his burning forehead against the fence .: 73.09
<S> would god send the same dreams to you as to me if you did not love me ?: 53.67
<S> milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to kitty s in bringing it ; but at the first words she read she became livid .: 53.88
<S> he recalled , all at once , the warnings of lord de winter , the seductions of milady , her first attempts after her arrival .: 40.07
<S> well , monsieur la ramee , you shall judge of it yourself and at once . i can not , i replied ; it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the chateau . very well , said he , go and attend to your affairs , since you seem to be in a hurry , but come back in half an hour . in half an hour ? yes , have you breakfasted ? faith , no . well , here is a pate that will be ready for you , with a bottle of old burgundy . so , you see , my lord , since i am hungry , i would , with your highness s leave and la ramee bent low .: 27.83
<S> we shall meet again , shall we not , monsieur ? when you please , said d artagnan .: 15.00
<S> and then , continued mme .: 15.06
<S> i will be silent , then , said milady , casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice , with all the resignation she could impress upon her manner .: 37.10
<S> at the top of the stairs he found planchet in a great fright .: 20.22
<S> how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth ?: 56.62
<S> ah , ah !: 8.65
<S> i think not , replied cha teau renaud .: 9.06
<S> don t be afraid , said d artagnan .: 5.75
<S> should he find him at all ?: 39.25
<S> yes .: 18.24
<S> twenty minutes , twenty tedious minutes , passed thus , then ten more , and at last the clock struck the half hour .: 57.08
<S> in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other , an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentine s mind .: 25.78
<S> maximilian , in his devotedness , gazed silently at her .: 38.36
<S> no violence ; violence is the proof of weakness .: 80.49
<S> he had scarcely advanced three leagues out of rome when daylight began to disappear .: 68.04
<S> i called to you , but you did not answer me ; i wished to follow you , but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours .: 25.61
<S> don t condemn it from appearances ; you will find a horse in the stables quite as good as this . the same password ? exactly . adieu , master ! a good journey , gentlemen !: 63.68
<S> choose one of us to replace the comte de la fere . as long as i don t fight with him it is the same to me with whom i fight .: 30.88
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> but on taking this knife , felton , a terrible idea occurred to me .: 44.75
<S> ay , that smells good !: 82.63
<S> well , madame , it proved to be as we had supposed ; there was a mistake .: 33.44
<S> he did not speak , but showed the paper to dante s .: 18.02
<S> the next day was spent as usual .: 17.81
<S> see paragraph 1.c below .: 25.68
<S> mazarin turned the lock of a double door , on the threshold of which they found athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice comminges had given him .: 59.89
<S> then i feel as if i could adore madame de villefort . do not be in such a hurry to do that , said valentine , with a sad smile .: 20.67
<S> the night watch evinced the same terror , refused , in his turn , to accompany athos , and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to take .: 46.07
<S> very good , said groslow , and opened the door of the room .: 11.60
<S> well , excellency , said the landlord triumphantly , and without waiting for franz to question him , i feared yesterday , when i would not promise you anything , that you were too late there is not a single carriage to be had that is , for the three last days yes , returned franz , for the very three days it is most needed . what is the matter ? said albert , entering ; no carriage to be had ? just so , returned franz , you have guessed it . well , your eternal city is a nice sort of place . that is to say , excellency , replied pastrini , who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian world in the eyes of his guest , that there are no carriages to be had from sunday to tuesday evening , but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please . ah , that is something , said albert ; today is thursday , and who knows what may arrive between this and sunday ? ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive , replied franz , which will make it still more difficult . my friend , said morcerf , let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future . at least we can have a window ? where ? in the corso . ah , a window ! exclaimed signor pastrini , utterly impossible ; there was only one left on the fifth floor of the doria palace , and that has been let to a russian prince for twenty sequins a day . the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction .: 51.01
<S> yes , said the king , but i do not wish to be touched by any of those men . sire , i am here , said d artagnan , and i give you my word , that if a single man has the audacity , his life shall pay for it . and now what is to be done ? asked the queen , for i hear them . monsieur laporte , go to them and again recommend silence .: 23.59
<S> she belonged to one of the first families in italy , i think , did she not ? she was of a noble family of fiesole , count . and her name was do you desire to know her name ? oh , said monte cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me , for i already know it . the count knows everything , said the italian , bowing .: 30.61
<S> where does your highness wish to go ? to some elevated spot whence i can look down on lens and the surrounding country in that case , i m your man . i can trust you you are a true frenchman ? i am an old soldier of rocroy , my lord . here , said the prince , handing him a purse , here is for rocroy .: 57.28
<S> an instant after they were on the deck .: 15.33
<S> the terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man .: 63.34
<S> where are you taking me ? he asked .: 12.58
<S> i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes .: 54.94
<S> well , louis , said anne , why do you not kiss me ? i thought you were angry with me , madame ; you sent me away . i do not send you away , but you have had the small pox and i am afraid that sitting up late may tire you . you had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion . sire ! interposed laporte , in order to turn the subject , to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle ? to any one , laporte , the child said ; and then added in a loud voice , to any one except mancini . now mancini was a nephew of mazarin s and was as much hated by louis as the cardinal himself , although placed near his person by the minister .: 58.31
<S> my son , he said to him , you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here .: 33.19
<S> but what is the meaning of all these questions ? to tell you , my lord , that the moment has now arrived when , with a single word , you may recompense all these services . oh ! said oliver , with a slight curl of his lip , i forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid . sir , i can take my pay at this moment , to the full extent of my wishes . how is that ? i have the payment under my hand ; i almost possess it . what is it ?: 40.85
<S> it seems to me , said danglars , in his coarse tone , ill concealed by a forced smile , that you have already got horses enough . madame danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed , but , to the surprise of the young people , she pretended not to hear it , and said nothing .: 47.72
<S> the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms ; and seeing that sweet pale face , those lovely eyes closed , that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless , the idea occurred to him for the first time , that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father .: 63.85
<S> how few to day exist ! plague on t , my lord , have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me ? no ; i only brought you here to ask you , returned mazarin , smiling , if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers ? monsieur d artagnan ?: 48.01
<S> the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door , the two young people felt their hearts bound within them .: 47.35
<S> he whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow .: 83.26
<S> now , the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world , and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust ; yet , five minutes afterwards , the rabbit was dead .: 38.17
<S> that is our brave musketeer , i think , said the cardinal .: 21.17
<S> is that what you wish for ? asked she .: 13.34
<S> will you be ambassador , albert ?: 36.05
<S> about forty leagues only .: 75.58
<S> never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape , except in your dreams . and you are right , my dear la ramee , said the duke , wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow , wide awake though he was ; after this i will think of nothing but eating and drinking . hush ! said la ramee ; and one by one he sent away the guards , on various pretexts .: 57.40
<S> i eat everywhere , and of everything , only i eat but little ; and today , that you reproach me with my want of appetite , is my day of appetite , for i have not eaten since yesterday morning . what , cried all the guests , you have not eaten for four and twenty hours ? no , replied the count ; i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near ni mes , so that i was somewhat late , and therefore i did not choose to stop . and you ate in your carriage ? asked morcerf .: 40.92
<S> the belfry of st .: 32.77
<S> is it true , said the guard to the two cavaliers , that the duc de beaufort has arrived in paris ? nothing more certain ; and the best proof of it is , said d artagnan , that he has dispatched us to meet the duc de vendome , his father , who is coming in his turn . long live de beaufort ! cried the guards , and they drew back respectfully to let the two friends pass .: 26.80
<S> while working night and day , i sometimes lose all recollection of the past , and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel ; still , it is better than suffering . but , sir , he has fled ; let him escape inaction is a pardonable offence . i tell you it is too late ; early this morning the telegraph was employed , and at this very minute sir , said the valet de chambre , entering the room , a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior . villefort seized the letter , and hastily broke the seal .: 61.44
<S> this instant , sir this instant , i beseech you ! said the old lady .: 32.93
<S> she had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with coligny , who , for her sake , had been killed in a duel , in the place royale , by the duc de guise .: 44.17
<S> at length the hour drew near .: 20.72
<S> it is all in beginning .: 33.76
<S> you are a simpleton , said athos .: 11.55
<S> he looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimney piece ; they were a pen , ink , and paper .: 31.61
<S> he certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him , although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation , in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks , was very disagreeable to him .: 49.25
<S> the fifth of october volume one chapter 1 .: 25.95
<S> one of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court , and the other in the name of the people ; and then there won t be any parliament at all . and who is this colonel bridge ? asked aramis , and how does he go to work to weed the parliament ? colonel bridge , replied the spaniard , is a retired wagoner , a man of much sense , who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team , namely , that where there happened to be a stone on the road , it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it .: 62.07
<S> noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of valentine and himself an intervention which had saved them from despair .: 102.68
<S> you , who pretend to understand everything , even the hidden sources of knowledge , and who enact the part of a guardian angel upon earth , and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered to a young girl !: 76.69
<S> it had been d artagnan s practice , ever since the riots , to sleep in the same room as porthos , and on this eventful morning he was still there , sleeping , and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat , which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles .: 83.58
<S> well thought of , porthos ; this time you have an idea . undoubtedly , said porthos , drawing himself up at athos s compliment ; as there is a diamond , let us sell it . but , said d artagnan , it is the queen s diamond . the stronger reason why it should be sold , replied athos .: 29.53
<S> athos , on horseback , without his sword and kept in sight by comminges , followed the cardinal in silence .: 57.52
<S> behind her , but in deep shadow , was the outline of a masculine figure ; but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish .: 43.18
<S> you will deliver this letter to milady .: 29.80
<S> then taking a passport from his drawer he said , good , it is available for two months longer . chapter 105 .: 62.40
<S> upon my word , you did well to come back . nevertheless , replied the jeweller , if by the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated , i shall make another start . it s the mistral , said caderousse , and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning . he sighed heavily .: 41.72
<S> certes , cried athos , you are the best mounted poet of france or navarre . well , my dear aramis , you don t want three horses ?: 36.22
<S> you will conduct us yourself , then , to that door ? very willingly , if it be necessary to reassure you , answered the minister , and mazarin , who was delighted to get off so cheaply , led the way , in high spirits , to the corridor and opened the door .: 33.02
<S> there you must find the curate , or if he is not at home , go to the convent of the augustines , which is the last house on the right , and bring me one of the brothers .: 27.08
<S> toward six o clock d artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night .: 81.14
<S> one would think we had tipped the wink . what could i do ? said porthos .: 39.72
<S> since you now know my face , i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me .: 60.83
<S> have they offered you money ?: 66.64
<S> now let us lay down the plan of campaign , said porthos .: 24.98
<S> do you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual ?: 84.11
<S> seven o clock had just struck , and m. bertuccio , according to the command which had been given him , had two hours before left for auteuil , when a cab stopped at the door , and after depositing its occupant at the gate , immediately hurried away , as if ashamed of its employment .: 41.02
<S> all we have got to do is , to keep our own counsel , and remain perfectly quiet , not breathing a word to any living soul ; and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us . amen ! responded caderousse , waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars , and bending his steps towards the alle es de meilhan , moving his head to and fro , and muttering as he went , after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea .: 51.68
<S> on no pretense leave the door , for you know that last night my lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant , although i , during his absence , watched in his place . yes , i know it , said the soldier .: 45.23
<S> our friends ? are become our most dangerous enemies , athos .: 145.93
<S> monsieur d artagnan , repeated louis ; very well , madame . at this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were approaching .: 33.65
<S> yes , but listen : this was not all .: 35.64
<S> what is this ? said aramis to juxon .: 13.41
<S> in the first place , he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held ; and then he had the two hats to sell besides .: 52.67
<S> athos extended his arm toward him , pointing him out to his companions .: 30.76
<S> what is it ? the child conceals it . but where did he find it ? in his mother s laboratory . does his mother then , keep poisons in her laboratory ? how can i tell ?: 37.13
<S> he was not , however , a good sleeper .: 29.73
<S> come , you are accounted for , you are here , but where are your friends ? i do not know , my lord .: 20.12
<S> dead , dead ! the cold sweat sprang to the young man s brow , and his teeth chattered .: 13.88
<S> de chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men , which raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies , so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches , where the coadjutor was trying to reform his disorganized regiment .: 77.55
<S> i declare , my friend , said he , that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage .: 37.77
<S> at the noise felton made in entering , milady leaped lightly to the ground , and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand .: 50.48
<S> but i but i , cried olivain , pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore , how shall i cross ? leap , coward ! cried raoul , swimming on ; then addressing the traveler , who was struggling twenty yards in front of him : courage , sir ! said he , courage !: 70.11
<S> to be sure , to see you .: 21.71
<S> you must return to the rue des fossoyeurs ; i will accompany you . but however near it may be , replied d artagnan , i can not go thither in this guise . that s true , said athos , and he rang the bell .: 19.59
<S> for the rest this vengeance was very easy ; for milady , doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover , had ordered kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment , and even in the little chamber itself .: 47.69
<S> he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged , and then returned to the charge .: 50.61
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> but there are some with which , on the contrary , i am not acquainted .: 20.58
<S> everything with him was multiplication or subtraction .: 160.61
<S> i assure you , you are well known in the rue meslay . your family appears to be a very happy one , said the count , as if speaking to himself .: 26.58
<S> athos and aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality .: 56.94
<S> then i will go to the governor of algeria ; he has a royal heart , and is essentially a soldier ; i will tell him my gloomy story .: 40.42
<S> in a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring . these two men then went toward the compartment in which grimaud was secreted ; opened the door , entered and shut it after them .: 33.31
<S> so we will take leave of our friend , and let him hasten home . stop a moment , said monte cristo ; do not let me lose both my companions .: 27.95
<S> come , barrois , said the young girl , take some of this lemonade ; i see you are coveting a good draught of it . the fact is , mademoiselle , said barrois , i am dying with thirst , and since you are so kind as to offer it me , i can not say i should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it . take some , then , and come back immediately . barrois took away the waiter , and hardly was he outside the door , which in his haste he forgot to shut , than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which valentine had filled .: 48.36
<S> and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal , like a man who says , lord , thy will be done ! the cardinal approached the table , and without sitting down , wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two thirds were already filled , and affixed his seal .: 58.79
<S> the king looked around him .: 11.36
<S> at each shot morrel turned pale .: 63.50
<S> athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of anne of austria .: 38.43
<S> the count , with outstretched neck and glaring eyes , stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon morrel upon the first occasion .: 73.53
<S> is it about sending me to the bastile ?: 37.13
<S> in this apartment a continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night , while m. de tre ville , in his office contiguous to this antechamber , received visits , listened to complaints , gave his orders , and like the king in his balcony at the louvre , had only to place himself at the window to review both his men and arms .: 74.44
<S> i hope i shall gain rene e s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me .: 104.57
<S> the whole establishment had been changed ; another valet was engaged for himself , a new servant for noirtier , two women had entered madame de villefort s service , in fact , everywhere , to the concierge and coachmen , new faces were presented to the different masters of the house , thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family .: 63.59
<S> yes , said porthos , let us take the opposite direction ; if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger .: 30.74
<S> these animals , though wild and agile as chamois , were too much like domestic goats , and franz could not consider them as game .: 87.81
<S> gentlemen , said athos , who had assumed the command of the expedition , while grimaud spreads the table , let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges together .: 47.26
<S> so , replied de winter , laughing , that beautiful hair so skillfully disheveled , that white skin , and that languishing look , have not yet seduced you , you heart of stone ? no , my lord , replied the impassive young man ; your lordship may be assured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman to corrupt me . in that case , my brave lieutenant , let us leave milady to find out something else , and go to supper ; but be easy !: 56.47
<S> i think he is about to leave paris ; he was going to his banker . his banker ?: 29.28
<S> d avrigny took the young man s arm , and led him out of the room .: 11.09
<S> all is well , i thank you ; now leave us alone , mr. felton . chapter l. chat between brother and sister during the time which lord de winter took to shut the door , close a shutter , and draw a chair near to his sister in law s fauteuil , milady , anxiously thoughtful , plunged her glance into the depths of possibility , and discovered all the plan , of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen .: 60.23
<S> on the honor of gentlemen , said aramis and porthos .: 18.79
<S> my father looked at his watch , and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish .: 25.87
<S> on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start .: 81.89
<S> porthos , in spite of a touch of vanity , has many excellent qualities .: 48.75
<S> i will proclaim the violence you have used toward me .: 38.72
<S> seven o clock ! said grimaud , who had not spoken a word .: 14.54
<S> one believes readily what he wishes to believe .: 85.75
<S> the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation .: 8.83
<S> she had not long to wait ; directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her , and when she had passed through , it was again shut .: 40.47
<S> i do not know that . and did my husband know i had been carried off ? he was informed of it by a letter , written to him by the abductor himself . and does he suspect , said mme .: 33.52
<S> i have asked for no leave of absence . hold your tongue and take it ! said d artagnan .: 21.30
<S> it was in the time of the other cardinal , who was a great nobleman ; but our mazarin impossible !: 53.71
<S> he sighed and set to work again .: 40.81
<S> i have only one thing to ask of you ; that is , the name of your true executioner .: 25.29
<S> then , as it was cold , he asked for his gown , which was brought to him .: 19.84
<S> hullo , said albert ; it is monte cristo and his greek ! the strangers were , indeed , no other than the count and hayde e .: 55.88
<S> as to the horse , ride him a little every day , and that will accustom you to his maneuvers . oh , make yourself easy on that head , replied aramis .: 40.78
<S> when d artagnan returned to the palais royal at five o clock , it presented , in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town , a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing .: 24.92
<S> if i can get enough to rebuild artagnan , which my ancestors , impoverished by the crusades , allowed to fall into ruins , and to buy thirty acres of land about it , that is all i wish .: 93.89
<S> i believe , if she had not been laden , and i had been her master , he would have bought her .: 24.13
<S> here he is ! d artagnan , walking and soliloquizing , had arrived within a few steps of the ho tel d arguillon and in front of that ho tel perceived aramis , chatting gaily with three gentlemen ; but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m. de tre ville had been so angry in the morning , and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable , he pretended not to see him .: 34.24
<S> excuse my weakness !: 86.78
<S> it is not for nothing that i am styled louis the just , and he signed emery s appointment .: 65.71
<S> having reached the summit of a rock , he saw , a thousand feet beneath him , his companions , whom jacopo had rejoined , and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmond s skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish .: 73.42
<S> impostor , indeed ! m .: 59.41
<S> are you a doctor ? yes ; the best you could have at the present time , believe me . but you say you have watched ? said valentine uneasily ; where have you been ? i have not seen you . the count extended his hand towards the library .: 25.86
<S> the cell was clean , though empty , and dry , though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth .: 89.09
<S> with one of the clamps of my bedstead ; and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which i came hither , a distance of about fifty feet . fifty feet ! responded dante s , almost terrified .: 66.97
<S> believe soft spoken gentlemen again !: 922.28
<S> impossible , madame , impossible ! edmond , said the poor mother , who tried every means , when i call you edmond , why do you not call me merce de s ? merce de s ! repeated monte cristo ; merce de s !: 25.06
<S> both entered , and found themselves in darkness ; but mme .: 62.64
<S> the woman s hood was pulled down , and the man held a handkerchief to his face .: 28.40
<S> happily he did not meet anyone .: 54.60
<S> near the bottom of the ladder , when he found no more support for his feet , he clung with his hands ; at length , arrived at the last step , he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists , and touched the ground .: 39.21
<S> confound you and your punctuality ! said andrea , throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host .: 28.25
<S> you will see , replied monte cristo , that they will be as different as possible in the hands of ali .: 22.51
<S> she tried to be agreeable , and she was charming , winning the good superior by her varied conversation and by the graces of her whole personality .: 77.30
<S> and you are not afraid of that , athos ? no , replied athos , it is not the search of mazarin that i fear . now , said aramis , tell me a little what you do fear . nothing for the present ; at least , nothing in good earnest . and with regard to the past ? asked porthos .: 27.81
<S> then d artagnan ceased knocking , and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises , terror and cajolery , that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most fearful .: 70.05
<S> good heaven , said planchet , what a misfortune !: 27.59
<S> alas , speak to me more gently , father ; in my last moments i need a friend . do you suffer much ? asked the monk .: 47.53
<S> it was only poisoned to the abbe adelmonte .: 38.26
<S> do you permit me to return ? yes , to morrow . the cardinal took the queen s hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips .: 16.18
<S> no , sir , replied anne of austria , and you may retire until the time that i mentioned to you . d artagnan bowed and went out .: 13.77
<S> nothing , said milady , smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her smile .: 36.97
<S> after quitting anne , mazarin took the road to rueil , where he usually resided ; in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself .: 142.11
<S> a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal , who did not shudder readily .: 35.65
<S> mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence , the play of which had been , nevertheless , subdued by age and experience ; and d artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look , very different , indeed , from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant .: 103.60
<S> i am , indeed , to be pitied .: 16.76
<S> another had done all this ; why , then , was it impossible to dante s ?: 35.33
<S> that will do , said milady ; go into your own room , and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter i gave you . for monsieur de wardes ? said kitty .: 37.64
<S> are there , then , in england two men to whom such an epithet can be applied ? you mean george villiers ? asked felton , whose looks became excited .: 83.90
<S> what you ask is impossible , monsieur , continued he , addressing faria .: 35.13
<S> compared with such things , what is the letter you have just read ? a lover s deception , which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive ; but not so the lover who was to have married her .: 62.94
<S> well , said cucumetto , have you executed your commission ? yes , captain , returned carlini .: 24.83
<S> never did a gamester , whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die , experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope .: 132.02
<S> four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger , which , no doubt , in acknowledgement of the compliment , lowered her own shallop into the sea , and the five boats worked so well that by two o clock in the morning all the cargo was out of la jeune ame lie and on terra firma .: 62.77
<S> villefort left her to the care of the women , while old barrois ran , half scared , to his master ; for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person .: 98.05
<S> and you ? hang it ! said porthos , a little perplexed between the two , i suppose , as i came with you , i must go away with you .: 30.41
<S> and we have just heard , continued albert , of a new deed of his , and so heroic a one , that , although i have seen him today for the first time , i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend . at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look , changing color , and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion .: 55.50
<S> why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles worth !: 45.16
<S> something was at work on the other side of the wall ; the prisoner had discovered the danger , and had substituted a lever for a chisel .: 42.49
<S> did you see poor barrois die ? noirtier raised his eyes to heaven .: 27.30
<S> he was then only fifteen feet from the ground , as the gentlemen below had told him .: 59.50
<S> as we have already said , milady was admirably acquainted with this part of france .: 28.30
<S> three of the four horses had already arrived .: 23.14
<S> why , having recognized you , and i the only one to do so why was i able to save my son alone ?: 46.96
<S> what do you want me for , sir ? demanded he of the paralytic .: 16.60
<S> since his majesty still lives , since the honor of the throne is safe , everything else is a matter of indifference to me . athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart .: 31.69
<S> an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms .: 117.98
<S> athos is going to examine the castle , which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege ; porthos will see to the provisions and aramis to the troops of the garrison .: 61.66
<S> although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked .: 42.48
<S> have pity on me , then , and ask for me , not intelligence , but a trial ; not pardon , but a verdict a trial , sir , i ask only for a trial ; that , surely , can not be denied to one who is accused ! we shall see , said the inspector ; then , turning to the governor , on my word , the poor devil touches me .: 43.10
<S> her very self ; she gave it me last night .: 111.25
<S> what does the executioner ?: 34.66
<S> her face , as she looked at athos , had taken on an expression that can not be described .: 53.83
<S> he knew that it was barren and without shelter ; but when the sea became more calm , he resolved to plunge into its waves again , and swim to lemaire , equally arid , but larger , and consequently better adapted for concealment .: 86.03
<S> suddenly vampa turned toward his mistress : ah , said he good , good !: 81.30
<S> he had tried his strength to the utmost .: 30.33
<S> my worthy cocles , said morrel in a tone impossible to describe , do you remain in the antechamber .: 43.35
<S> i may say with lucullus , if i could have anticipated the honor of your visit , i would have prepared for it .: 26.12
<S> this strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the alle es de meilhan , and a multitude of theories were afloat , none of which was anywhere near the truth .: 69.69
<S> tis he , past all doubt . what do you say ? nothing , nothing .: 48.08
<S> you are a christian ; you are my sister in religion .: 23.85
<S> but , asked the visitor , do you know why he came to france ? he is speculating in railways , said lord wilmore , and as he is an expert chemist and physicist , he has invented a new system of telegraphy , which he is seeking to bring to perfection . how much does he spend yearly ? asked the prefect .: 46.78
<S> but it is probable , said the light horseman , that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bastion . yes , that s probable , said d artagnan .: 26.58
<S> a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us , or with a more perfect courtesy . come , observed the countess , smiling , i see my vampire is only some millionaire , who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m. de rothschild ; and you have seen her ? her ? 20183m the beautiful greek of yesterday . no ; we heard , i think , the sound of her guzla , but she remained perfectly invisible . when you say invisible , interrupted albert , it is only to keep up the mystery ; for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains ? where was this window with white hangings ? asked the countess .: 51.87
<S> where is the prisoner ? said a voice .: 12.53
<S> at this last thought merce de s burst into a flood of tears , and wrung her hands in agony ; but the thought , which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another , came now in full force upon her mind ; and then , too , old dante s incessantly said to her , our edmond is dead ; if he were not , he would return to us . the old man died , as i have told you ; had he lived , merce de s , perchance , had not become the wife of another , for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity .: 45.87
<S> porthos , who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides , was very cross and questioned d artagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game .: 50.50
<S> it is m. maximilian morrel , said she ; the son of that good merchant of marseilles , whom you doubtless recollect . yes , said the old man .: 27.35
<S> he approached the duke , took his hand , held it for an instant in his own , and letting it fall , all is useless , said he , he is dead . dead , dead ! cried patrick .: 25.03
<S> every pulse beat with feverish excitement , every nerve was strained , every vein swollen , and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest , thus multiplying his agony a thousand fold .: 90.43
<S> you , to be sure ! said d artagnan , pressing athos s hand .: 12.10
<S> my dear sir , said cha teau renaud , allow me to tell you that you do not understand that man uvre with the eye glass half so well as debray .: 29.72
<S> then turning to aramis : aramis , he said , break your sword . aramis hesitated .: 29.06
<S> now , madame , i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday ; it is not long ago , you see , and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts .: 45.84
<S> it was round , and a large divan completely encircled it .: 51.25
<S> but in france they are considered in very bad taste ; there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs , judges who condemn , and scaffolds which avenge . bertuccio clasped his hands , and as , in all these evolutions , he did not let fall the lantern , the light showed his pale and altered countenance .: 78.02
<S> by a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and raoul began to write .: 94.57
<S> speak on , said aramis .: 14.75
<S> horticulture seemed , however , to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen garden ; and where cabbages , carrots , radishes , peas , and melons had once flourished , a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation .: 153.42
<S> pray , signor pastrini , asked franz , is not some execution appointed to take place today ? yes , your excellency ; but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from , you are much too late . oh , no , answered franz , i had no such intention ; and even if i had felt a wish to witness the spectacle , i might have done so from monte pincio ; could i not ? ah ! exclaimed mine host , i did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill , which , indeed , they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves . very possibly i may not go , answered franz ; but in case i feel disposed , give me some particulars of today s executions . what particulars would your excellency like to hear ? why , the number of persons condemned to suffer , their names , and description of the death they are to die . that happens just lucky , your excellency !: 68.37
<S> eight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer , and escaped .: 42.88
<S> well , said beauchamp , here is my answer , my dear sir .: 9.74
<S> m. de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinal s fat face .: 43.40
<S> oh , father ! said she , clasping her hands , forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings . morrel again changed color .: 53.08
<S> alas , do you love nothing else in me ? asked d artagnan .: 15.85
<S> i had only to cry out help ! for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces , and then i should have been free . why didn t you do it ? asked the lieutenant .: 38.86
<S> go and bring me back the cardinal as soon as possible . madame , faltered d artagnan , tis twenty years ago i have a good memory since i had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the hotel de ville , of kissing one of those lovely hands . there is the other , replied the queen ; and that the left hand should not be less liberal than the right , she drew from her finger a diamond similar to the one formerly given to him , take and keep this ring in remembrance of me .: 42.71
<S> yes , yes , very sure ! perhaps you did not see well . oh , if i were to see the plume of his hat , the end of his cloak , i should know him ! milady was dressing herself all the time .: 48.29
<S> a youthful indiscretion , i suppose , which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large ? the major recovered himself , and resumed his usual calm manner , at the same time casting his eyes down , either to give himself time to compose his countenance , or to assist his imagination , all the while giving an under look at the count , the protracted smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity .: 71.97
<S> well , undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect and fear of kings ; teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant ; and repeat often and loudly , so that all may know it , that the misfortunes of france are caused by mazarin , her lover and her destroyer ; begin this work to day , this instant even , and in three days i shall expect the result .: 81.98
<S> in an instant they found themselves in a little harbor , formed in a natural creek ; the boat grounded on the fine sand .: 39.65
<S> they had formed a circle round the invalid ; the second notary was sitting at a table , prepared for writing , and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have alluded .: 43.43
<S> what do you think of monsieur de tre ville telling me , when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday , that you associated with the suspected english , whom the cardinal protects ? that is to say , i visit an englishwoman the one i named . oh , ay !: 39.63
<S> sermons ?: 511.96
<S> my lord who told you that ? nobody , but i know it . i regret infinitely to tell you , my lord , that you are mistaken , replied the gascon , impudently , firm to the promise he had just made to anne of austria .: 31.34
<S> yes , but i came to ask something more than to be your companion . and what may that be ? inquired the bandits with astonishment .: 26.56
<S> the minute hand moved on .: 123.41
<S> but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave ? how was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster ?: 67.66
<S> or , take care , morrel , lest i call you ungrateful . have pity on me , count ! i feel so much pity towards you , maximilian , that listen to me attentively if i do not cure you in a month , to the day , to the very hour , mark my words , morrel , i will place loaded pistols before you , and a cup of the deadliest italian poison a poison more sure and prompt than that which has killed valentine . will you promise me ? yes ; for i am a man , and have suffered like yourself , and also contemplated suicide ; indeed , often since misfortune has left me i have longed for the delights of an eternal sleep . but you are sure you will promise me this ? said morrel , intoxicated .: 63.90
<S> it was only a momentary glance , but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century , so much was expressed in that one look .: 40.39
<S> d artagnan , who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point , was not at more than three paces from it .: 37.04
<S> oh , yes ; i will listen , monsieur , for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give .: 32.61
<S> the next morning , at nine o clock , he entered franz s room , followed by a tailor , who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm ; they selected two exactly alike , and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon , and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fe te days .: 66.12
<S> hear me , said he ; this man has gone , and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance ; but let us be united , as we were to have been , and then leave it to lord de winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife . lord de winter ! cried felton .: 32.18
<S> he knows how , as you must have observed , to obey an order for you did not , i am sure , come from portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak .: 49.27
<S> oliver cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as mazarin s than to a queen admirable for firmness , without doubt , but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right .: 150.07
<S> well , the abbe the abbe busoni . monte cristo took off the wig which disfigured him , and let fall his black hair , which added so much to the beauty of his pallid features .: 32.01
<S> the company of m. le chevalier dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted d artagnan .: 111.14
<S> thanks , my lord , i will speak to him myself .: 13.49
<S> the wounds that i make are better than that witness the executioner of bethune , my uncle and king charles .: 78.25
<S> let him find it out if he can !: 53.43
<S> yes , sir , replied the abbe ; and you are the person whom m. de boville , formerly an inspector of prisons , sends to me from the prefect of police ? exactly , sir . one of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris ? yes , sir replied the stranger with a slight hesitation , and blushing .: 36.24
<S> although she had eaten nothing in the morning , the dinner was brought in at its usual time .: 47.48
<S> it was , then , richelieu s object , not only to get rid of an enemy of france , but to avenge himself on a rival ; but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand , as his weapon for combat , the forces of a kingdom .: 52.22
<S> stop a minute , answered caderousse ; we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story , which would be a pity ; and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves . with these words he went stealthily to the door , which he closed , and , by way of still greater precaution , bolted and barred it , as he was accustomed to do at night .: 45.19
<S> first , m. and madame de saint me ran incurred his displeasure , so he poured out three drops of his elixir three drops were sufficient ; then followed barrois , the old servant of m. noirtier , who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch he therefore received the same quantity of the elixir ; the same happened to valentine , of whom he was jealous ; he gave her the same dose as the others , and all was over for her as well as the rest . why , what nonsense are you telling us ? said cha teau renaud .: 60.94
<S> it was , indeed , strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in paris .: 38.39
<S> the young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience , turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again , rummaging and rerummaging in his valise , and opening and reopening his purse ; but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found , he flew , for the third time , into such a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine , oil , and rosemary for upon seeing this hot headed youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found , the host seized a spit , his wife a broom handle , and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before .: 86.43
<S> then d artagnan , being alone , struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder , mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers .: 27.99
<S> i shot two with my double barrelled gun , and two more with my pistols , but i was then disarmed , and two were still left ; one seized me by the hair that is why i now wear it so short , for no one knows what may happen , the other swung a yataghan , and i already felt the cold steel on my neck , when this gentleman whom you see here charged them , shot the one who held me by the hair , and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre .: 74.53
<S> nevertheless , you have not been forgotten in our plans , and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentine s future husband will consent , not to live in this house , for that might not be pleasant for the young people , but that you should live with them ; so that you and valentine , who are so attached to each other , would not be separated , and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done , and thus , instead of losing , you will be a gainer by the change , as it will secure to you two children instead of one , to watch over and comfort you . 30165m noirtier s look was furious ; it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old man s mind , for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat , and not being able to find vent in utterance , appeared almost to choke him , for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle .: 56.34
<S> they carried him through an alley , up a flight of stairs , and deposited him in an antechamber .: 44.79
<S> he entered , and on his way met the waiter .: 24.77
<S> the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits the bright , pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged , illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness , as , immediately after villefort s departure , his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him , of tasting , at least , a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind .: 98.42
<S> lay him down here ; we ll gag him and tie him no matter where somewhere .: 270.72
<S> his relations with the former court , of which he always spoke with dignity and respect , made him respected by the new one , and he knew so many things , that not only was he always carefully considered , but sometimes consulted .: 63.26
<S> black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues ; the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments ; then follows the melancholy chant of the priests , mingled now and then with a sob of anguish , escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers .: 121.72
<S> so now , you are both forewarned . the young men bowed , and quitted the box .: 30.95
<S> i know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings ; but after all , as i have given you proofs , my dear cousin , i am not unskilled in such affairs , and i will take charge of the commission .: 47.35
<S> barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness .: 120.08
<S> it was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man s favor .: 26.03
<S> monseigneur will be with him in an hour . good ! said friquet , my fortune is made . by the way , said bazin , where was he carried ? to the tower saint jacques la boucherie ; and delighted with the success of his embassy , friquet started off at the top of his speed .: 43.53
<S> you can understand , can you not , that to have acted as i have done , to have broken that glass , to have intruded on the solitude of a friend you can understand that , to have done all this , i must have been actuated by real uneasiness , or rather by a terrible conviction .: 40.57
<S> then it was the will of god that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful , continued grimaud .: 59.38
<S> there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths , or a weed in the flower beds ; no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums , her cacti , and her rhododendrons , in her porcelain jardinie re with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure .: 113.22
<S> at the same time couriers started in every direction over england and europe to announce that charles stuart was the prisoner of oliver cromwell .: 63.19
<S> himself .: 100.94
<S> oh , let us have no gestures , no screams , no modern drama , or you will oblige me to tell you that i see debray leave here , pocketing the whole of the 500,000 livres you have handed over to him this year , while he smiles to himself , saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discovered that is , a roulette where he wins without playing , and is no loser when he loses . the baroness became enraged .: 104.91
<S> but , for heaven s sake resumed aramis .: 27.76
<S> the chaplain of the cha teau came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence , in order to take a trip to hye res for a week .: 45.09
<S> revenge yourself , then , edmond , cried the poor mother ; but let your vengeance fall on the culprits , on him , on me , but not on my son ! it is written in the good book , said monte cristo , that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation .: 51.17
<S> mount , my lord , said d artagnan to mazarin , who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second bidding .: 20.79
<S> look , look , doctor , said villefort , he is quite coming round again ; i really do not think , after all , it is anything of consequence . m. d avrigny answered by a melancholy smile .: 39.33
<S> the woman must have once been handsome , but traces of sorrow have aged her .: 83.61
<S> athos set the lackeys to work first because , since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities .: 70.85
<S> alas , anything you please .: 85.16
<S> i am older than your eminence , although i possess not your wisdom .: 42.20
<S> yes , said madame de villefort , the door was towards the road before , and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road , i remember . yes , madame , said monte cristo ; but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate . in four days , said morrel ; it is extraordinary ! indeed , said cha teau renaud , it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one ; for it was very old , and dull too .: 37.75
<S> franz , however , did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent .: 50.24
<S> go upstairs , she said to the doctor .: 21.79
<S> but besides these eight men , you doubtless place some guard outside ? oh , no !: 133.13
<S> i looked carefully around ; i was indeed alone , no noise disturbed the silence but the owl , whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night .: 72.18
<S> sure of being killed by athos , it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about porthos .: 42.56
<S> there remained three leagues to travel , and they did it amid torrents of rain .: 68.69
<S> greece only had risen against turkey , and had begun her war of independence ; all eyes were turned towards athens it was the fashion to pity and support the greeks .: 145.79
<S> the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase ; it was evident that every precaution had been taken .: 49.24
<S> it is true , the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial , and dante s repeated it to himself , from one end to the other , for he had not forgotten a word .: 27.47
<S> you must have much reason to complain of him . not very much , said d artagnan .: 16.95
<S> for i think you told me it was a boy , m. bertuccio . no excellency , i do not recollect telling you that . i thought you did ; i must have been mistaken . no , you were not , for it was in reality a little boy .: 38.92
<S> arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed , turned around , and looking insolently at the frenchmen , passed some jests from one to another .: 49.74
<S> exordium , repeated the curate , for the sake of saying something .: 33.38
<S> what i do care for now , is to make my way into the jesuits convent ; so to horse and let us knock at their door .: 77.70
<S> monsieur du vallon , yonder , is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly , so he does not care about money .: 48.89
<S> it is there you are to take up your quarters . then , in these trunks i presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to need , your plain clothes and your uniform .: 60.67
<S> edmond , if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i thought you were living and since i have thought you must be dead !: 46.29
<S> in a short time the two unfortunate beasts , who had not eaten anything since the morning , made such a noise in raising and letting fall the knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged .: 75.70
<S> now , continued villefort , those to whom the guilt really belongs , by whom the crime was committed , on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here , and the certain judgment of god hereafter , would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed . noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame .: 128.66
<S> yes , yes ; but now what did i do with that letter ? d artagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes .: 26.30
<S> pardon me for quitting you , my dear madame bonacieux , said he ; but , not knowing you would come to see me , i had made an engagement with a friend .: 23.85
<S> the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person , attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial than mere fascination .: 106.04
<S> you are only betrayed . the king sighed deeply .: 27.09
<S> pardon me , sir , replied the valet ; you had forbidden me to disturb you , but the count of morcerf has called me . well ! said albert .: 18.69
<S> for was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention to destroy that son of whom m. de morcerf was so proud ?: 73.63
<S> diable ! said morcerf .: 24.02
<S> any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg license as specified in paragraph 1.e.1 .: 12.40
<S> be satisfied , said d artagnan , laughing , porthos will pay you with the money of the duchess coquenard . oh , monsieur , procurator s wife or duchess , if she will but loosen her pursestrings , it will be all the same ; but she positively answered that she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of monsieur porthos , and that she would not send him a denier . and did you convey this answer to your guest ? we took good care not to do that ; he would have found in what fashion we had executed his commission . so that he still expects his money ? oh , lord , yes , monsieur !: 48.86
<S> there was , indeed , reason to retreat , to be alarmed , and to scream .: 33.84
<S> so you have seen the arm , that was all .: 28.13
<S> the truth was , that luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial , and , half by persuasion and half by force , he had removed teresa toward another part of the garden .: 58.22
<S> he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery with m. de villefort .: 41.02
<S> 4 beheaded .: 198.04
<S> all those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred . it was , then , with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet , who alone could give them information , was alive or dead , that the friends returned to the place royale ; to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there , drinking and bantering each other , although , doubtless , mourned by their families , who thought they were at charenton in the thickest of the fighting .: 72.69
<S> you are in a hurry ? said the musketeer , as pale as a sheet .: 12.63
<S> please , sir , said the boy , do you think i can gain any more half pistoles in any way ? perhaps , replied d artagnan .: 17.39
<S> every door was opened to him .: 18.48
<S> it would not be long before i should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in france than the cardinal mazarin ! at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile ; and had they not known it for a fact , this would have told them that de chatillon and de flamarens had been there .: 82.78
<S> her majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor . and that in the presence of witnesses !: 50.27
<S> promise me that , and i will die with that hope . i will say , continued the count , that he followed and watched you the whole time , and when he saw you leave the house , ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself . did you see all that ? remember my words : if you return home safely , i shall believe god has forgiven you , and i will forgive you also . and you did not warn me ! cried caderousse , raising himself on his elbows .: 33.71
<S> albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up .: 76.90
<S> it is twelve o clock , maximilian ; thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the evening , or tomorrow morning .: 44.32
<S> we say corroborated , because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof .: 58.86
<S> he entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes , his left hand on the pommel of the sword , and cracking his whip with his right hand .: 26.35
<S> she suited me in every respect , and i would have married her . and he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after madame danglars departure before he left the house .: 47.58
<S> wait a week and i myself will give you some . a week is too long .: 59.98
<S> au revoir , then ; that is all i have to say today .: 26.59
<S> let one of us put on the dress and mount the king s horse .: 48.24
<S> the carriage had started , madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man , and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction .: 21.06
<S> count de guiche , said the prince , it is a long time since you saw your father , remain here with him .: 22.46
<S> make way for us , planchet , said d artagnan in a whisper to him , or he will not arrive alive ; the lungs are attacked , my friend . planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says , in that case things look ill. then he exclaimed , turning to his men : let them pass ; they are friends . the carriage resumed its course , and mazarin , who had held his breath , ventured to breathe again .: 40.28
<S> on my word , i almost regret that in all probability this miserable peppino will not be beheaded , as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts , and whether it is worth even mentioning ; but , really this is a most singular conversation for the carnival , gentlemen ; how did it arise ?: 87.29
<S> there is a way of detecting its presence .: 36.07
<S> oh , cried she , without losing any of her cheerfulness , this is singular !: 29.91
<S> tell me , tell me , tell me , i say , repeated milady , how do you know it ? how do i know it ? said d artagnan .: 10.16
<S> oh , spare me ! that the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same . m. de villefort started from his seat , then in a moment fell down again , silent and motionless .: 48.83
<S> in three seconds d artagnan had wounded him three times , exclaiming at each thrust , one for athos , one for porthos ; and one for aramis ! at the third hit the gentleman fell like a log .: 68.84
<S> aramis continued , and yet , while i do belong to the earth , i wish to speak of you of our friends . and on my part , said d artagnan , i wished to speak of you , but i find you so completely detached from everything !: 36.16
<S> the young man was thrown from the top of the rock ; the corpse was found on the bed next day , and the whole truth was guessed , for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before , that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep , they heard a shriek , which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared . the count breathed with difficulty ; the cold drops ran down his forehead , and his heart was full of anguish .: 39.98
<S> with a word , d artagnan reassured them ; and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer , as his master had come out safe from the palais cardinal .: 55.68
<S> but , he went on with his peculiar smile , i am here in paris , and have plenty of time before me by and by will do for that . with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home .: 49.46
<S> then , having removed a plank from his floor , and nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath , in which the interrogatories were made , he heard all that passed between the inquisitors and the accused .: 51.11
<S> the game at tennis , which , upon a sign from grimaud , monsieur de beaufort had consented to play , began in the afternoon .: 38.29
<S> the other , of mature age , seemed to have the former one under her charge , and was cold , dry and yellow the true type of a duenna or a devotee .: 69.12
<S> the past , like the country through which we walk , becomes indistinct as we advance .: 109.98
<S> as he was passing the alle e des veuves , he thought he saw the count s horses standing at gosset s shooting gallery ; he approached , and soon recognized the coachman .: 58.04
<S> his name , tell it me ! then in spite of my cries , in spite of my resistance for i began to comprehend that there was a question of something worse than death the executioner seized me , threw me on the floor , fastened me with his bonds , and suffocated by sobs , almost without sense , invoking god , who did not listen to me , i uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and shame .: 54.30
<S> he had started the previous evening , and had only returned an hour since .: 20.52
<S> this is the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following subject , which has not yet been treated upon , and in which i perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est . d artagnan , whose erudition we are well acquainted with , evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of m. de tre ville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that d artagnan had received from the duke of buckingham .: 88.48
<S> one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy ; for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter , he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe .: 44.25
<S> our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the frenchman at first sight .: 120.56
<S> who has paid me this attention ? my mistress , sir .: 47.63
<S> mousqueton followed him upon an auvergne horse , small but very handsome .: 156.31
<S> besides , maximilian morrel , though hardly two and twenty , had great influence over his father .: 61.48
<S> but , no ; on reflection , the procureur was not a merciless man ; and it was not the magistrate , slave to his duties , but the friend , the loyal friend , who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption ; it was not the executioner , but the surgeon , who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law .: 48.72
<S> fernand , kneeling by her side , took her hand , and covered it with kisses that merce de s did not even feel .: 19.26
<S> this example was imitated by the rest , until the room filled silently , as if these men had been the humblest , most devoted courtiers .: 71.29
<S> be good enough to hurry yourself a little , monsieur monk . as for raoul , he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him , turning his head away in repulsion .: 64.41
<S> well , he shall live ! merce de s uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristo s eyes ; but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously , for , doubtless , god had sent some angel to collect them far more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir .: 62.68
<S> there is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation , and residing not twenty yards from you .: 64.10
<S> whitehall .: 245.37
<S> those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem , and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as sublime .: 118.36
<S> i will return soon to learn the result of your trip . the stranger went out .: 28.23
<S> that s another matter .: 29.91
<S> at present i no longer think of it , and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government . well , then , your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that i have noticed on your monuments , and which have no heraldic meaning whatever .: 47.21
<S> ah , the traitor ! and he disappeared .: 22.89
<S> once there , for greater security , the young man barricaded the door .: 31.74
<S> he rose on the waves , making signs of distress ; but no one on board saw him , and the vessel stood on another tack .: 56.07
<S> the door of their cabin was opened .: 15.53
<S> you have only to wait here till i release you . d artagnan was known to this valet de chambre , who was no other than bernouin , and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the gascon a dozen times to the cardinal .: 33.70
<S> crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by mazarin , whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very dust the people , as the advocate general talon described it , had nothing left to them except their souls ; and as those could not be sold by auction , they began to murmur .: 89.36
<S> at the door he met the commissary of police , who was waiting for him .: 11.04
<S> speak . he who has negotiated these matters forgive me if i begin by speaking of myself , but i must claim that importance which has been given to me , not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal , ought , it appears to me , in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty , to be made commandant of the guards an appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers . tis the appointment monsieur de tre ville held , you ask of me . the place , madame , is vacant , and although tis a year since monsieur de tre ville has left it , it has not been filled . but it is one of the principal military appointments in the king s household . monsieur de tre ville was but a younger son of a simple gascon family , like me , madame ; he occupied that post for twenty years . you have an answer ready for everything , replied the queen , and she took from her bureau a document , which she filled up and signed .: 57.36
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> madame , said the viscount of morcerf , advancing towards the countess , yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop ; i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise , but here is my friend , whose character for veracity you well know , and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine . and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz , albert put his arm round the waist of the countess , and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers .: 52.13
<S> the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur .: 21.84
<S> well , grandpapa , said valentine , kneeling before him , and pointing to maximilian , i love him , and will be only his ; were i compelled to marry another , i would destroy myself . the eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts .: 39.01
<S> the young girl , perceiving that there was something extraordinary , looked at him steadfastly .: 21.65
<S> well , take your hat and gloves , returned monte cristo .: 22.30
<S> really , my dear gondy , said the duchess , you remind one of the apocalypse .: 25.96
<S> now , said he , i may require to go in one night from paris to tre port ; let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road , which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours . your highness had already expressed that wish , said bertuccio , and the horses are ready .: 37.20
<S> the king s musketeers are arrested by the guards of the cardinal , are they ? continued m. de tre ville , as furious at heart as his soldiers , but emphasizing his words and plunging them , one by one , so to say , like so many blows of a stiletto , into the bosoms of his auditors .: 42.12
<S> i took one of them by the throat and three quarters throttled him .: 49.80
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> my sister is happily married ; her husband is only my brother in law , that is , a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me ; no one then longer needs my useless life .: 63.45
<S> around him , and in groups , according to their fancy , lying in their mantles , or with their backs against a sort of stone bench , which went all round the columbarium , were to be seen twenty brigands or more , each having his carbine within reach .: 72.36
<S> faria bent on him his penetrating eye .: 62.45
<S> plan of campaign chapter xx .: 119.59
<S> bring it to me or rather no , no ! i may be found here , therefore help me back to my room while i have the strength to drag myself along .: 66.03
<S> milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips ; she had to deal with a gascon who played close .: 99.05
<S> the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house , not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the morrel family .: 42.06
<S> i only wish he would let me take his place . shall we not set forth ? asked the sweet , silvery voice of merce de s ; two o clock has just struck , and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour . 0071m to be sure ! to be sure ! cried dante s , eagerly quitting the table ; let us go directly ! his words were re echoed by the whole party , with vociferous cheers .: 33.63
<S> besides , what is required of a young man in paris ?: 21.92
<S> take a post chaise or a carriage . no , it would delay me , and i need the fatigue you warn me of ; it will do me good . albert reeled as if he had been shot , and fell on a chair near the door .: 39.17
<S> has the queen any further commands for me now ? asked d artagnan .: 25.28
<S> how can we be implicated in any way ?: 30.19
<S> it is , then , the cardinal s custom to walk in his orangery ? asked d artagnan .: 24.31
<S> you must be cruelly bored here . that was my intention ; but , my dear friend , i have one thing to confess to you . what s that ? it is that as i was cruelly bored , as you say , and as i had the seventy five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me , in order to amuse myself i invited a gentleman who was traveling this way to walk up , and proposed a cast of dice .: 39.65
<S> his mind was torn by doubt , grief , and despair .: 39.26
<S> he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil , and then the visit the abbe had himself paid to his house on the day of valentine s death .: 31.02
<S> well , then , go , wait for me there , and i will soon join you . you leave me , then ? yes ; i also have a pious visit to pay . morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him ; then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city .: 31.51
<S> it would be impossible to describe mousqueton s astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching , followed by a sergeant with a dozen men .: 29.85
<S> certainly not , replied the count .: 14.66
<S> young man , said he to d artagnan , a suggestion . what ? you may get into trouble by what has taken place . you believe so ? yes .: 38.92
<S> aramis , less self controlled , fumbled continually with his hidden poniard .: 219.94
<S> and what do you know about them , monsieur ?: 13.81
<S> the devil take the constitutional government , and since we had our choice , as they say , at least , how could we choose that ? i understand ; you must lay in a stock of hilarity . do not run down m. danglars speeches , said debray ; he votes for you , for he belongs to the opposition . pardieu , that is exactly the worst of all .: 40.30
<S> what !: 14.83
<S> one by the post , madame danglars footman left the other . let madame danglars know that i accept the place she offers me in her box .: 74.64
<S> the horses only arrived at two o clock , and the cicerone did not bring the passport till three .: 41.58
<S> ah , said i , after four hours work , since we are sinking , let us sink ; we can die but once . is that the example you set , penelon ? cries the captain ; very well , wait a minute . he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols .: 54.11
<S> that is of the first importance . attend to it , then , at once . unfortunately , it is a thing that i can t perform at any time i choose .: 36.70
<S> non inutile desiderium oblatione . go to the devil with your latin .: 126.37
<S> they were , therefore , somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage , athos starting out from the pont neuf , porthos by the rue de la roule , d artagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain l auxerrois , and aramis by the rue de bethisy .: 36.53
<S> so much do i esteem them that i am going to make the comte de la fere a visit , that i may converse with him tete a tete , and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him , as i said before , to the pavilion of the orangery ; that , you know , is my daily promenade .: 45.03
<S> the man in the mantle advanced towards me , but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his hand .: 24.50
<S> the skiff lightning . chapter lxxi .: 141.60
<S> these three musketeers shall follow us , said he , in an undertone .: 23.52
<S> caderousse approached him just as danglars , whom fernand seemed most anxious to avoid , had joined him in a corner of the room .: 45.71
<S> villefort s dusty garb , his costume , which was not of courtly cut , excited the susceptibility of m. de breze , who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire .: 54.92
<S> the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade , that , though franz tried his utmost , he could not distinguish a single feature .: 47.55
<S> he then went out backward , and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him , in his enthusiasm , crying aloud , long life to the monseigneur !: 51.90
<S> lord de winter is only her brother in law . i will see her , d artagnan ! beware , athos , beware .: 23.25
<S> he found athos and aramis philosophizing .: 32.30
<S> ten minutes later the curate of st. sulpice was announced .: 18.59
<S> yes , monsieur , it is here he lives , the servant replied to planchet , who was not in livery .: 38.40
<S> i have paid you five hundred of them . that s correct , said the captain .: 13.94
<S> milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced .: 64.21
<S> the officer followed her .: 20.77
<S> i am not without a good reason for my conduct , replied the banker .: 25.53
<S> the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese ; but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged .: 49.45
<S> bonacieux , throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands .: 34.54
<S> mademoiselle danglars ! exclaimed andrea , stupefied .: 26.37
<S> you could not help thinking of it , and saying to yourself , you , who pursue crime so vindictively , answer now , why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling ? the baroness became pale .: 81.36
<S> a man whose name is franz d e pinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them . no , he arrived accompanied simply by the guest i am going to present to you . ah , this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus , a perseus freeing andromeda . no , he is a man about my own size . armed to the teeth ? he had not even a knitting needle . but he paid your ransom ? he said two words to the chief and i was free . and they apologized to him for having carried you off ? said beauchamp .: 79.24
<S> to learn more about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and how your efforts and donations can help , see sections 3 and 4 and the foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org .: 29.23
<S> you who have chateau , meadows , mountains , woods you who have forty thousand francs a year you are not happy ? my dear friend , all those things i have , but i am a hermit in the midst of superfluity . surrounded , i suppose , only by clodhoppers , with whom you could not associate . porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine .: 51.71
<S> in the first place you have plenty of money , haven t you ?: 28.56
<S> but , pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles , an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given .: 70.19
<S> if he only remains here a fortnight , and pays for what he drinks , i shall soon re establish my business . and don t forget , said d artagnan , to bring up four bottles of the same sort for the two english gentlemen . and now , said athos , while they bring the wine , tell me , d artagnan , what has become of the others , come ! d artagnan related how he had found porthos in bed with a strained knee , and aramis at a table between two theologians .: 43.93
<S> but he stopped , doubtless to reflect ; for instead of allowing his first impulse , which had been to go straight to lord de winter , to carry him away , he leisurely descended the staircase , left the palace with his head down , mounted his horse , which he reined in at the corner of the rue richelieu , and with his eyes fixed on the gate , waited until the queen s carriage had left the court .: 31.39
<S> because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone , and never practices in the presence of anyone . not even before you , philip ?: 69.16
<S> at least , when the woman is rich and the lover is not , that which he can not offer she offers to herself ; and although it is generally with her husband s money that she procures herself this indulgence , the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him .: 68.21
<S> felton , as pale as death , remained some instants with his ear bent and listening ; then , when the sound was quite extinct , he breathed like a man awaking from a dream , and rushed out of the apartment .: 30.58
<S> i will sign it to morrow . i can assure her majesty that if she does not sign to day she will not have time to sign to morrow .: 41.25
<S> god was still in his heart .: 31.46
<S> now , gentlemen , a sortie ! cried athos .: 17.96
<S> his carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart , said julie .: 59.51
<S> you do not avoid going to war by that means ; you see , the cardinal is about to make the next campaign , helm on head and partisan in hand .: 65.13
<S> what am i ? the law .: 30.36
<S> the first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder ; and i expected to see him leave rueil in the same way as samson left gaza .: 61.23
<S> the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the ho tel de londres , abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino , civita vecchia , ostia , and gae ta , as on those of corsica , tuscany , and spain ; and further , franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo , proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended .: 108.44
<S> have no society , no neighbors ? our companions will be riding horses , dogs to hunt with , and a fishing boat . exactly what i wish for ; i will apprise my mother of my intention , and return to you . but shall you be allowed to go into normandy ? i may go where i please . yes , i am aware you may go alone , since i once met you in italy but to accompany the mysterious monte cristo ? you forget , count , that i have often told you of the deep interest my mother takes in you . woman is fickle . said francis i. ; woman is like a wave of the sea , said shakespeare ; both the great king and the great poet ought to have known woman s nature well . woman s , yes ; my mother is not woman , but a woman . as i am only a humble foreigner , you must pardon me if i do not understand all the subtle refinements of your language . what i mean to say is , that my mother is not quick to give her confidence , but when she does she never changes . ah , yes , indeed , said monte cristo with a sigh ; and do you think she is in the least interested in me ? i repeat it , you must really be a very strange and superior man , for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited , that when i am with her she speaks of no one else . and does she try to make you dislike me ? on the contrary , she often says , morcerf , i believe the count has a noble nature ; try to gain his esteem . indeed ? said monte cristo , sighing .: 51.12
<S> father , said the young man , i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo , the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you . you are most welcome , monsieur , said the count of morcerf , saluting monte cristo with a smile , and monsieur has rendered our house , in preserving its only heir , a service which insures him our eternal gratitude . as he said these words , the count of morcerf pointed to a chair , while he seated himself in another opposite the window .: 32.55
<S> where is be thune , athos ? why , upon the frontiers of artois and of flanders .: 63.48
<S> cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure .: 37.10
<S> do you say , asked the gascon , timidly , that the comte de la fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to monsieur du vallon and myself ? yes , sir . then you have seen him ? certainly i have . where ?: 17.97
<S> i killed the duke of buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain ; i have punished him for his injustice , that is all . de winter , stupefied , looked on while the soldiers bound felton , and could not tell what to think of such insensibility .: 75.75
<S> or dreamed he was , and awoke mad . after all , said the inspector , if he had been rich , he would not have been here . so the matter ended for the abbe faria .: 51.82
<S> i heard the name of rochefort .: 18.53
<S> let us , therefore , wait patiently for some favorable moment , and when it presents itself , profit by it . ah , said dante s , you might well endure the tedious delay ; you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself , and when weary with toil , you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you . i assure you , replied the old man , i did not turn to that source for recreation or support . what did you do then ? i wrote or studied . were you then permitted the use of pens , ink , and paper ? oh , no , answered the abbe ; i had none but what i made for myself . you made paper , pens and ink ? yes . dante s gazed with admiration , but he had some difficulty in believing .: 46.87
<S> i yet feel his warm tears on my face , and his were not the only tears shed , for many who witnessed our meeting wept also . monte cristo gently smiled and said , i was there ; at the same time pointing to the corner of a street .: 85.32
<S> it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work , in order to have , if wanted , the right of using reprisals ; but we must not believe everything ministers say , nor everything their enemies say .: 98.89
<S> then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper .: 90.26
<S> and when shall we have the honor of seeing you again , your excellency ? asked cavalcanti .: 14.52
<S> without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly shaken . and what bastion is it ? asked a dragoon , with his saber run through a goose which he was taking to be cooked .: 63.35
<S> two open ... ings have been made in these caves ; the treasure is in the furthest a ... ngle in the second ; which treasure i bequeath and leave en ... tire to him as my sole heir .: 102.74
<S> you smile . yes . why do you do so ? i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own .: 47.70
<S> besides , it began to grow late , and then , as today , people went to bed early in the quarter of the luxembourg .: 38.81
<S> i am seized with a terrible , perhaps mortal illness ; i can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching .: 103.76
<S> no , cried d artagnan , no steel .: 21.95
<S> here is what you are looking for , he said .: 16.67
<S> i feel myself drawn toward you i , who have never loved anyone but my benefactor i who have met with nothing but traitors and impious men .: 105.74
<S> what do you fear ? that we may be discovered . the door is locked . they may tell us to open it . they may if they like , but we will not . you are a perfect amazon , euge nie ! and the two young girls began to heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require .: 54.67
<S> ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to halt .: 28.25
<S> the officer looked at me with astonishment , and then said , what is your business with me , monsieur ?: 16.06
<S> morrel examined the ledgers , opened the portfolio , and counted the money .: 68.91
<S> higher , monsieur , higher . of madame d aiguillon ? still higher . of madame de chevreuse ? higher , much higher . of the d artagnan checked himself .: 136.72
<S> does madame de morcerf dance ? never ; you can talk to her , she so delights in your conversation . indeed ? 30283m yes , truly ; and i assure you .: 73.14
<S> let me see , said the count ; are you not the marquis bartolomeo cavalcanti ? bartolomeo cavalcanti , joyfully replied the italian ; yes , i am really he . ex major in the austrian service ? was i a major ? timidly asked the old soldier .: 52.76
<S> the oval face was lengthened , his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution ; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought ; his eyes were full of melancholy , and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred ; his complexion , so long kept from the sun , had now that pale color which produces , when the features are encircled with black hair , the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north ; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression ; and he had also acquired , being naturally of a goodly stature , that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself .: 143.63
<S> athos , according to his system , neither encouraged nor dissuaded him .: 43.42
<S> what can i do for you , valentine ? valentine looked around her ; she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtier s eyes .: 25.22
<S> now , my dear host , while your young man was insensible , you did not fail , i am quite sure , to ascertain what that pocket contained .: 47.90
<S> the three young people separated that is to say , morrel went to the boulevards , cha teau renaud to the pont de la re volution , and debray to the quai .: 28.40
<S> a sublime action , at all events , for mousqueton looked upon himself as dead .: 64.51
<S> but his temper cooled down , like his friend s ; he not only gets used to his captivity , but jokes about it . so much the better , said athos .: 56.04
<S> it was situated in a very private spot .: 27.66
<S> no , certainly not . you were sent by some other person ? yes . by the excellent abbe busoni ? exactly so , said the delighted major .: 35.18
<S> thank him , then , madame , if you have any affection for me . milady frowned slightly ; a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow , and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man , who saw and observed this triple shade , almost shuddered at it .: 33.77
<S> rumor will probably be busy respecting me , my occupations , my manner of living that will signify but little , that concerns god , you , and myself . merce de s , said the count , i do not say it to blame you , but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by m. de morcerf ; half of it at least by right belonged to you , in virtue of your vigilance and economy . i perceive what you are intending to propose to me ; but i can not accept it , edmond my son would not permit it . nothing shall be done without the full approbation of albert de morcerf .: 62.28
<S> whilst these projects were being formed by the duc de beaufort and grimaud , the comte de la fere and the vicomte de bragelonne were entering paris by the rue du faubourg saint marcel .: 22.73
<S> what took place at portsmouth august 23 , 1628 felton took leave of milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk takes leave of his sister , kissing her hand .: 80.88
<S> yes , yes , he murmured , i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke . his first idea was to breathe , that he might know whether he was wounded .: 22.38
<S> you would not fight a duel ? asked albert in his turn , astonished at this strange theory .: 30.83
<S> i , indeed , invited them here today on your account .: 42.68
<S> fortunately , nothing is lost by this delay , and you are now about to hear it .: 39.95
<S> athos made him a sign to go to d artagnan s residence , and bring back some clothes .: 21.85
<S> oh , my mother ! exclaimed albert , so overcome he could scarcely speak ; it is not the same with you and me you can not have made the same resolution i have , for i have come to warn you that i bid adieu to your house , and and to you . i also , replied merce de s , am going , and i acknowledge i had depended on your accompanying me ; have i deceived myself ? mother , said albert with firmness .: 41.17
<S> he extinguished the lamp , carefully concealed it , and then went away , closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended .: 44.16
<S> then i will add two words about the young greek girl . monte cristo motioned him to be silent .: 29.29
<S> go to bed , or at least lie down in your clothes .: 36.93
<S> come , do not affect indifference , but confess you were pleased to have it . oh , it is very well as a finish to the toilet .: 57.72
<S> this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken , but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness , and julie did not dare to disobey .: 28.15
<S> general information about project gutenberg electronic works professor michael s. hart was the originator of the project gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone .: 10.30
<S> do you not see ? returned the count , that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow sufferer does not perish with him ?: 59.15
<S> whose is the ocean upon which we look ?: 222.16
<S> but how do you procure a light ? oh , here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen . and matches ? i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin , and asked for a little sulphur , which was readily supplied . dante s laid the different things he had been looking at on the table , and stood with his head drooping on his breast , as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of faria s mind .: 39.40
<S> i will give them .: 15.02
<S> truly , my daughter , replied he with a smile , you are all you boast of being , excepting one thing ; i will not too hastily tell you which , but would rather leave you to guess it . euge nie looked at danglars , much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride , with which she had so superbly decked herself , should be disputed .: 58.21
<S> let us see , for you know , my dear captain , a judge must hear both sides . good lord !: 43.02
<S> the sport was bad ; franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges , and , like every unsuccessful sportsman , he returned to the boat very much out of temper .: 84.57
<S> submit this honour to somebody else . and he sat down .: 62.08
<S> one of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of anne of austria for mme .: 27.88
<S> so much the better . are we then to go to war ? by my troth , yes . against whom ? are you a politician , friend ? not in the least . are you for mazarin or for the princes ? i am for no one . that is to say , you are for us .: 30.58
<S> scarcely had i covered it with earth , when the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me ; i saw a shadow rise , and , at the same time , a flash of light .: 32.45
<S> an instant afterward the three young men separated , agreeing to meet again at four o clock with athos , and leaving planchet to guard the house .: 35.44
<S> consider , monsieur , the thing is absolutely impossible . monsieur bonacieux , said the commissary , looking at the accused as if his little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of hearts , you have a wife ? yes , monsieur , replied the mercer , in a tremble , feeling that it was at this point affairs were likely to become perplexing ; that is to say , i had one . what , you had one ?: 42.96
<S> hardly had he read the letter , when his wife entered .: 45.92
<S> after the death of barrois my suspicions were directed towards an angel , those suspicions which , even when there is no crime , are always alive in my heart ; but after the death of valentine , there has been no doubt in my mind , madame , and not only in mine , but in those of others ; thus your crime , known by two persons , suspected by many , will soon become public , and , as i told you just now , you no longer speak to the husband , but to the judge . 50165m the young woman hid her face in her hands .: 56.25
<S> yes , i know that , said d artagnan , and you mentioned it to me ; but who knows what has become of him ?: 13.83
<S> i should have thought that his duchess oh , porthos s duchess is dressed by her husband s clerks , said d artagnan , laughing .: 30.80
<S> merce de s was much changed within the last few days ; not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire ; nor indeed , had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery ; no , the change in merce de s was that her eye no longer sparkled , her lips no longer smiled , and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit .: 86.28
<S> the baron , attracted by the noise , in his chamber gown , his sword under his arm , stood in the doorway .: 28.87
<S> the next morning at daybreak , valentine and morrel were walking arm in arm on the seashore , valentine relating how monte cristo had appeared in her room , explained everything , revealed the crime , and , finally , how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death .: 81.09
<S> another gasconade ! murmured the gentleman .: 59.98
<S> you gave your direction to no one but your postilion , yet i have your address , and in proof i am here the very instant you are going to sit at table .: 60.15
<S> a gleam , like a flash of lightning , illumined the road , and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls , which were fired wildly in the air .: 39.78
<S> the officer desired to have milady s packages pointed out to him , and ordered them to be placed in the boat .: 32.03
<S> as to felton , he hesitates .: 28.04
<S> he felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do .: 70.12
<S> the old patron did not interfere , for he too had recognized the superiority of dante s over the crew and himself .: 38.79
<S> being naturally goodhearted , and having had once a liking for athos , which had grown into a sincere friendship , he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength , instead of a drunkard .: 102.06
<S> there may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood . did you see nothing there ? asked the count .: 26.24
<S> forward !: 39.95
<S> now , that way of joining them is not very attractive to me , i confess .: 35.28
<S> he was going toward the door when mazarin stopped him .: 26.46
<S> 500,000 ? the same expression continued .: 201.12
<S> it was the duc de beaufort , who was coming from the vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the parisians , intoxicated with joy .: 24.96
<S> oh , great city , it is in thy palpitating bosom that i have found that which i sought ; like a patient miner , i have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence .: 162.89
<S> many small donations 1 to 5,000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs .: 53.71
<S> when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz , the pupil of m. noirtier s eye began to dilate , and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak , and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son .: 34.44
<S> as for that benedetto , who so grossly belied his name , have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone , or what has become of him ? no ; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself , i should shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast .: 76.92
<S> they fetch a doctor , who opens the dead body , and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon .: 66.56
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to him .: 40.97
<S> no !: 15.96
<S> and with my grandfather s consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you . valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone , that nothing but morrel s intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them .: 55.42
<S> a gesture , a smile and a word from grimaud , all at once , were so unusual that his highness stopped short , astounded .: 74.31
<S> we need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk .: 77.12
<S> to answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges , and i only acknowledge you as my executioners . and in the middle of a deathlike silence , charles , calm , lofty , and with his head still covered , sat down again in his arm chair .: 49.76
<S> edmond had all the night to work in , but in the darkness he could not do much , and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard ; he pushed back his bed , and waited for day .: 41.17
<S> quite , quite alone , replied the man or , at least , practically so , for my poor wife , who is the only person in the house besides myself , is laid up with illness , and unable to render me the least assistance , poor thing ! you are married , then ? said the priest , with a show of interest , glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment .: 53.81
<S> happen what will , the devil take them , they can t eat us . and he mounted his horse .: 49.76
<S> oh , you ll know it someday , aramis ; but at present i must imitate the discretion of the doctor s niece . aramis smiled , as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain evening .: 39.18
<S> yes , yes , murmured he , i have often felt regret for the victim , but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin . athos shook his dead doubtfully .: 49.07
<S> tre ville understood admirably the war method of that period , in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy must live at the expense of his compatriots .: 47.54
<S> here s a promising fellow and it is i who have found out his merits , said monsieur de chavigny .: 35.93
<S> the palace of justice would not be burned down for everybody , monseigneur . you think , then , that the fire at the palace of justice was not caused by chance ? asked richelieu , in the tone with which he would have put a question of no importance .: 34.71
<S> all this was answered by an expression of d artagnan s .: 17.90
<S> sign it , then ! caderousse signed it .: 48.61
<S> d artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step .: 35.30
<S> the cardinal , being left alone , reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third time .: 42.43
<S> had it been possible to save you , i should have considered it another proof of god s mercy , and i would again have endeavored to restore you , i swear by my father s tomb . by your father s tomb ! said caderousse , supported by a supernatural power , and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred ; who , then , are you ? the count had watched the approach of death .: 43.53
<S> here it is , answered the other .: 16.24
<S> and that one thing , your lost child . ah , said the major , taking a second biscuit , that consummation of my happiness was indeed wanting . the worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and sighed .: 50.63
<S> then d avrigny spoke .: 35.05
<S> yes , your excellency , said the captain , we have reached it . we have reached it ! repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable sadness .: 24.06
<S> will you accompany me to the harbor , maximilian ? 50233m i am entirely yours , count . morrel accompanied the count to the harbor .: 40.07
<S> an opportunity will come , replied rochefort .: 39.47
<S> but , once started , he could not stop .: 30.45
<S> but when he was alone with the hostess he said : now , pretty madeleine , you know the difference between a swiss and a gentleman .: 47.53
<S> you know how much he loves me , my mother .: 18.98
<S> he sat down occasionally on his bed , pressing his hand on his heart .: 17.09
<S> now that she believed herself to be no longer observed , a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her countenance .: 94.29
<S> the brigands had carried me off , and conducted me to a gloomy spot , called the catacombs of saint sebastian . i know it , said cha teau renaud ; i narrowly escaped catching a fever there . and i did more than that , replied morcerf , for i caught one .: 43.15
<S> silence , purveyor of gossip , do not spread that report .: 119.14
<S> in my opinion , a withdrawal from paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of mademoiselle danglars broken contract and m. danglars disappearance .: 94.97
<S> at that period buckingham was an ally , and not an enemy .: 47.29
<S> make yourself easy , we are quite alone , said andrea ; besides , we are conversing in italian . well , then , replied the major , they paid me 50,000 francs down . monsieur cavalcanti , said andrea , do you believe in fairy tales ? i used not to do so , but i really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them . you have , then , been induced to alter your opinion ; you have had some proofs of their truth ? the major drew from his pocket a handful of gold .: 31.31
<S> and you ? i am lord de winter , baron sheffield . well , then , i am your servant , monsieur baron , said d artagnan , though you have names rather difficult to recollect . and touching his horse with the spur , he cantered back to paris .: 37.08
<S> and , then , to be here so young !: 35.70
<S> he supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at bagne res , luchon , and cauterets .: 49.91
<S> you are acquainted with the young viscount , are you ? we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome . true , true , cried danglars .: 35.69
<S> i am convinced that if i gave him a box on the ear , such as i gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me , it would change the appearance of things . and i , my dear aramis , quietly replied athos , i think it would only change monsieur de retz s appearance .: 43.90
<S> look here , said the englishman .: 16.61
<S> la ramee entered ; he smiled kindly on the prisoner , for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince .: 53.77
<S> as he descended the staircase , morrel met penelon , who was going up .: 31.51
<S> his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket ; and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him , he replied that the abbe was not in paris , an answer which satisfied most persons , because the abbe was known to be a great traveller .: 64.39
<S> grimaud s agitation , his pallor , the sweat which covered his face , the dust which soiled his clothes , all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news .: 48.47
<S> well , said maximilian , death came a third time , and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word .: 42.80
<S> will you tell me that they did not lay siege to the ho tel of the duc de la tre mouille , and that they did not endeavor to burn it ? which would not , perhaps , have been a great misfortune in time of war , seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots , but which is , in time of peace , a frightful example .: 33.19
<S> the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico , two men presented themselves at the carriage window ; the one was ali , who , smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy , seemed amply repaid by a mere look from monte cristo .: 30.38
<S> he had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger , who appeared to be his agent , and he judged , with reason , he had not a moment to lose .: 30.63
<S> have they not obeyed me ? it is done ; as your excellency may have observed , your horse is in the great gateway , ready saddled for your departure . that is well ; do as i have directed you , then . what the devil ! said the host to himself .: 35.22
<S> he questioned jacopo .: 44.45
<S> the ball chapter 71 .: 33.22
<S> pray tell me how . i separated the fat from the meat served to me , melted it , and so made oil here is my lamp . so saying , the abbe exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations .: 111.06
<S> the second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first .: 71.93
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> this gentleman asks me for information , which common politeness will not permit me to refuse . politeness , you simpleton ! retorted la carconte .: 64.28
<S> what is this ? it is from your father . from my father ? yes ; did you not tell him just now that you wanted money ?: 26.44
<S> come and converse with us for just five minutes , sword in hand , upon this deserted terrace . one moment , gentlemen , cried flamarens .: 64.62
<S> this was the chief of the band , luigi vampa .: 18.41
<S> i have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side .: 55.13
<S> it was time .: 16.90
<S> well , have you any news ? athos asked .: 23.31
<S> the name of your ship ? inquired d artagnan .: 13.82
<S> meanwhile let us sit down and eat . caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite , praising each dish he set before his visitor .: 109.79
<S> dante s , perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father , responded by a look of grateful pleasure ; while merce de s glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond .: 33.88
<S> but he who was addressed stood there , stupefied , bewildered , stunned ; his haggard eyes glanced around , as if in search of the traces of some terrible event , and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections .: 68.22
<S> the old servant left the room , and presently returned , bringing with him a small casket .: 39.70
<S> by the orders of the deputy procureur ? i believe so . the conviction that they came from m. de villefort relieved all dante s apprehensions ; he advanced calmly , and placed himself in the centre of the escort .: 36.32
<S> they have allowed all this time to elapse , and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal , in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position .: 70.61
<S> i heard the chevalier d herblay say so . the fool ! cried blaisois , i wish i had been in his place . thou canst be , said grimaud , writing down his figures .: 46.52
<S> what has he done ?: 12.44
<S> d artagnan stopped before them , and they stopped before him .: 18.56
<S> in the eyes of many , benedetto appeared , if not a victim to , at least an instance of , the fallibility of the law .: 64.42
<S> i salute you , marie michon to this letter was added an order , conceived in these terms : at the louvre , august 10 , 1628 the superior of the convent of be thune will place in the hands of the person who shall present this note to her the novice who entered the convent upon my recommendation and under my patronage .: 106.32
<S> immediately , without any order being given or his place of destination indicated , the coachman set off at a rapid pace , and plunged into the streets of the city .: 41.85
<S> while thinking and walking , athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove , broken in halves , the other extremity passing into the chamber above ; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words , which at length fixed his attention .: 67.76
<S> i have a hundred pounds weight less upon my chest .: 48.68
<S> albert took beauchamp aside , and communicated these ideas to him .: 63.36
<S> it is in london they must be found . what are your eminence s orders ? not a word of what has passed .: 27.40
<S> danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it .: 17.41
<S> eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage . the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on , replied raoul , that i might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day ; let us push on , then , to noyon ; it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from blois to paris .: 45.49
<S> i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment . you are , then , a chemist ? somewhat ; i know lavoisier , and was the intimate friend of cabanis . but for such a work you must have needed books had you any ? i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome ; but after reading them over many times , i found out that with one hundred and fifty well chosen books a man possesses , if not a complete summary of all human knowledge , at least all that a man need really know .: 114.74
<S> a secret voice whispered to him , at the bottom of his heart , that he was but an instrument of vengeance , that he was only caressed till he had given death ; but pride , but self love , but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs .: 51.16
<S> to donate , please visit : www.gutenberg.org donate .: 22.78
<S> we shall wait for you , d artagnan , said athos , loud enough for the cardinal to hear him .: 19.76
<S> although general d e pinay served under napoleon , did he not still retain royalist sentiments ?: 153.08
<S> then he raised to his lips the repast that , like a voluntary tantalus , he refused himself ; but he thought of his oath , and he would not break it .: 37.71
<S> are they both dead ? asked lord de winter , sternly .: 19.84
<S> there they found a brig ready to set sail , upon the deck of which they recognized mordaunt walking up and down impatiently .: 75.02
<S> i think he has not been arrested , and as i am his wife s confessor , if she knows where he is i shall know it too . very well , sir , find this man , and when you have found him bring him to me . we will be with you at six o clock , my lord . go , my dear curate , and may god assist you ! and you , sir ? continued gondy , turning to the curate of st. sulpice .: 28.09
<S> so , if i do not send you more it is because i fear you would not accept a larger sum .: 42.11
<S> doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry ; for , as the carriage of the two friends passed her , she threw a bunch of violets .: 93.37
<S> yes , he said , yes , doubtless it is painful , if you violently break the outer covering which obstinately begs for life .: 74.62
<S> we fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern , and sat down by selim .: 40.36
<S> now , at the moment when i left his house here aramis paused .: 33.90
<S> as we shall probably meet with him again in the course of our history , it may be well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with him .: 36.95
<S> to donate , please visit : www.gutenberg.org donate .: 22.78
<S> what is your sister valentine doing ? inquired madame de villefort of edward ; tell someone to bid her come here , that i may have the honor of introducing her to the count . you have a daughter , then , madame ? inquired the count ; very young , i presume ? the daughter of m. de villefort by his first marriage , replied the young wife , a fine well grown girl . but melancholy , interrupted master edward , snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch , in order to make a plume for his hat .: 46.34
<S> the affair at armentieres , whispered d artagnan .: 25.85
<S> he considered himself an outraged , betrayed , and ridiculed lover .: 65.06
<S> at this moment the accuser concluded with these words : the present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the english people . at these words there was a murmur along the benches , and a second voice , not that of a woman , but a man s , stout and furious , thundered behind d artagnan .: 42.91
<S> there he had a chair made on his own plan , and one day , visiting anne of austria in this chair , she asked him , charmed as she was with his wit , if he did not wish for a title .: 41.80
<S> our blow has failed for to night ; let us withdraw .: 69.01
<S> they seemed to understand each other so well , said monte cristo with renewed energy .: 39.43
<S> i shrink before nothing but impossibilities . nothing is impossible , replied milady , to true love . nothing , madame ? nothing , replied milady .: 62.51
<S> by jove , my lord , said d artagnan , you have well said , but these are only words .: 27.82
<S> to horse , my friends , to horse ! and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to be thune .: 24.52
<S> i thought i was right in believing that cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow .: 45.16
<S> the invalid s eye remained fixed , by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable .: 73.48
<S> his honor s equipage is waiting , said mousqueton .: 40.00
<S> the count had , indeed , just arrived , but he was in his bath , and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted .: 28.01
<S> still he had not even uttered a sigh .: 27.32
<S> is this all ? no , i have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of pascal , and the house of wild turner of marseilles , amounting to nearly 55,000 francs ; in all , 287,500 francs . it is impossible to describe what morrel suffered during this enumeration .: 41.79
<S> you have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men , and unfortunately you have always succeeded ; but i give you leave to try them upon this one .: 63.30
<S> morrel called her , and she ran to the gate .: 20.07
<S> i believe the storm is over , said he .: 18.15
<S> i recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of the sea ; and if you come another fathom nearer , i ll stave your wicked head in with this oar . d artagnan !: 65.68
<S> do you see this firman ? i do , said my father .: 18.68
<S> giving him to understand that the police would deal with him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord for in the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a great lord he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness d artagnan should get up and depart as quickly as possible .: 84.57
<S> i returned last night , and here i am . what circumlocution !: 43.86
<S> every few minutes he turned around , and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves .: 66.67
<S> villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration .: 99.70
<S> i thought so ; but we will return to my lord duke presently .: 49.34
<S> they may hear us . i don t understand it at all . as you execute you will understand . and yet i should have preferred you will have the pleasure of the surprise . ah , that is true . hush ! porthos remained silent and motionless .: 33.48
<S> but presently the exempt s face suddenly brightened .: 367.68
<S> oh ! said porthos .: 8.55
<S> that s it , said the duke , now make me a little hole in the floor whilst i go and fetch the culprit . la ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor ; meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread .: 41.65
<S> i imitate neither manfred nor anthony ; but without words , protestations , or vows , my life has entwined itself with yours ; you leave me , and you are right in doing so , i repeat it , you are right ; but in losing you , i lose my life .: 47.67
<S> so much the better ! but what has de rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room ? ah , sir !: 43.24
<S> you can not think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger .: 84.86
<S> well , cried he , with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world , my cavalier has attained his object .: 50.59
<S> it is a brawl ; and the proof is that there were five of the cardinal s guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur d artagnan . that is true , said the king ; but never mind , tre ville , come still by the back staircase . tre ville smiled ; but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master , he saluted the king respectfully , and with this agreement , took leave of him .: 34.01
<S> then he looked about for something to pour the soup into ; dante s entire dinner service consisted of one plate there was no alternative .: 153.07
<S> poisons act particularly on some organ or another one on the stomach , another on the brain , another on the intestines .: 146.41
<S> he had found in m. de busigny , who , by the by , had given them a magnificent dinner , a partner worthy of his company .: 38.50
<S> simpleton ! exclaimed mousqueton ; suppose any one came into the room . ah , true , cried blaisois , with evident admiration ; but it will be dark in the cellar . grimaud always sees , dark or light , night as well as day , answered mousqueton .: 63.12
<S> maximilian , maximilian , he said , the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a christian . oh , do not fear , my friend , said morrel , raising his head , and smiling with a sweet expression on the count ; i shall no longer attempt my life . then we are to have no more pistols no more despair ? no ; i have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife . poor fellow , what is it ? my grief will kill me of itself . my friend , said monte cristo , with an expression of melancholy equal to his own , listen to me .: 28.33
<S> i will read you the letter containing the accusation , at least , said villefort : the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country , that one named edmond dante s , mate of the ship pharaon , this day arrived from smyrna , after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo , has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper , and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris .: 32.92
<S> we are ready . ah , sir , you have a noble heart ! exclaimed the queen , with a burst of gratitude ; whilst lord de winter turned to her with a glance which said , did i not answer for them ? but you , sir ? said the queen to aramis .: 18.76
<S> i made no resistance ; i was no longer master of my senses .: 24.02
<S> to the huguenots as places of safety , there only remained la rochelle .: 123.56
<S> diavolo !: 35.10
<S> the sea , knowing what was required of her , threw over them her weeds , encircled them with coral , and encrusted them with shells ; the whole was cemented by two hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths , for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial , and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea .: 89.50
<S> the cemetery of pe re lachaise chapter 106 .: 18.55
<S> bonacieux ; that he had never spoken to the one or the other ; that he had come , at about ten o clock in the evening , to pay a visit to his friend m. d artagnan , but that till that hour he had been at m. de tre ville s , where he had dined .: 21.10
<S> these bitter sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes , sometimes longer , but always finished thus : monsieur de chavigny , turning toward the door , used to call out : halloo !: 79.73
<S> monte cristo , on the contrary , took the right hand ; arrived near a clump of trees , he stopped .: 22.68
<S> the house of thomson french had 300,000 or 400,000 francs to pay this month in france ; and , knowing your strict punctuality , have collected all the bills bearing your signature , and charged me as they became due to present them , and to employ the money otherwise . morrel sighed deeply , and passed his hand over his forehead , which was covered with perspiration .: 50.88
<S> however , as far as ali is concerned , i can assure you , the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant you , who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris . really ?: 62.99
<S> in the meantime d artagnan was defiling with his company .: 20.13
<S> monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward .: 119.76
<S> i was a very insignificant person . do not speak thus , for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy ; everything is relative , my dear young friend , from the king who stands in the way of his successor , to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place .: 60.15
<S> on guard , then , monsieur , on guard ! bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice .: 44.77
<S> she only felt the pulsation in her own fingers , and withdrew her hand with a shudder .: 34.21
<S> you have a good memory ; repeat what i have told you .: 23.32
<S> young people stop there ! said the tutor , joining in the conversation .: 52.86
<S> when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied ; but being anxious not to be too conspicuous , all , with the exception of porthos , who had a fancy to display his red doublet , were quite satisfied with their places , the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row , so that they were exactly opposite the arm chair prepared for the royal prisoner .: 70.86
<S> barrois touched a spring , the false bottom came out , and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string .: 83.91
<S> at this sight franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow .: 24.86
<S> but , after all , said he , lowering the point of his spit , where is this letter ? yes , where is this letter ? cried d artagnan .: 14.42
<S> la ramee carried off all his clothes , in order to be certain that the duke would not stir .: 27.78
<S> bernouin introduced him .: 57.33
<S> so i went to danglars , who would not even receive me .: 38.74
<S> i forgot there were three more steps before the landing . you have hurt yourself , perhaps , said morrel .: 52.05
<S> look here , resumed d artagnan ; here is monsieur de bragelonne , who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of broussel and whom i had great difficulty to prevent defending monsieur de comminges . the devil ! said porthos ; and his guardian , what would he have said to that ? do you hear ? interrupted d artagnan ; become a frondist , my friend , belong to the fronde , and remember that i fill the count s place in everything ; and he jingled his money .: 34.95
<S> a letter from charles the first .: 93.17
<S> he took a seat , and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary .: 21.70
<S> knew all , and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days , which , likewise , was characteristic .: 49.69
<S> the musketeers saluted bicarat with their swords , and returned them to their sheaths .: 30.35
<S> he thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself .: 44.19
<S> however , a few instants after she had finished her religious song , milady thought she heard a profound sigh .: 57.93
<S> adieu , edmond , adieu , and thank you . but the count did not answer .: 17.76
<S> no ; i should only regret if the horse had not proved good . it is so good , that i have distanced m. de cha teau renaud , one of the best riders in france , and m. debray , who both mount the minister s arabians ; and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars , who always go at six leagues an hour . then they follow you ? asked monte cristo .: 44.25
<S> this morning , being ignorant that i should have the honor of seeing your majesty , i encumbered myself with this dress , but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majesty s service , in whatever way you may see fit to use me . the abbe d herblay , resumed de winter , is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis xiii. , of whom i have spoken to you , madame . then turning to athos , he continued , and this gentleman is that noble comte de la fere , whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty . gentlemen , said the queen , a few years ago i had around me ushers , treasures , armies ; and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service .: 42.16
<S> but it is your own fault .: 16.53
<S> i set out three days ago , passing miraculously through the puritan army , and i took post horses with my servant tony ; the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in paris .: 82.85
<S> very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers ; well , they see a vessel , and good fellows like us on board , they come and demand hospitality of us ; you can t refuse help to a poor hunted devil ; we receive them , and for greater security we stand out to sea .: 98.75
<S> well , after all , said d artagnan , supposing that he lives , that he comes to paris ; we have seen many other such .: 26.71
<S> at this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor .: 24.03
<S> neither could give the others any information , for all were ignorant who this man could be ; nevertheless , they felt convinced that all was as it should be , as it was done by the order of athos .: 50.63
<S> then he bowed a second time and retired .: 30.70
<S> there was a postscript : i write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his convent . in his convent !: 83.09
<S> listen , said the doctor ; i know the full importance of the statement i have just made , and the disposition of the man to whom i have made it . do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend ? asked villefort .: 20.54
<S> why , in the first place i gave you fifty . you think so ? pardieu ! ah , that is true .: 18.57
<S> but , he added , in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung . the deuce they do ! said mousqueton ; i think i should like the siege of rochelle better than this war , then ! porthos , meantime , asked d artagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey .: 61.03
<S> this will do , said he , and from this letter , which might have ruined me , i will make my fortune .: 25.51
<S> men were giants in those times , said athos ; now we are pigmies in comparison .: 69.29
<S> do you know him ?: 7.46
<S> and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you , and to endeavor to kill you . yes , sir , he had very good ones ; but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me , and did not even fight . yet he considered you the cause of his father s dishonor , the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house . it is true , sir , said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness ; a secondary cause , but not the principal . doubtless you made , then , some apology or explanation ? i explained nothing , and it is he who apologized to me . but to what do you attribute this conduct ? to the conviction , probably , that there was one more guilty than i. and who was that ? his father . that may be , said the count , turning pale ; but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted . i know it , and i expected this result . you expected my son would be a coward ? cried the count .: 43.19
<S> if , on the other side , it was not she which was still quite possible for the little light that remained rendered a mistake easy might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through the allurement of this woman , for whom his love was known ?: 73.19
<S> a conjugal scene at the place louis xv .: 144.69
<S> so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal s death as a deliverance ; and i , even i , opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his hand .: 53.87
<S> then an idea came to him which harmonized everything .: 80.07
<S> we hastened , therefore , to obtain permission to print it , with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others at the doors of the acade mie des inscriptions et belles lettres , if we should not succeed a very probable thing , by the by in gaining admission to the acade mie franc aise with our own proper pack .: 93.78
<S> nevertheless , he still saw grimaud with his lantern in front , advancing .: 54.27
<S> i can not now repeat to you , sir , all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of ; it was more than piety , it was more than grief , and i , who am no canter , and hate the jesuits , said then to myself , it is really well , and i am very glad that i have not any children ; for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does , and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying , i should throw myself into the sea at once , for i could not bear it . poor father ! murmured the priest .: 50.87
<S> there s a carriage coming over yonder . then bending again to raoul , he whispered : above all things do not divulge your name . that s right .: 70.59
<S> the tutor followed them .: 34.53
<S> there are only two persons who have the key to that door , murmured morrel , cocles and julie . at this instant the second door opened , and the young girl , her eyes bathed with tears , appeared .: 33.35
<S> who says this aramis is not a wit ?: 88.73
<S> ah , cried valentine suddenly , i understand .: 25.70
<S> she had still four days before her .: 31.69
<S> they who love believe easily in love .: 148.78
<S> but it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough . in any case , aramis replied , the punishment should fall not on the king , but on his ministers ; for the first article of the constitution is , the king can do no wrong . as for me , thought porthos , giving mordaunt his whole attention , were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation i would leap down from the bench , reach mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him ; i would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of france .: 78.58
<S> bonacieux prophesied .: 91.64
<S> paris !: 43.39
<S> this is the matter , gentlemen ; answer and exculpate yourselves , for i stand here to accuse you . sire , said lord leven , with hesitation , sire , your majesty has been deceived by false reports . my own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and scotland ; and i can almost say that with my own ears i have heard the clauses of the treaty debated . the scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brows .: 53.31
<S> m. de tre ville , who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it , related it in all its details to his eminence , not forgetting the episode of the napkin .: 34.88
<S> see what is going on , monsieur d artagnan , said he .: 9.88
<S> well , asked anne of austria , when d artagnan reappeared , what does it mean ? it means , madame , that the report has spread that the queen has left the palais royal , carrying off the king , and the people ask to have proof to the contrary , or threaten to demolish the palais royal . oh , this time it is too much ! exclaimed the queen , and i will prove to them i have not left . d artagnan saw from the expression of the queen s face that she was about to issue some violent command .: 30.57
<S> the pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with louis xii .: 75.98
<S> perhaps some accident has happened to him . i will hasten , replied franz .: 20.86
<S> he had us in his power and he let us go .: 41.57
<S> my dear friend , exclaimed athos , how i should admire the resources of your mind did i not stop to adore those of your heart . and he gave him his hand .: 34.27
<S> george villiers , duke of buckingham mme .: 75.17
<S> my lord , i have been so long shut up , that i am only of one party i am for fresh air .: 46.68
<S> i stopped short to tell him that he was a fool ; the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with , but whilst they were away i found means to conciliate the priests who were present , so that my foe was pelted instead of me .: 80.80
<S> behind the door keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil , which completely concealed her .: 41.20
<S> he was a foreigner ? an italian from the neighborhood of mantua , i believe . let me see this diamond again , replied the jeweller ; the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone . caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen , opened , and gave it to the jeweller .: 34.81
<S> the comte de wardes of thursday and the d artagnan of today are the same person . the imprudent young man expected a surprise , mixed with shame a slight storm which would resolve itself into tears ; but he was strangely deceived , and his error was not of long duration .: 78.97
<S> the next day , athos , leaning out of his window , which looked upon the most populous part of the city , heard the act of parliament , which summoned the ex king , charles i. , to the bar , publicly cried .: 45.11
<S> planchet ! monsieur . run and seek athos , porthos and aramis .: 56.14
<S> and this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to milady that her servants were the same men as her guards ; that is to say , soldiers .: 64.73
<S> you can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken , or if taken , will undergo martyrdom rather than speak . very well , said d artagnan , i consent to bazin with all my heart , but grant me planchet .: 56.61
<S> benedetto ? he muttered ; fatality ! half past six o clock has just struck , m. bertuccio , said the count severely ; i ordered dinner at that hour , and i do not like to wait ; and he returned to his guests , while bertuccio , leaning against the wall , succeeded in reaching the dining room .: 34.97
<S> you promise to become one of the lights of the church .: 36.23
<S> there was then amongst that crowd a moment s hesitation , which looked like shame .: 46.38
<S> as for the accused himself , many remembered him as being so amiable , so handsome , and so liberal , that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy , since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy .: 109.49
<S> albert , however , felt no less insulted ; the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult .: 90.89
<S> you must show me the proofs against him . certainly ; but you will find terrible charges . monsieur , continued dante s , i know it is not in your power to release me ; but you can plead for me you can have me tried and that is all i ask .: 38.84
<S> close by here , monsieur , replied the notary a little beyond passy ; a charming situation , in the heart of the bois de boulogne . so near as that ? said the count ; but that is not in the country .: 53.54
<S> well , it has happened to me to do so in our blaisois forests , and i remember that the first time i encountered one with its eyes fixed upon me , curled up , swinging its head and pointing its tongue , i remained fixed , pale and as though fascinated , until the moment when the comte de la fere your father ? asked de guiche .: 49.43
<S> d artagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guard s march upon the door .: 86.53
<S> brought up in paris , where raoul had been but once ; at the court , which raoul had never seen ; his follies as page ; two duels , which he had already found the means of fighting , in spite of the edicts against them and , more especially , in spite of his tutor s vigilance these things excited the greatest curiosity in raoul .: 72.18
<S> my dear , said she , as she took the pen , is it not vexatious ?: 25.62
<S> mordaunt , replied grimaud .: 27.50
<S> well , then , porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist , and i how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns .: 53.44
<S> i know the french as well as if i had made them myself .: 24.24
<S> monsieur d artagnan ! he cried , falling back a step ; it is monsieur d artagnan !: 10.97
<S> culpable , at the most , of weakness , how cruelly punished by his subjects !: 99.16
<S> after the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl a piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to burst .: 78.59
<S> do you want money ?: 22.58
<S> i swear it was time for you to come back , la ramee , and i was eager to see you again . monseigneur is too good , said la ramee , flattered by the compliment .: 23.40
<S> ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived , the one accompanied by the porter , the other by ali , and were received by the abbe busoni , who was praying by the side of the corpse .: 24.34
<S> on the staircase he met signor pastrini .: 23.30
<S> good morning , benedetto , said bertuccio , with his deep , hollow voice .: 29.01
<S> imprisonment , menaces , ill treatment she has suffered everything .: 134.36
<S> the history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick ; indeed , his griefs , hopes , and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem .: 118.02
<S> hasten , reverend sir , hasten !: 69.30
<S> friend d artagnan , continued he , speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself , if you escape , of which there is not much chance , i would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future .: 33.03
<S> all is over !: 26.05
<S> when quite a child , the little vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity .: 149.78
<S> i have lent him to a friend who will understand the signs he makes ? returned d artagnan .: 45.02
<S> but the dead can not return their fire . certainly not !: 70.82
<S> d artagnan already fancied himself , so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination , accosted by a messenger from the young woman , who brought him some billet appointing a meeting , a gold chain , or a diamond .: 66.35
<S> you never knew her . eh , madame , who knows ? said athos .: 37.41
<S> come on , here , you others , he continued , rising in his stirrups , raising his sword , and addressing those musketeers who had not been able to follow his rapid onslaught .: 34.05
<S> do you know , sir , these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds ? oh , be assured , said mordaunt , looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften , my soldiers will guard them , and guard them well , i promise you . i shall take better care of them myself , answered d artagnan ; besides , all they require is a good room , with sentinels , or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape .: 52.53
<S> there must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows . but , then , by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position ? both , sir he has both fortune and position both . this must be impossible ! it would seem so ; but listen , and you will understand .: 96.63
<S> aramis , in a black gown , his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap , not much unlike a calotte , was seated before an oblong table , covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio .: 65.22
<S> cavalcanti ! said debray .: 31.85
<S> it would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from puzzoli or sorrento .: 65.34
<S> there were in all six thousand piastres , but of these six thousand albert had already expended three thousand .: 72.93
<S> well , said porthos to aramis , we must do something . monsieur is full of generosity , said athos .: 18.63
<S> i promise you it affords me as little pleasure to revive it as it does you .: 60.08
<S> athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow ; a flash kindled in his eyes , and a bitter smile passed over his lips , then , like his comrades , he sank again into reverie .: 27.23
<S> well , we will reflect and perhaps we will beg him .: 40.27
<S> nevertheless , his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever .: 42.59
<S> see this gentleman out , said the count to bertuccio .: 44.38
<S> has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice ?: 74.25
<S> the mission with which i am charged , sir , replied the visitor , speaking with hesitation , is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it , and him by whom he is employed . the abbe bowed .: 37.11
<S> perfectly well ; quite rested , sir . you are still growing , athos continued , with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth .: 97.27
<S> and i ? asked mazarin , after a moment s silence .: 10.85
<S> i will call on you , sir , since you bid me contemplate , for the advantage of my pride , this terrible spectacle , which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family . it would have been so unquestionably , had not god given me so large a compensation .: 47.53
<S> but i thought you were a catalan , and they told me the catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival .: 41.76
<S> is the doctor afraid that you may be recognized ? i can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person ; but the face i had a large hat , said aramis .: 37.80
<S> you are right , sir , and no one can doubt my position . these were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray .: 57.32
<S> your pistols are beside your desk , said monte cristo , pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table .: 24.00
<S> the island of tiboulen chapter 22 .: 16.92
<S> there are hours which last a year .: 90.23
<S> the count had , moreover , charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the argentina .: 30.25
<S> contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below .: 29.49
<S> having acquitted themselves of their errand , and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with edmond , danglars and caderousse took their places beside fernand and old dante s , the latter of whom attracted universal notice .: 79.75
<S> he had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto ; he consequently despatched his breakfast , and , his boat being ready , he hastened on board , and they were soon under way .: 49.32
<S> towards the evening of the third day .: 41.21
<S> what do you say ? cried d artagnan .: 4.44
<S> my father thought that this action had been miraculously performed he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us .: 66.22
<S> i had no hope of getting off so easily . he gives you his word of honor , said gondy .: 34.34
<S> i passed the night on a chair , starting at the least noise , for toward midnight the lamp went out , and i was again in darkness .: 53.02
<S> dividing the proceeds chapter 107 .: 65.50
<S> behind the executioner came , in the order in which they were to die , first peppino and then andrea .: 79.02
<S> the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing room .: 42.89
<S> this man is still your friend , and you , perhaps , make use of him as your accomplice . 40160m oh , reverend sir ! since you left toulon what have you lived on ?: 52.34
<S> but villefort , raising his head , bowed down by grief , looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips .: 31.62
<S> besides , repentance becomes the guilty ; whatever crimes they may have committed , for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of god ! guilty ?: 143.65
<S> monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed .: 31.24
<S> no , said d artagnan ; no , i confess it .: 11.80
<S> at once , if you please . and you know who i am , without doubt ? i ?: 19.11
<S> the abbe s chamber chapter 18 .: 29.15
<S> d artagnan here ? himself ! but that s impossible !: 80.34
<S> he went the first time to save the honor of a great queen ; the second , to avert the death of a great king . sir , said anne to mazarin , with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression , see if we can do something for these gentlemen . i wish to do , madame , all that your majesty pleases . do what monsieur de la fere requests ; that is your name , is it not , sir ? i have another name , madame i am called athos . madame , said mazarin , with a smile , you may rest easy ; your wishes shall be fulfilled . you hear , sir ? said the queen .: 38.92
<S> why do you not join our party , my dear beauchamp ?: 24.18
<S> are you not well ? tis nothing , nothing ; it will soon pass away and as he said so the old man s strength failed him , and he fell backwards .: 41.87
<S> the marquis will give you some papers which will certify this fact , and authorize you to appear under that name in the parisian world .: 46.14
<S> ten minutes afterward planchet joined him at the stables of the ho tel des gardes .: 19.71
<S> they arrived thus , screened by the lining of the trench , till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion .: 27.07
<S> no more than a drop of water in the ocean . remember , chimed in la carconte , those two could crush you at a single blow ! how so ? inquired the abbe .: 47.00
<S> she knew her brother in law to be a worthy gentleman , a bold hunter , an intrepid player , enterprising with women , but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrigues .: 63.45
<S> it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty ; it was a man who would answer for the offence , whether trifling or serious ; it was a man who would fight , and it was evident danglars would not fight .: 43.16
<S> rochefort , rendered suspicious and cautious by these words , entered the apartment , where he found mazarin sitting at the table , dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the church , his costume being similar to that of the abbe s in that day , excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet .: 62.81
<S> d artagnan and planchet entered pierrefitte together .: 27.53
<S> good heavens ! said aramis to athos , does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his ante chamber ? my dear friend , we must take people as we find them .: 50.92
<S> ah , yes , happily i have , replied valentine .: 25.84
<S> i was trying on my wedding suit .: 81.31
<S> this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified milady , whose questions became more pressing .: 183.41
<S> i will see about the continuation of it , and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the corrections i shall have made in consequence of your advice . work slowly , said the curate ; we leave you in an excellent tone of mind . yes , the ground is all sown , said the jesuit , and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone , another upon the highway , or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest , aves c li comederunt illam . plague stifle you and your latin ! said d artagnan , who began to feel all his patience exhausted .: 64.59
<S> i said i wished to be alone , he exclaimed , on seeing the young man .: 20.18
<S> we every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork , and some meat when he asks for it ; but alas !: 94.05
<S> the valet then left the room .: 19.85
<S> villefort drew back , and clasping his hands together , exclaimed : dead ! so suddenly ? a week ago , continued madame de saint me ran , we went out together in the carriage after dinner .: 38.31
<S> from madame de montbazon ? he cried .: 18.69
<S> the coadjutor bowed and left the palace , casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes .: 85.15
<S> i was in the power of a man whom i not only detested , but despised of a man capable of anything , and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to do . but who , then , was this man ? asked felton .: 26.32
<S> in two or three hours , thought dante s , the turnkey will enter my chamber , find the body of my poor friend , recognize it , seek for me in vain , and give the alarm .: 51.40
<S> oh , how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment , in the midst of the flying bullets , his scimitar in his hand , and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies !: 57.80
<S> but how , unless a miracle should restore your speech , your gesture , your movement , how can you , chained to that armchair , dumb and motionless , oppose this marriage ? a smile lit up the old man s face , a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face .: 75.81
<S> there were collected and piled up all albert s successive caprices , hunting horns , bass viols , flutes a whole orchestra , for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music ; easels , palettes , brushes , pencils for music had been succeeded by painting ; foils , boxing gloves , broadswords , and single sticks for , following the example of the fashionable young men of the time , albert de morcerf cultivated , with far more perseverance than music and drawing , the three arts that complete a dandy s education , i.e. , fencing , boxing , and single stick ; and it was here that he received grisier , cooks , and charles leboucher .: 147.41
<S> he reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson cataract .: 98.10
<S> the result was , that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose .: 66.17
<S> what , are there no grottos at monte cristo ? he asked .: 37.36
<S> but for d artagnan all aspects were clothed happily , all ideas wore a smile , all shades were diaphanous .: 150.30
<S> our friend will see you soon , and he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your safety required you should be concealed .: 66.46
<S> since it is opened , i will take advantage of it to enter your room ; do not disturb yourself do not disturb yourself ! and passing his hand through the broken glass , the count opened the door .: 34.07
<S> it is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs , stools , and crockery ; but two or three scratches made by the gascon s blade terrified them .: 47.87
<S> we hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to flanders .: 40.85
<S> and yet , at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts .: 40.24
<S> la carconte double locked the door behind the jeweller . chapter 45 .: 57.97
<S> the eyes of porthos were furtively cast upon this lady , and then roved about at large over the nave .: 80.20
<S> i shall be at vendin to place it in position .: 50.48
<S> no nonsense , my good fellow ; silver simply , round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them .: 91.86
<S> as to the rest , the life of the four young friends was joyous enough .: 23.91
<S> call the prince ; inform him that it is his turn to sign , cried danglars to one of the floorkeepers .: 44.84
<S> the case had been provided for : if marie michon should be threatened with any danger the queen was to send her a prayer book bound in green velvet . that is true , monsieur , you are well informed . one morning the green book was brought to her by the prince de marsillac .: 65.65
<S> my wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares , or the caprices of any man , but to be an artist , and consequently free in heart , in person , and in thought . euge nie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to valentine s cheeks .: 64.14
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> he gave me this paper ; it contains the number of my new abode ; read it yourself , and monte cristo passed a paper to albert .: 52.88
<S> such as you see me i am , a sort of philosopher , and one day perhaps i shall go to paris to rival monsieur appert , and the man in the little blue cloak . and will that be the first time you ever took that journey ? yes ; it will .: 50.79
<S> if he wished to go out without gloves , his hands appeared too white ; if he wished to walk through the town , his boots seemed too highly polished .: 57.49
<S> a horse is mortal ; suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy ? d artagnan did not smile .: 78.33
<S> i don t want any supper , said caderousse .: 20.60
<S> on guard ! milady assumed the most agreeable air possible , and conversed with more than her usual brilliancy .: 58.00
<S> i was brought up in the country , and my father in his leisure time was something of a poacher . and what did he do the rest of his time ? monsieur , he carried on a trade which i have always thought satisfactory . which ? as it was a time of war between the catholics and the huguenots , and as he saw the catholics exterminate the huguenots and the huguenots exterminate the catholics all in the name of religion he adopted a mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes catholic , sometimes a huguenot .: 59.88
<S> and moreover , in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves .: 50.95
<S> even athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others , for he knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible drama then unfolded .: 60.39
<S> as for me , i shall be deceived all my life perhaps , but i shall always have faith in a person whose countenance inspires me with sympathy . you would , then , be tempted to believe , said the abbess , that this young person is innocent ? the cardinal pursues not only crimes , said she : there are certain virtues which he pursues more severely than certain offenses . permit me , madame , to express my surprise , said the abbess .: 47.95
<S> for the story ?: 60.34
<S> everyone is free to ask what he pleases . that s true , replied jacopo ; i only make a remark . well , you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers , if you have them . no , said jacopo ; but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers . that is all i want , interrupted dante s .: 30.66
<S> euge nie danglars ; i can not in conscience , therefore , let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say to me , vicomte , you know i give my daughter two millions . ah , this marriage will never take place , said beauchamp .: 43.41
<S> but mio caro did not reply .: 53.81
<S> march forward ! but eloquent as he might be , the eloquence of the grandson of henry iv .: 53.00
<S> bonacieux , what is that noise ? that of either our friends or our enemies , said milady , with her terrible coolness .: 43.75
<S> then all is agreed ? said she .: 28.71
<S> it was situated in the via dei banchi , near st. peter s .: 29.82
<S> whose is the sand upon which we were reclining ?: 121.59
<S> well , said morcerf , i may as well be magnanimous , and tear myself away to forward your wishes .: 67.32
<S> desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go , she began to tell a story , obscure at first , but very circumstantial afterward , about the cardinal , relating the amours of the minister with mme .: 81.79
<S> i shut my eyes , and i can see you as you then were ; i open them again , and i see what you are now a hundred times more beautiful ! what folly , murmured anne of austria , who had not the courage to find fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his heart , what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances ! and upon what then must i live ?: 53.98
<S> let us pursue him , and we shall overtake him ! my dear friend , said aramis , remember that he goes in an opposite direction from that in which we are going , that he has a fresh horse , and ours are fatigued , so that we shall disable our own horses without even a chance of overtaking him .: 33.97
<S> tell me , i entreat of you , who and what you are ? said he at length .: 21.61
<S> it must be done .: 13.79
<S> athos replied , always by gestures , that that was well , and indicated to grimaud , by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster , that he was to stand as sentinel .: 90.35
<S> my husband could accompany me . but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor ? you have ample proof to the contrary , if you look opposite , said the baroness , as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek .: 46.91
<S> my first duty , directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life , was to restore it to its mother ; but , in order to do so , i must have made close and careful inquiry , which would , in all probability , have led to my own apprehension ; and i clung to life , partly on my sister s account , and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance .: 70.35
<S> you can sign it . yes , yes , said caderousse ; and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge .: 32.74
<S> and driving the coadjutor s carriage ! said the queen .: 28.32
<S> speak , madame ! resumed mme .: 15.41
<S> well , then , said the gascon , take care of yourself , for i am not a bad hand at the rapier . nor i either . so much the better ; that sets my mind at rest .: 31.58
<S> here comes a young gentleman , said one of them , who seems as if he were going to join the army . how do you make that out ? inquired athos .: 23.42
<S> at this moment comminges rushed into the room .: 13.37
<S> this was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen , for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen s coachmen on a cold night , and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door .: 71.82
<S> whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk , or as a place for meditation , was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare , the cool , refreshing shade , the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun , that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer , the incessant and melodious warbling of birds , and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion .: 91.55
<S> you marry a money bag label , it is true ; well , but what does that matter ?: 101.34
<S> at court , provided you have ever the honor to go there , continued m. d artagnan the elder , an honor to which , remember , your ancient nobility gives you the right sustain worthily your name of gentleman , which has been worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years , both for your own sake and the sake of those who belong to you .: 74.88
<S> pray , are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury ? do then as i did , my lord .: 42.76
<S> the king s !: 24.52
<S> there , disguised under other names , and concealed under other costumes , are police agents , magistrates , attorneys general , and bailiffs .: 130.59
<S> in that case his last hope would have been destroyed .: 30.39
<S> no ; by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level ; we no longer talk , we rise to dissertation .: 158.81
<S> the festa was magnificent ; not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated , but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden ; and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces , and the terraces to the garden walks .: 83.36
<S> as for his wife , he bowed to her , as some husbands do to their wives , but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend , until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life .: 90.90
<S> these horrible chills , which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones , begin to pervade my whole frame ; in five minutes the malady will reach its height , and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse . oh ! exclaimed dante s , his heart wrung with anguish .: 55.25
<S> rest content with my friendship , for i say once more that is all i can promise , and i will promise no more than i can bestow . i understand , replied fernand , you can endure your own wretchedness patiently , but you are afraid to share mine .: 57.81
<S> mazarin came within three steps of d artagnan and pushed a spring in the wall ; the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place .: 67.47
<S> to you , perhaps , they will accord the time they have refused to me .: 41.32
<S> as you please ; it is ready in all ways . i will take it in the turkish style , replied franz .: 22.33
<S> all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day ; athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends poor atoms , lost in that raging whirlwind .: 81.81
<S> yes , gentlemen , in the king s room .: 14.57
<S> it is true he had been playing the day before . playing the day before !: 42.31
<S> the englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity , evidently mingled with interest .: 20.60
<S> the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil , and that he only knew what was related by the abbe busoni , who that evening , by mere chance , had requested to pass the night in his house , to examine some valuable books in his library .: 34.70
<S> but apropos of debray , how is it that i have not seen him lately at the baron s house ? there has been a misunderstanding . what , with the baroness ? no , with the baron . has he perceived anything ? ah , that is a good joke ! do you think he suspects ? said monte cristo with charming artlessness .: 35.58
<S> la ramee ! la ramee came into the room .: 15.01
<S> she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time , and saw there was a postscript .: 40.84
<S> ali reappeared .: 50.14
<S> as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto , he thought he heard a cry .: 18.66
<S> gentlemen , said the duke , i will thank you later ; now we have not a moment to lose .: 20.00
<S> the messenger was unmoved .: 28.61
<S> one went to support d artagnan , the other porthos .: 44.36
<S> the officer conversed a few instants with the captain , gave him several papers , of which he was the bearer , to read , and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel , both passengers and sailors , were called upon deck .: 64.10
<S> well , for my part , i shall go to bed , said d artagnan ; come , porthos . porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend .: 24.14
<S> the delay had been occasioned by a visit from madame danglars and euge nie , which had been prolonged beyond the time at which valentine was expected .: 36.65
<S> adieu , your excellency ; depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you . saying these words , the transteverin disappeared down the staircase , while his companion , muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle , passed almost close to franz , and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps .: 55.93
<S> but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion ; and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared , and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose .: 139.48
<S> well , this waistcoat was discovered today , covered with blood , and with a hole over the heart . the ladies screamed , and two or three prepared to faint .: 67.63
<S> lord de winter , d artagnan , athos , porthos , and aramis , went out close behind her .: 14.61
<S> poor queen ! murmured athos .: 17.90
<S> the journey soon became interesting from its rapidity , of which morcerf had formed no previous idea .: 84.23
<S> answer ! continued milady .: 29.96
<S> will you not even say you will see me again ? he asked .: 14.29
<S> you succeeded , and then god snatched it from you , and brought you to justice . it was not i who wished to kill the jew , said caderousse ; it was la carconte . yes , said monte cristo , and god , i can not say in justice , for his justice would have slain you , but god , in his mercy , spared your life . pardieu ! to transport me for life , how merciful ! you thought it a mercy then , miserable wretch !: 48.53
<S> you know not , then , anything of your birth you have never seen your mother ? yes , my lord ; she came three times , whilst i was a child , to my nurse s house ; i remember the last time she came as well as if it were to day . you have a good memory , said mazarin .: 29.29
<S> suddenly the tumult ceased , as if by magic , and the doors of the church opened .: 31.58
<S> of aramis , yes , since he has become an abbe .: 33.92
<S> you are speaking , you scoundrel ! said athos , rising upon his elbow , and transfixing grimaud with his flaming look .: 40.07
<S> the bastion saint gervais on arriving at the lodgings of his three friends , d artagnan found them assembled in the same chamber .: 29.78
<S> anne had never at the louvre had so large a court ; but this crowd represented chiefly the second class of nobility , while the prince de conti , the duc de beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around them the first nobility of france .: 60.08
<S> let them try to pursue him !: 37.21
<S> scarcely , however , had he touched edmond s hand when he felt he had done all he could do , and rushed hastily out of the house .: 24.17
<S> he hastened to descend into the street , with a frightful beating at his heart ; he wished to see if he could find other traces of violence .: 27.57
<S> there is the hullabaloo louder than ever ! d artagnan , in fact , heard a great noise on the side next the cellar .: 35.67
<S> what , you don t know me ? no , monseigneur . well , two words will refresh your memory .: 22.57
<S> patrick , let no one enter .: 55.27
<S> i did hope man is a poor wretched creature , i did hope .: 81.39
<S> gentlemen , said d artagnan , you shall have your turn .: 10.59
<S> i wrote to franz and were he here he would confirm every word i wrote then to franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six , at ten minutes past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the honor of being ; and signor luigi vampa , such was the name of the chief of these bandits , would have scrupulously kept his word . but franz did come with the four thousand crowns , said cha teau renaud .: 63.79
<S> in the first place he had made rough work of it ; one man was killed on the spot , and two others were severely wounded .: 38.94
<S> and therefore , said d artagnan , to clip the hope which athos s tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin , we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity . if on the contrary , resumed mazarin , you accept your liberty why you , my lord , might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward ; and from my knowledge of you i believe you will so take it away from us . no on the faith of a cardinal .: 54.93
<S> collect all your courage , for you have not yet heard all . ah , exclaimed madame danglars , alarmed , what is there more to hear ? you only look back to the past , and it is , indeed , bad enough .: 39.30
<S> would you like a proof of it ?: 24.80
<S> the inspector could not contend against this accusation ; he simply wrote , nothing to be done . this visit had infused new vigor into dante s ; he had , till then , forgotten the date ; but now , with a fragment of plaster , he wrote the date , 30th july , 1816 , and made a mark every day , in order not to lose his reckoning again .: 65.99
<S> five minutes later the carriage stopped , having reached cours la reine .: 34.38
<S> keep near me , said the latter .: 19.27
<S> in an instant all five were ready .: 34.40
<S> now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant , and to which you descend by another stair , an old abbe , formerly leader of a party in italy , who has been here since 1811 , and in 1813 he went mad , and the change is astonishing .: 65.17
<S> he let the jug fall on the floor , and it broke in pieces .: 22.84
<S> at last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot .: 30.39
<S> to whom is it addressed ? to monsieur noirtier , rue coq he ron , paris . had a thunderbolt fallen into the room , villefort could not have been more stupefied .: 52.43
<S> monsieur de busigny , said athos , will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine , or permit me to regulate mine by yours ? which you please , monsieur ! said the light horseman , drawing from his fob a very handsome watch , studded with diamonds ; half past seven . thirty five minutes after seven , said athos , by which you perceive i am five minutes faster than you . and bowing to all the astonished persons present , the young men took the road to the bastion st. gervais , followed by grimaud , who carried the basket , ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which athos had taught him not even thinking of asking .: 44.48
<S> he laid his sword at the head , his pistols by his side , stretched his cloak over his feet , placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw , which rustled under him .: 41.74
<S> as to d artagnan , afraid of some feint , he still stood on the defensive .: 32.01
<S> the hands were white , but without delicacy ; the feet did not bespeak the woman of quality .: 74.78
<S> the hinges yielded in their turn and fell , still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood , and the chest was open .: 53.61
<S> that s the whole story .: 17.58
<S> the several members of that group were much excited .: 78.70
<S> he has grown a good deal , it seems to me . and he sat down in the hall , choosing a conspicuous place .: 25.89
<S> yes , grandpapa , said valentine ; it is so .: 16.09
<S> bonacieux , the comtesse de winter . the four friends uttered one and the same cry , but that of athos dominated all the rest .: 39.59
<S> and as much , at least , in pearls , diamonds , and jewels , said euge nie .: 25.89
<S> if he defers he will find the place of honor taken . shall i send word to him as coming from you ? yes certainly . shall i tell him that he can count on you ? to the end . and you will leave the command to him ? of the war , yes , but in politics you must know it is not his element . he must leave me to negotiate for my cardinal s hat in my own fashion . you care about it , then , so much ? since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me , said gondy , i wish at least that the hat should be red . one must not dispute matters of taste and colors , said rochefort , laughing .: 61.62
<S> there was no one like him for that . and now , replied d artagnan , behold the sad spectacle that awaits us .: 30.36
<S> when the grave was formed , the father embraced her first , and then the lover ; afterwards , one taking the head , the other the feet , they placed her in the grave .: 56.26
<S> oh , my father , must your past career always interfere with my successes ? suddenly a light passed over his face , a smile played round his set mouth , and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought .: 55.68
<S> he felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper ; it was the letter of aramis : monsieur d artagnan : you know that i have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman , who has given me an appointment for this evening in the place royale .: 26.40
<S> p.s . i now believe in italian banditti . below these lines were written , in a strange hand , the following in italian : se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani , alla sette il conte alberto avra cessato di vivere .: 424.84
<S> you live on your estate , happy in golden mediocrity .: 113.34
<S> after all , continued d artagnan , there was certainly one with aramis .: 29.55
<S> felton , quite bewildered , almost mad , stood speechless .: 64.76
<S> the count again refused .: 24.45
<S> at that moment d artagnan passed in pursuit of milady ; he cast a passing glance at porthos , and beheld this triumphant look .: 34.11
<S> laporte pointed to the child , who was asleep .: 33.04
<S> isn t it so , kitty ? i do not care where i live , said kitty , provided i am well concealed , and nobody knows where i am . meanwhile , kitty , when we are about to separate , and you are no longer jealous of me monsieur chevalier , far off or near , said kitty , i shall always love you . where the devil will constancy niche itself next ? murmured athos .: 66.93
<S> lord de winter perceived nothing of this .: 24.17
<S> it was then albert , returning from his meeting with the count , perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain , and turned aside .: 55.83
<S> and have not all these fernands , united , made lieutenant general , the count of morcerf , peer of france ? oh , cried the general , as if branded with a hot iron , wretch , to reproach me with my shame when about , perhaps , to kill me !: 60.73
<S> with three fingers , to be sure one for the father , one for the son , and one for the holy ghost . all crossed themselves .: 57.03
<S> taste the hashish , guest of mine taste the hashish . franz s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation , about as much in quantity as his host had eaten , and lift it to his mouth .: 100.59
<S> my sister is in the garden plucking the dead roses ; my brother is reading his two papers , la presse and les de bats , within six steps of her ; for wherever you see madame herbault , you have only to look within a circle of four yards and you will find m. emmanuel , and reciprocally , as they say at the polytechnic school . at the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to five and twenty , dressed in a silk morning gown , and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rose tree , raised her head .: 73.60
<S> tell me , have you ever thought that seven times 1,700,000 francs make nearly twelve millions ?: 59.32
<S> reflect how glorious a day it will be , how grand , how solemn , that day of complete restoration , on which you will say in this very office , my father died because he could not do what i have this day done ; but he died calmly and peaceably , because in dying he knew what i should do . my father , my father ! cried the young man , why should you not live ? if i live , all would be changed ; if i live , interest would be converted into doubt , pity into hostility ; if i live i am only a man who has broken his word , failed in his engagements in fact , only a bankrupt .: 74.03
<S> now , i don t set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at tyburn or sent for change of scene to the indies .: 104.61
<S> that is i ! murmured milady , in extreme terror ; what do you want ? we wish to judge you according to your crime , said athos ; you shall be free to defend yourself .: 28.00
<S> soon a red streak became visible in the horizon , the waves whitened , a light played over them , and gilded their foaming crests with gold .: 65.87
<S> and what a coat , sir , for a prince of the cavalcanti ! the keeper turned his back , and shrugged his shoulders ; he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so ; he had heard so many utter the same things , indeed , he heard nothing else .: 43.63
<S> oh , he said , he is mad ! and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him , he rushed into the street , for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done .: 28.14
<S> d artagnan , meantime , went into the house , whistling a tune which he had begun before porthos went away .: 31.77
<S> dante s ordered the helmsman to put down his helm , in order to leave la pianosa to starboard , as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots .: 36.03
<S> he turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife : port . d art . 2d february . this is capital ! said athos to aramis , we were to have slept here , but we can not we must push on . they rode forward and reached abbeville .: 90.59
<S> he walked to the window and looked into the court .: 17.84
<S> morrel was conducted along a dark passage , which led to a little door opening on the garden , soon found the spot where he had entered , with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall , and by his ladder was in an instant in the clover field where his cabriolet was still waiting for him .: 44.49
<S> as soon as that important business is concluded , i will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame danglars . i dare not return with those dreadful horses , said madame de villefort .: 48.52
<S> that was your fault . all my oil is lost ! oil is a sovereign balm for wounds ; and my poor grimaud here was obliged to dress those you had inflicted on him . all my sausages are gnawed ! there is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar . you shall pay me for all this , cried the exasperated host .: 97.26
<S> villefort knew not when he should return , and rene e , far from pleading for dante s , hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover .: 61.12
<S> i did not even know that you were the person i was sent to fetch . impossible you a favorite of the minister ! a favorite !: 54.56
<S> i have almost given them away , as it is ; but , as i before said , i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms .: 27.23
<S> d artagnan , porthos and aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their swords .: 33.86
<S> pale , and sweetly smiling , she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance .: 64.06
<S> as to the goldsmith , he wrote to his wife , sending her the order for the thousand pistoles , and charging her to send him , in exchange , his most skillful apprentice , an assortment of diamonds , of which he gave the names and the weight , and the necessary tools .: 47.09
<S> you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard , so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly .: 65.08
<S> everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me , and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else ; it is for that reason , perhaps , that they do not quit me . they had long since passed to dessert and cigars .: 46.94
<S> has he taken off his doublet ? on the contrary , everything is in the kitchen .: 24.87
<S> full , then , of this conviction , he pulled his cap down over his eyes , and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles , he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip .: 58.45
<S> the city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon which the invited ladies were to be placed ; the city grocer had ornamented the chambers with two hundred flambeaux of white wax , a piece of luxury unheard of at that period ; and twenty violins were ordered , and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate , upon condition , said the report , that they should be played all night .: 100.62
<S> ten parts of a hundred pistoles each , in ten throws , without revenge ; in thirteen throws i had lost all in thirteen throws .: 81.46
<S> ask porthos .: 82.58
<S> it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of d artagnan , which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away .: 59.30
<S> nothing but bitter recollections . and he let his head sink upon his hands , while two large tears rolled down his cheeks .: 24.91
<S> to the tender eye of a father or a lover , the first glance would have sufficed to reveal valentine s condition ; but to this hireling , valentine only appeared to sleep .: 61.41
<S> it appeared , then , to d artagnan that m. bonacieux wore a mask , and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon .: 52.06
<S> but , asked madame danglars , looking at her husband with uneasiness , how could that prevent m. de villefort in this simple way , madame , replied monte cristo ; the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence ; i therefore sent them to the king s attorney .: 44.57
<S> can you not tell me his name ? at the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs .: 18.71
<S> do as you did before , only do not wait so long , all the springs of life are now exhausted in me , and death , he continued , looking at his paralyzed arm and leg , has but half its work to do .: 89.41
<S> you will begin , therefore , by taking me first out of paris , will you not , my dear m. d artagnan ? a difficult commission , my lord , replied d artagnan , resuming his serious manner .: 20.09
<S> heyday , madame !: 36.23
<S> at this moment planchet entered , to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at clermont .: 23.79
<S> at this moment grimaud returned , accompanied by planchet ; the latter , anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him , had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself .: 36.27
<S> on the contrary , be off , and quickly .: 36.46
<S> what do you say to it ? why , that i should think it very amusing , replied franz , if it had happened to anyone but poor albert . and , in truth , if you had not found me here , said the count , it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear ; but now , be assured , his alarm will be the only serious consequence . and shall we go and find him ? inquired franz .: 33.21
<S> you will , one or other of you , perhaps both , return it to me at paris .: 50.74
<S> the night was quiet enough .: 31.68
<S> as he said , he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her ; but the world , being round , has many ends , so that he did not know which way to turn .: 42.65
<S> can you see the air you breathe , and yet without which you could not for a moment exist ? then we do not see those beings to whom you allude ? yes , we do ; you see them whenever god pleases to allow them to assume a material form .: 73.30
<S> shall i give you the change , my officer ? said the host .: 18.46
<S> we say almost , for the idea that a young , handsome , kind , and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love , but on the contrary strengthens it .: 52.06
<S> no , mother ; from this moment i have done with the past , and accept nothing from it not even a name , because you can understand that your son can not bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another . albert , my child , said merce de s , if i had a stronger heart , that is the counsel i would have given you ; your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak ; listen to its dictates .: 42.19
<S> mademoiselle , said he , you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmother s room , will you allow me the honor of a few minutes conversation with m. noirtier ? that is it , said the old man s eye .: 25.62
<S> merce de s drew near , and plucked the fruit .: 27.23
<S> villefort had never been so concise and eloquent .: 50.16
<S> athos , after making sure that lord winter was really dead , let fall the corpse and said : come , aramis , now for the honor of france ! and the two englishmen who were nearest to them fell , mortally wounded .: 56.72
<S> his sight was dimmed , his legs sank under him , and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him .: 46.04
<S> d artagnan alone was calm , at least in appearance .: 34.01
<S> and remember , moreover , that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife , absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world .: 58.31
<S> she heard him enter , but she did not raise her head .: 20.56
<S> when they arrived at the antechamber , above the door was visible a shield , which , by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture , indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon .: 51.98
<S> suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it ? ah !: 40.98
<S> as d artagnan had foreseen , athos was not within .: 28.54
<S> this probability afforded him his first consolation .: 121.89
<S> tell them to order number 25 to come downstairs . the unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased , as he crossed the threshold , to be a man he became a number .: 127.00
<S> d artagnan , reflecting on his future amours , addressing himself to the beautiful night , and smiling at the stars , ascended the rue cherish midi , or chase midi , as it was then called .: 54.12
<S> now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening , as when he has completely disappeared .: 137.73
<S> pardieu , monsieur ! said athos , that s a proposition that pleases me ; not that i can accept it , but a league off it savors of the gentleman .: 41.99
<S> it is unnecessary to state that , in the eyes of the young man , valentine did not suffer by the contrast .: 24.56
<S> do you intend opening the door ? said the baroness .: 14.47
<S> he was thunderstruck .: 18.06
<S> and yet this nature so distinguished , this creature so beautiful , this essence so fine , was seen to turn insensibly toward material life , as old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility .: 172.84
<S> he only changed his sword hand , and fought with his left hand .: 30.42
<S> oh , my brother does not allude to its value , although it has been estimated at 100,000 francs ; he means , that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel i spoke of just now . this i do not comprehend ; and yet i may not ask for an explanation , madame , replied monte cristo bowing .: 51.24
<S> the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray .: 47.23
<S> if i believed that , i would place my arm under yours and go with you to marseilles , leaving the house to return to it no more . fernand s eye darted lightning .: 61.16
<S> d avrigny , cried villefort , i can not tell you all i feel at this moment , terror , grief , madness . yes , said m. d avrigny , with an imposing calmness , but i think it is now time to act .: 26.45
<S> then she retired so gently that valentine did not know she had left the room .: 30.13
<S> this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that , instead of being the result of the power of his will , it might emanate from enfeebled organs .: 45.91
<S> albert , besides being an elegant , well looking young man , was also possessed of considerable talent and ability ; moreover , he was a viscount a recently created one , certainly , but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent , and a genealogical tree is equally estimated , whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815 ; but to crown all these advantages , albert de morcerf commanded an income of 50,000 livres , a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris .: 100.88
<S> the president requested her to throw aside her veil , and it was then seen that she was dressed in the grecian costume , and was remarkably beautiful . ah , said albert , it was she . who ? hayde e. who told you that ? alas , i guess it .: 41.47
<S> nevertheless , had caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer , he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of bellegarde ; as the moving object drew nearer , he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse , between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist .: 84.39
<S> he was a relentless enemy , that damned cardinal , continued aramis , glancing at the portrait of the old minister .: 41.08
<S> upon his return to hayde e he found her still very pale .: 28.97
<S> and now , my young friend , for you will permit me , i hope , to give you that name , said lord de winter , on this very evening , if agreeable to you , i will present you to my sister , milady clarik , for i am desirous that she should take you into her good graces ; and as she is not in bad odor at court , she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that will not prove useless to you . d artagnan blushed with pleasure , and bowed a sign of assent .: 38.07
<S> now sir , said madame de villefort , i must bid you farewell .: 24.66
<S> so pray keep your places , like athos , whose calmness is entirely laudable .: 131.91
<S> as soon as we are married , he shall come and live with us , instead of one child , he shall have two .: 32.18
<S> the little troop , without looking behind them or exchanging a word , fled at a rapid gallop , fording a little stream , of which none of them knew the name , and leaving on their left a town which athos declared to be durham .: 56.58
<S> the boy triumphed , and this victory rendered him so audacious , that all the money of assunta , whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it , was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against , and follies she had not the courage to prevent .: 74.67
<S> i should be carried home in triumph like monsieur broussel and athos would proclaim me the french brutus .: 107.87
<S> madame de villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles .: 20.85
<S> it is you , mordaunt , he said .: 12.81
<S> may i presume to ask whether you have long possessed it ? it has been in the family a very long while , returned monte cristo , a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years , during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital .: 64.15
<S> an enemy in my house , do you say , edmond !: 31.36
<S> yes , said albert , but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo . pardieu ! everyone exists . doubtless , but not in the same way ; everyone has not black slaves , a princely retinue , an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress , horses that cost six thousand francs apiece , and greek mistresses . have you seen the greek mistress ? i have both seen and heard her .: 60.12
<S> it appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow , as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their leaves .: 98.60
<S> may i reckon on you as an auxiliary ? d artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach .: 77.06
<S> i m beginning to feel queer ! cried blaisois .: 62.52
<S> well ? said porthos .: 8.84
<S> enchanted , monsieur , said mazarin , venturing his head out of one of the windows ; and now do as much for the queen . it will not be so difficult , replied d artagnan , springing to the ground .: 24.41
<S> you will know that to morrow evening , said the coadjutor , smiling .: 21.69
<S> he came , hoping that i would accept my shame , as my shame was consummated ; he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my love .: 69.19
<S> now what is vague is doubtful ; and it was a wise man who said , when in doubt , keep out . meaning to say , rejoined monte cristo , that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly , the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example . not at all . plainly enough ; messrs. thomson french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m. danglars have their limits ; he is a wise man , according to his own showing . monsieur , replied the banker , drawing himself up with a haughty air , the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned . it seems , then , reserved for me , said monte cristo coldly , to be the first to do so . by what right , sir ? by right of the objections you have raised , and the explanations you have demanded , which certainly must have some motive . once more danglars bit his lips .: 66.49
<S> do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if i do not make it , although i have repeated more than once , and affirmed on my honor , that i was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me , and although i still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the count of morcerf under the name of fernand ? i maintain my original resolution . very well , my dear sir ; then i consent to cut throats with you .: 43.63
<S> this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that d artagnan s adversary , while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows , sheathed his sword with the same precision , and instead of an actor , which he had nearly been , became a spectator of the fight a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness , muttering , nevertheless , a plague upon these gascons !: 70.18
<S> aramis bit his lips till the blood came .: 39.42
<S> i thank you , madame , said he , for the deference you have shown to my wishes , but i think you want two of the studs , and i bring them back to you . with these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had given him .: 24.44
<S> if you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question , i believe there is nothing to say against him , and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty . but tell me , dante s , if you had command of the pharaon should you be glad to see danglars remain ? captain or mate , m. morrel , i shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners confidence . that s right , that s right , dante s !: 41.59
<S> from eight in the evening until six in the morning come in by the window . adieu , dear friend . oh , i can t let you go so !: 49.98
<S> our readers already know how he was recognized by d artagnan , and how that recognition by inspiring fear in the four musketeers had given fresh activity to their journey .: 81.91
<S> at last it became aramis s turn , who performed it with a good grace and who succeeded as he said , by selling some theological books in procuring a few pistoles .: 57.56
<S> the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on .: 15.22
<S> from the depth of my heart , said gondy .: 22.94
<S> this secret which he possessed , this woman whom he loved !: 61.21
<S> well , those studs , continued mme .: 36.67
<S> the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700,000 francs in the course of an hour . i do not understand you , sir , said the baroness , trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face .: 23.57
<S> lord , how i have eaten ! m. coquenard had eaten his soup , the black feet of the fowl , and the only mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of meat .: 68.38
<S> andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself , and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long .: 45.83
<S> was killed . but what has this vision of henry iv .: 58.44
<S> thus a new , a stronger , and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes .: 101.03
<S> in fact , ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the king s closet opened , and m. de tre ville saw m. de la tre mouille come out .: 18.48
<S> if she dislikes that so much , why did she ever marry herself ? you do not understand me , maximilian .: 34.20
<S> come , caderousse , no nonsense ! said he .: 18.87
<S> frequenting the cafe de paris , the boulevard de gand , and the bois de boulogne , during his brief career of splendor , the false cavalcanti had formed a host of acquaintances .: 54.31
<S> friquet , seeing this fine officer thus walk away , followed by two guards , amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage .: 107.09
<S> who is he ? come , come , you won t tell me you don t know aramis ? this is the first time i ever heard his name pronounced . it is the first time , then , that you ever went to that house ? undoubtedly . and you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man ? no . by a musketeer ? no , indeed ! it was not he , then , you came to seek ? not the least in the world .: 25.29
<S> gracious heavens ! exclaimed dante s , what is the matter ?: 11.83
<S> the count felt his heart beat more rapidly .: 34.19
<S> and make la ramee eat the pear , answered grimaud .: 71.75
<S> i am waiting until you send him to speak at the luxembourg , to laugh at my ease . my dear friend , said albert to beauchamp , it is plain that the affairs of spain are settled , for you are most desperately out of humor this morning .: 40.38
<S> don t let us talk politics , my lord . then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him , and i should have news from those without the prison walls . ah , yes !: 46.05
<S> the other was a large square epistle , resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal duke .: 47.80
<S> then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down , crept from behind the drapery , glided between two horses , mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn .: 55.89
<S> he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo , skirt the outer wall , and re enter by the porta san giovanni ; thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol , the forum , the arch of septimus severus , the temple of antoninus and faustina , and the via sacra .: 57.61
<S> why did you give him six pistoles ? you told me to give them to him . it is true ; i am too good natured .: 26.02
<S> for the last time , where are you going ? to the devil ! answered d artagnan .: 12.64
<S> but what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language .: 109.27
<S> fortunately , dante s had learned how to wait ; he had waited fourteen years for his liberty , and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth .: 48.54
<S> my private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side . good ! thought d artagnan : in this direction i am satisfied . he pressed aramis s hand and went in search of porthos .: 55.22
<S> take the stairs on your right ; go up the first flight and knock at number one .: 77.65
<S> this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music , produced not the slightest effect on the two young men , who continued their conversation .: 29.30
<S> inform this dear friend that he may remain within , that i shall go and see him immediately . sir , i obey with pleasure , if her majesty will permit me to depart . go , monsieur de bragelonne , said the queen , and rest assured of our affection . raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses , and bowing to de winter , departed .: 47.32
<S> ay , and observe it just occurs to me that the puritans are furious against buckingham , and their preachers designate him as the antichrist . well ? said milady .: 82.44
<S> ah , you are a cardinalist , then , monsieur , are you ? cried she ; and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen ? private interests are as nothing before the interests of all .: 59.91
<S> i had a betrothed , albert , a lovely girl whom i adored , and i was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis , painfully amassed by ceaseless toil .: 56.36
<S> happily , d artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties .: 30.08
<S> but this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man , and was succeeded by a still greater grief .: 79.01
<S> then , said she , he has well played his part . who has ? he who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the cardinal . it was , then , a part he was playing ? yes , my child . that man , then , was not that man , said milady , lowering her voice , is my brother . your brother ! cried mme .: 37.23
<S> that great man who was so revered by d artagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the musketeers of tre ville , who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back .: 69.64
<S> when he learned my resolution , i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me , and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks .: 68.16
<S> monte cristo shuddered , and arose .: 18.56
<S> dust i am , and to dust i return .: 129.61
<S> when he came up again the light had disappeared .: 31.40
<S> at eccuis , the same scene was repeated .: 48.37
<S> i have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded .: 48.12
<S> what is this ? wait , your reverence , there is a letter . you know i have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier i will break every bone in your body .: 43.64
<S> we hope so , answered the curates .: 33.64
<S> he remained in his cell , and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity .: 39.82
<S> besides , the end justified the means , as you frenchmen say , does it not ? yes , my lord , i accept them , said d artagnan ; and if it please god , we will make a good use of your presents . well , now , your hand , young man .: 34.09
<S> at the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination , the cardinal was satisfied .: 24.10
<S> to be sure , yes .: 28.83
<S> how many guns , gentlemen ? twelve , replied aramis .: 40.39
<S> he again struck it , and with greater force .: 30.05
<S> as to porthos , his barony was perhaps dependent on that affair .: 45.15
<S> ah , said andrea , when may we hope for that pleasure ? on saturday , if you will yes . let me see saturday i am to dine at my country house , at auteuil , on that day , rue de la fontaine , no .: 36.92
<S> bear witness that we have done all that we could . that shall be testified to , rest assured .: 109.63
<S> i command you not to stir attempt nothing , not to let your countenance betray a thought , and i will send you tidings .: 83.96
<S> with a single glance villefort s eye ran through the room .: 24.86
<S> light me , m. bertuccio , and go first ; we will see where it leads to . monsieur , replied bertuccio , it leads to the garden . and , pray , how do you know that ? it ought to do so , at least . well , let us be sure of that . bertuccio sighed , and went on first ; the stairs did , indeed , lead to the garden .: 29.27
<S> this man was cromwell .: 24.13
<S> i will complain to monsieur de tre ville , and monsieur de tre ville will complain to the king . he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host , who accompanied him , cap in hand , to the gate , and remounted his yellow horse , which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st. antoine at paris , where his owner sold him for three crowns , which was a very good price , considering that d artagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage .: 38.65
<S> well , pardieu ! said aramis , it was only this : i had a dream , and i related it to her . yez , yez , said the swiss ; it s simple enough to dell a dream , but i neffer dream . you are very fortunate , said athos , rising ; i wish i could say as much ! neffer , replied the swiss , enchanted that a man like athos could envy him anything .: 44.45
<S> his heart failed him .: 28.18
<S> thank god you have come ! eh !: 54.13
<S> d artagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself , and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table .: 53.12
<S> why do you not apply to them , if you stand in need of help ? that is to say , stammered milady , i am not really very intimate with any of them .: 26.37
<S> from the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them .: 34.66
<S> when he reappeared , athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on d artagnan , but a more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face .: 54.03
<S> now we are on the very road which all the vessels between dover and calais take , tis impossible but that we should meet with a fisherman who will pick us up . but should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north ? that , said athos , would be quite another thing ; and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the atlantic . which implies that we may die of hunger , said aramis .: 69.15
<S> excuse me , mr. president , he said , in a clear voice , but i see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which i can not follow you .: 27.70
<S> the monks had no longer an instant of repose .: 32.56
<S> there are in this bag three hundred pistoles .: 42.41
<S> morbleu , said athos , as soon as they were again in motion , reduced to two masters and grimaud and planchet !: 56.33
<S> i am too well aware that though a subordinate , like myself , is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs , there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else . tis well , danglars tis well ! replied m. morrel .: 74.52
<S> after his wife the banker descended , as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage .: 45.41
<S> a laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour .: 81.68
<S> they set out ; after a run of two leagues , mousqueton s horse sank .: 62.58
<S> yes ; but in order to avenge herself she must be free .: 29.28
<S> it was at this moment d artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace , in the coadjutor s carriage , and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them .: 23.87
<S> i dressed myself as quickly as possible ; my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated .: 83.13
<S> the count had just opened a door .: 11.53
<S> there was no more to be had in saint germain .: 20.99
<S> thus the house had become unrecognizable , and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it , encircled as it was by a framework of trees .: 62.37
<S> these two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet de chambre , who opened the door of the vestibule , then another which seemed to be that of a waiting room , and showing them two stools : your orders are very simple , he said ; don t allow anybody , except one person , to enter here .: 55.15
<S> it may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this discovery .: 38.03
<S> first one gun l goes under , then the other .: 159.28
<S> well , well ! said he .: 9.60
<S> there were nobles , who made war against each other ; there was the king , who made war against the cardinal ; there was spain , which made war against the king .: 42.76
<S> there could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal .: 22.62
<S> 16 the god of fruitfulness in grecian mythology .: 158.59
<S> like a genuine frenchman , albert had employed his time in arranging for the evening s diversion ; he had sent to engage a box at the teatro argentina ; and franz , having a number of letters to write , relinquished the carriage to albert for the whole of the day .: 52.93
<S> oh , i am dying !: 9.88
<S> if a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker s feet , he could not have experienced greater terror .: 32.93
<S> at the other end , silent , scarcely visible , and like a shadow , was a sentinel , who was walking up and down before a grotto , which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere .: 43.03
<S> that is your road , excellency , and now you can not again mistake . and here is your recompense , said the traveller , offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money .: 39.86
<S> great god , she is losing her senses ! while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice , aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water ; but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of athos , who , standing before the table , his hair rising from his head , his eyes fixed in stupor , was looking at one of the glasses , and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt .: 39.91
<S> now , said he , i m off to the bishop s .: 22.63
<S> taste this , and in an hour you will be a king , not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of europe like france , spain , or england , but king of the world , king of the universe , king of creation ; without bowing at the feet of satan , you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth .: 54.05
<S> we stepped into the boat .: 24.22
<S> now , sir , said the count , you are safe calm yourself . ah !: 15.22
<S> there was an impressive silence ; morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency .: 76.97
<S> six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt ; he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to cromwell , when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen s apartments .: 61.59
<S> thirty strides brought them to dry land ; the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet , and looked around for someone to show him his road , for it was quite dark .: 60.00
<S> all went well till they arrived at chantilly , which they reached about eight o clock in the morning .: 24.28
<S> yes , if i die ! well , valentine , resumed maximilian , i can only say again that you are right .: 19.52
<S> at the letter s the old man stopped her .: 34.39
<S> i ve remarked that your puritans revel in that color . but can you find your man ? said aramis to athos .: 71.57
<S> i am only annoyed about a bankrupt of trieste . really ?: 90.16
<S> are you satisfied , my lord ? he asked .: 7.09
<S> that is more than time enough for us to devise a plan .: 52.56
<S> i trust all this will soon be taken away . bertuccio bowed .: 24.61
<S> no , happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father s actions .: 158.90
<S> the fact was , that andrea , at war with society ever since his youth , was quite as deep as a gendarme , even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier , and quite prepared for the fire , he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney pots .: 71.43
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> the council of the musketeers as athos had foreseen , the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses , french and rochellais .: 48.12
<S> anne of austria , deprived of the confidence of her husband , pursued by the hatred of the cardinal , who could not pardon her for having repulsed a more tender feeling , having before her eyes the example of the queen mother whom that hatred had tormented all her life though marie de me dicis , if the memoirs of the time are to be believed , had begun by according to the cardinal that sentiment which anne of austria always refused him anne of austria had seen her most devoted servants fall around her , her most intimate confidants , her dearest favorites .: 58.13
<S> it is sufficient , count , he said , and signed the treaty .: 18.77
<S> it is now three years , madame , since i saw you for the first time , and during those three years i have loved you thus .: 20.04
<S> it is not just that he should despise me so , without any reason .: 32.39
<S> an old acquaintance , replied grimaud .: 30.81
<S> i will give it to none but the king , monsieur , said anne .: 23.80
<S> but neither of these two wounds was serious , and they only fought more earnestly .: 61.11
<S> d artagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage , but the young king stretched out his arm , saying : no , sir !: 27.54
<S> we are now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of heaven ; we are the poor , succored by god . but why not address yourself to your sister , the queen ? asked the girl .: 35.48
<S> the dappled grays the baron , followed by the count , traversed a long series of apartments , in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth , until he reached the boudoir of madame danglars a small octagonal shaped room , hung with pink satin , covered with white indian muslin .: 62.58
<S> and i see you playing with the pommel of your sword , as if you had a great inclination to break the holy father s head . yes , count , it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you , but i feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man .: 38.18
<S> athos called grimaud , pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner , and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins .: 28.68
<S> it was said athos had met with great crosses in love , and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant man .: 55.84
<S> oh , yes , and with all my heart ; for i know what it is to be in love . you know what it is to be in love ? said d artagnan , looking at her for the first time with much attention .: 15.19
<S> the court of his ho tel , situated in the rue du vieux colombier , resembled a camp from by six o clock in the morning in summer and eight o clock in winter .: 21.56
<S> escape chapter lix .: 77.48
<S> all at once he raised his head ; his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution ; he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten , and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him , he shrilled it twice .: 40.58
<S> what would you have , my dear viscount ? said monte cristo , wiping his hands on the towel which ali had brought him ; i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other .: 34.72
<S> yes . her hand ! exclaimed everyone .: 62.30
<S> at last raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal , and in a second he was on his feet again .: 57.09
<S> he had been contented , for the convenience of the house , to lodge in the fourth story ; and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof .: 65.52
<S> and being a musketeer but for a time , i only fight when i am forced to do so , and always with great repugnance ; but this time the affair is serious , for here is a lady compromised by you . by us , you mean ! cried d artagnan .: 41.29
<S> spy , cried the duke , more and more enraged , i will strangle you with my own hands . and he extended his hands toward grimaud , who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him .: 34.38
<S> tis like a duel .: 51.12
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> cha teau renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coupe , joined him ; beauchamp did the same .: 46.54
<S> two royal pages were playing with him .: 79.74
<S> ; i i detest , i loathe it ! very fine , anne .: 145.36
<S> monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent .: 7.64
<S> their return was cheerful .: 49.82
<S> bonacieux ; that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion , and not in the pavilion ; that she might have been detained in paris by her duties , or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband .: 28.55
<S> i know not whether he is still my friend , but since that time i have remained his . and these men are in france , my lord ? i believe so . tell me their names ; perhaps i may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them . one of them was called the chevalier d artagnan . ah , my lord , if i mistake not , the chevalier d artagnan is lieutenant of royal guards ; but take care , for i fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal . that would be a misfortune , said de winter , and i shall begin to think that we are really doomed . but the others , said the queen , who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his vessel .: 33.66
<S> poor dear monsieur d artagnan , said kitty , in a voice full of compassion , and pressing anew the young man s hand .: 19.69
<S> need we think of that since we are to save the king ?: 61.25
<S> m. bonacieux , who was ignorant that d artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung , related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster , m. de laffemas , whom he never ceased to designate , during his account , by the title of the cardinal s executioner , and expatiated at great length upon the bastille , the bolts , the wickets , the dungeons , the gratings , the instruments of torture .: 47.08
<S> a slight oscillation showed dante s that all went well .: 78.95
<S> he took back the ring , but put it in his pocket and not on his finger .: 23.50
<S> we shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her , plunged in an abyss of dismal reflection a dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind , because for the first time she doubts , for the first time she fears .: 70.73
<S> this is the order , he said .: 13.32
<S> but , alas , i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security ; i trust we shall never find it so in our experience ! oh , cried morrel , almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine , and to adore them as two superior beings , what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness ? until that time , continued the young girl in a calm and self possessed tone of voice , we will conform to circumstances , and be guided by the wishes of our friends , so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us ; in a word , and i repeat it , because it expresses all i wish to convey , we will wait . and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes , sir , said morrel , not only with resignation , but with cheerfulness . therefore , continued valentine , looking playfully at maximilian , no more inconsiderate actions no more rash projects ; for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined , honorably and happily , to bear your name ? morrel looked obedience to her commands .: 92.93
<S> cahusac immediately ran to the guardsman whom aramis had killed , seized his rapier , and returned toward d artagnan ; but on his way he met athos , who during his relief which d artagnan had procured him had recovered his breath , and who , for fear that d artagnan would kill his enemy , wished to resume the fight .: 51.82
<S> it is late , and the governor is asleep .: 33.79
<S> they both mingled , as they had leave to do , with the servants and peasants .: 51.84
<S> it is god himself who sent us here . yes , said porthos , let us break the door in and fall upon him . no , replied d artagnan , no noise .: 32.01
<S> listen , said the young man to the sentinel .: 13.99
<S> he was occupied with the preparations for raoul s departure and was seeking to gain time .: 30.54
<S> aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head .: 18.32
<S> in the name of the queen i forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your journey . and do you command nothing in your own name ? in my name , said mme .: 36.59
<S> he remained there all night , not knowing where he was .: 48.35
<S> there is no one but myself can so execute them that one can not tell the new from the old . therefore , my dear mr. o reilly , you are my prisoner .: 66.12
<S> when , sir , i tell you all this with tears of heartfelt anguish , can you reply that i am wrong , can you prevent my putting an end to my miserable existence ?: 55.60
<S> he went then to the queen , and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her .: 55.35
<S> if you are attacked by day or by night , fight , but retreat , without shame ; if you cross a bridge , feel every plank of it with your foot , lest one should give way beneath you ; if you pass before a house which is being built , look up , for fear a stone should fall upon your head ; if you stay out late , be always followed by your lackey , and let your lackey be armed if , by the by , you can be sure of your lackey .: 84.64
<S> as grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea table ; he took it up , and as he took it he made a low bow .: 35.27
<S> a man bringing a letter from oliver cromwell ? said mazarin .: 39.36
<S> what did he say to me ?: 10.66
<S> should dante s not return , merce de s might one day be his .: 62.05
<S> but if you think the king s life is not worth what it must cost there s an end of the matter and i send to groslow to say i am ill. no , you are right , said athos .: 46.37
<S> here are ten thousand more francs , he said , with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket , they will make twenty five thousand .: 50.65
<S> at the door of her apartment the baroness met mademoiselle corne lie , her confidential maid .: 31.49
<S> why the devil !: 12.67
<S> death is depicted on his face !: 73.51
<S> i can not reconcile myself to this idea it would madden me .: 40.26
<S> the day before franz had been presented to madame de saint me ran , who had left her bed to receive him , but had been obliged to return to it immediately after .: 21.53
<S> help me ! here i am , sir ! said athos , leaning and stretching out his arm to mordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him ; here i am , take my hand and jump into our boat . mordaunt made a last effort rose seized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of despair .: 44.32
<S> at a quarter to ten , a valet entered ; he composed , with a little groom named john , and who only spoke english , all albert s establishment , although the cook of the hotel was always at his service , and on great occasions the count s chasseur also .: 73.41
<S> finish , mouston , finish the work ! cried porthos .: 38.21
<S> there was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill will towards me .: 72.41
<S> therefore kitty surrendered .: 187.23
<S> valentine then took the dictionary , and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages .: 39.31
<S> the brigadier , calm and dignified as the law he represented , passed through the crowd , without answering the thousand questions addressed to him , and re entered the hotel .: 39.33
<S> he knew that there was a trap door communicating with a cellar , from which one could get into the orchard .: 46.03
<S> d artagnan rushed out of the room .: 7.65
<S> the mother was a wretch , who struck at us all and at those dear to us . yes , but the son has done us no harm . grimaud , who had risen to watch the effect of the shot , fell back hopeless , wringing his hands .: 66.61
<S> ah ! said d artagnan .: 5.01
<S> this garden has never been a cemetery . what is done to infanticides in this country ? asked major cavalcanti innocently .: 66.50
<S> then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her flight . absolutely , monseigneur ; but she has most likely returned to the louvre . at one o clock this morning she had not returned . my god !: 34.90
<S> the queen breathed more freely .: 34.36
<S> he again struck his pickaxe into the earth , and encountered the same resistance , but not the same sound .: 38.37
<S> his delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip ; he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell , and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency .: 108.29
<S> what could this treachery be ?: 46.83
<S> the life of the four young men had become fraternal .: 21.87
<S> i have not a penny about me . you forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms . which ? that which i found at your feet , and replaced in your pocket . hold your tongue , imprudent man !: 51.73
<S> ah , that s it ! he cried , you have your promotion and i my barony . we are going to fetch our brevets , said d artagnan , and when we come back , master mazarin will sign them . and where are we going ? asked porthos .: 24.09
<S> my friend , monsieur du vallon , is of a very melancholy disposition , so much so , that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day .: 34.65
<S> the king took it with a trembling hand , looked for the address , which was wanting , became very pale , opened it slowly , then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the king of spain , he read it rapidly .: 35.32
<S> the treasure will be no more mine than yours , and neither of us will quit this prison .: 49.81
<S> every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent pistache .: 70.22
<S> in five minutes three were slightly wounded , one on the hand , another on the ear , by the defender of the stair , who himself remained intact a piece of skill which was worth to him , according to the rules agreed upon , three turns of favor .: 77.16
<S> you at least will be faithful to me , arthur . the horse , as if it understood these words , bent its red nostrils toward the king s face , and parting his lips displayed all its teeth , as if with pleasure .: 69.59
<S> they had only halberds before , now they have muskets .: 115.67
<S> tell us news of yourself as often as you can ; that is to say , as often as you can with safety .: 30.78
<S> in consequence , after having traveled all night , at seven o clock she was at the fort of the point ; at eight o clock she had embarked ; and at nine , the vessel , which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for bayonne , raised anchor , and steered its course toward england .: 43.63
<S> you only know that this money exists .: 61.33
<S> why should an exception be made in her favor ? i thought that my entreaties what right have you , any more than the rest , to ask for an exception ? it is true . but never mind , continued cucumetto , laughing , sooner or later your turn will come . carlini s teeth clenched convulsively .: 67.08
<S> doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character .: 64.84
<S> the man is tired , said the captain , conduct him to his bed . oh , murmured danglars , that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall , and the sleep i shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards i see glistening in the darkness . from their beds of dried leaves or wolf skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading c sar s commentaries , and by danglars studying the life of alexander .: 69.94
<S> after a moment s interval , cocles appeared .: 23.49
<S> when there is some idea of being resuscitated , you say he s a scoundrel , an impudent fellow , a miser , a bad master !: 69.52
<S> now , valentine , i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse , and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him . my dear maximilian , you are really too fanciful ; you will not love even me long .: 41.17
<S> he was not bound , nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him ; this seemed a good augury .: 62.13
<S> what , then , is to become of royalty ? the queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question .: 73.21
<S> monsieur ! said d artagnan , i beg you will have a care what you say ; for if you utter another word like that , be you marquis , duke , prince or king , i will thrust it down your throat !: 50.76
<S> respect to fallen majesty .: 117.53
<S> he then set himself to work to count his fortune .: 62.14
<S> listen , sir .: 17.06
<S> the englishman entered , and found morrel seated at a table , turning over the formidable columns of his ledger , which contained the list of his liabilities .: 34.56
<S> bonacieux hesitated to continue .: 48.97
<S> they left the chamber at the same time .: 13.37
<S> my dear d artagnan , said he , if you please , we will join our friends ; as i am rich , we will today begin to dine together again , expecting that you will be rich in your turn . my faith ! said d artagnan , with great pleasure .: 18.93
<S> the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask ; but notwithstanding this precaution , which was in fact taken rather against others than against him , he at once recognized his usual guide , the light and intelligent mme .: 50.56
<S> in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts , and children at play .: 157.57
<S> it is by his courage , please observe , by his courage alone , that a gentleman can make his way nowadays .: 63.91
<S> she should certainly return from her exile she did not doubt that a single instant ; but how long might this exile last ?: 109.43
<S> ah , a thousand thanks , count , for not having forgotten your promise . and the young officer shook the count s hand so warmly , that monte cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy , and he saw that he had been expected with impatience , and was received with pleasure .: 38.12
<S> villefort looked disdainfully at morrel , and replied coldly : you are aware , monsieur , that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life , and the best seaman in the merchant service , and yet be , politically speaking , a great criminal .: 75.16
<S> she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw , then , uttering a faint cry , threw herself back in her seat .: 42.41
<S> a very imposing escort awaited them without the gates .: 127.60
<S> but , also , said mazarin , you must understand that if i ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful . is it still only an intention , your eminence ? asked d artagnan .: 30.04
<S> lucien debray is an old friend of ours , and private secretary to the minister of the interior .: 37.57
<S> he was a stout man , of about two or three and twenty , with an open , ingenuous countenance , a black , mild eye , and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach .: 41.47
<S> come then , and take a turn with me and i will explain . the hostess , who knew d artagnan s skill with the sword , began to weep and tear her hair .: 38.28
<S> now , if you have them . andrea took five and twenty louis from his pocket .: 35.12
<S> he swam to the cap , placed it on his head , seized one of the timbers , and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking .: 50.74
<S> maximilian tried to speak , but he could articulate nothing ; he staggered , and supported himself against the wainscot .: 34.67
<S> it is magnetism , she says , and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen , she assures me .: 63.47
<S> rinse the glasses , said grimaud .: 43.41
<S> and they walked on again .: 24.66
<S> yet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman .: 133.60
<S> and i , too , added aramis .: 9.02
<S> when the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the secretaries , it became necessary , whatever hesitation he might experience it became necessary , i say , to come to the conclusion of the affair ; that is to say , to search the queen herself .: 58.63
<S> the following sentence , with active links to , or other immediate access to , the full project gutenberg license must appear prominently whenever any copy of a project gutenberg work any work on which the phrase project gutenberg appears , or with which the phrase project gutenberg is associated is accessed , displayed , performed , viewed , copied or distributed : this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the united states and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever .: 27.25
<S> a folded paper fell from edward s breast .: 43.40
<S> and who is the judas who has concluded this infamous bargain ? lord leven . are you certain of it , sir ? i heard it with my own ears . the king sighed deeply , as if his heart would break , and then buried his face in his hands .: 33.53
<S> i m certain of it ; were it not for that , i should thank you , for you have worked for us .: 32.96
<S> then , in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with , he directed his steps , for the last time , toward the residences of his three friends .: 23.27
<S> groslow ! said aramis ; the devil !: 27.19
<S> m. noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the king s attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter , and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine , which we have just detailed .: 28.15
<S> albert attributed to franz s absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask .: 67.82
<S> she allowed , therefore , half an hour to pass away ; and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle , as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the waves that immense breaking of the ocean with her pure , harmonious , and powerful voice , she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans : thou leavest thy servants , lord , to see if they be strong ; but soon thou dost afford thy hand to lead them on . these verses were not excellent very far from it ; but as it is well known , the puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry .: 85.30
<S> dante s is a good fellow ; i like dante s .: 22.08
<S> that is agreed upon .: 43.58
<S> i knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman .: 55.05
<S> as the distance increased between the travellers and paris , almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count ; he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land .: 96.44
<S> the silence became almost painful when , by a violent effort , tearing himself from his pleasing reverie : madame , said he at length , i pray you to excuse my emotion , which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness i meet here ; but contentment is so new a sight to me , that i could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband . we are very happy , monsieur , replied julie ; but we have also known unhappiness , and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves . the count s features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity .: 57.86
<S> ventre saint gris , monsieur de tre ville , as the king my father would have said .: 36.97
<S> come with me , then .: 15.65
<S> forward ! cried d artagnan , and spur for your dear lives ! they galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning , namely , in the direction toward scotland .: 51.68
<S> good !: 24.94
<S> one night , twenty years ago , my master fetched you from bethune and conducted you to armentieres . i know you well now , said the executioner ; you were one of the four grooms . just so . where do you come from now ? i was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse .: 55.49
<S> jealousy , fury , offended pride , all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an outraged woman in love , urged her to make a revelation ; but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination , and above all , that d artagnan would also be lost to her forever .: 58.58
<S> ah , what a dreadful thing , said the young musician ; who would have suspected it ?: 31.18
<S> so that he told me , that poor monsieur maillard , go find the coadjutor , friquet , and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir . say , then , father bazin the heir of monsieur maillard , the giver of holy water at saint eustache !: 58.93
<S> he glanced around , looked in the bed , shook the curtains , opened the closets , and finally stopped at the chimney .: 40.85
<S> the king was already sanguine , but when he perceived aramis his hope turned to joy .: 72.43
<S> what an idea !: 28.90
<S> thus , the greater number of a man s errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity ; then , after error has been committed in a moment of excitement , of delirium , or of fear , we see that we might have avoided and escaped it .: 69.29
<S> edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths .: 54.85
<S> i should like to offer him a last salute .: 39.33
<S> our bark flew before the wind .: 69.41
<S> how much have you left of your hundred pistoles , d artagnan ? of my hundred pistoles ?: 34.50
<S> if anything yet remains of that great , that sublime king , henry , of whom you have just spoken , he would be much surprised at so little pity for his family being united to such a profound admiration of himself . the perspiration stood in large drops on mazarin s brow .: 80.35
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> speak , speak ! said valentine ; i entreat you . has your resolution changed , valentine ? it can not change , unhappy man ; you know it must not ! cried the young girl .: 32.46
<S> monsieur mordaunt !: 28.00
<S> these conditions being agreed to , porthos took leave of mme .: 47.41
<S> yes ; but i am expecting some one , a friend of athos . a friend ! exclaimed the count .: 25.09
<S> i was at the louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls ; and , pardieu , i picked up two that i sold for ten pistoles each .: 54.36
<S> had she one redeeming trait ?: 401.07
<S> these glances frequently exasperated the pride of danglars , but this evening he took no notice of them .: 59.05
<S> the people have seen monsieur de conde , a prince of the blood royal , arrested by my mother in law , maria de medicis ; they saw my mother in law , their former regent , expelled by the cardinal ; they saw monsieur de vendome , that is to say , the son of henry iv. , a prisoner at vincennes ; and whilst these great personages were imprisoned , insulted and threatened , they said nothing ; and now for a broussel good god !: 55.81
<S> the vicar himself awaited him , conducted him to the top of the tower , and when there pointed to a little door , placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner of the wall , that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return , and went down again .: 23.99
<S> he then endeavored to re enter the marvellous grottos , but they had suddenly receded , and now the path became a labyrinth , and then the entrance vanished , and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman .: 80.88
<S> athos examined it and became very pale .: 34.97
<S> and now , monsieur d artagnan , he said , prepare to set off for saint germain and take a letter from me to the queen . chapter lxxxviii .: 17.63
<S> and now go , mordaunt . before i go , said mordaunt , i have some questions and a favor to ask you , sir . a favor from me ? mordaunt bowed .: 46.13
<S> that s a great story to tell me , porthos !: 24.64
<S> you will take it to the count , and say that , although in haste to attend the chamber , my master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him . i never speak to his excellency , replied the concierge ; the valet de chambre will carry your message . the groom returned to the carriage .: 25.08
<S> she traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage .: 69.87
<S> in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbe , dante s spoke no more of escape .: 77.75
<S> i shall buy a chestnut colored suit .: 65.51
<S> where is he ? waiting below , in my carriage . seek him at once . i hasten to do so . the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man ; his really sincere royalism made him youthful again .: 59.73
<S> what do you want ? screamed milady .: 11.22
<S> one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon .: 49.15
<S> their masters are dead !: 69.56
<S> at last , after crossing the courts of the palais royal , where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests , they entered the garden and reached the little gate .: 38.02
<S> the latter seemed to have resigned himself ; he drew the corks , and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat .: 56.20
<S> wait , madame , continued athos , what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what i have narrated . monsieur , said madame de chevreuse , i believe you are a sorcerer ; i am prepared for anything .: 27.93
<S> her crimes , i know them not ; her disorders , i know them not ; her vices , i know them not .: 84.30
<S> he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart , if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment .: 48.41
<S> athos entered without the least mistrust , and took out two pistoles to pay the bill .: 32.19
<S> bravery is always respected , even in an enemy .: 108.83
<S> come hither , and let us talk . the host approached with hesitation .: 25.63
<S> and therefore , my dear monsieur bernouin , if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master , announce to her majesty that i have come , and tell her with what purpose . whether he spoke seriously or in jest , since it was evident that under existing circumstances d artagnan was the only man who could relieve the queen s uneasiness , bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy ; and as he had foreseen , the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur d artagnan at once .: 49.13
<S> well , baron , i promise you some good exercise ! said the gascon .: 25.65
<S> nine tenths of the english people are horrified at what you say . this voice was that of athos , who , standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind , thus assailed the public accuser .: 49.01
<S> the name he pronounced , in a voice of tenderness , amounting almost to love , was that of hayde e .: 40.26
<S> but having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon madame de montbazon pass in her carriage , and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman , he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to mazarin , and in the hope of seeing her again , had asked for a leaden comb , which was allowed him .: 48.91
<S> no , no , doubtless he was deceived , and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death !: 39.78
<S> bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve .: 77.77
<S> sir , said he , do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock , such as m. noirtier has received , without any detriment to his mental faculties ? it is not exactly that , sir , said the notary , which makes me uneasy , but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions , so as to be able to get his answers . you must see that to be an utter impossibility , said villefort .: 40.57
<S> she wore a blue and white striped vest , with long open sleeves , trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls , and a sort of bodice , which , closing only from the centre to the waist , exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom ; it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps .: 65.83
<S> release broussel ! she cried , never ! at this moment steps were heard in the ante room and without any announcement the marechal de la meilleraie appeared at the door .: 35.42
<S> sire , i thought his name was unknown to your majesty . no , no , blacas ; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding , ambitious , too , and , pardieu ! you know his father s name ! his father ? yes , noirtier . noirtier the girondin ? noirtier the senator ? he himself . and your majesty has employed the son of such a man ? blacas , my friend , you have but limited comprehension .: 44.08
<S> it seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening .: 66.19
<S> when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau , he raised his finger to his lips , to warn him to be silent , and , ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium , entered the chamber by the middle arcade , and advanced towards vampa , who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps .: 32.13
<S> mazarin did not even turn around .: 42.42
<S> a hundred pistoles !: 13.60
<S> you ought to be brave for two reasons : the first is that you are a gascon , and the second is that you are my son .: 35.29
<S> after having sought for a few minutes , he stopped at a leaf which had several notes , and compared them with the deed of sale , which lay on the table , and recalling his souvenirs auteuil , rue de la fontaine , no .: 49.14
<S> yes , sir , he said , in a softened tone .: 8.55
<S> morrel obeyed ; guided by valentine , he had learned how to understand the old man quickly .: 57.10
<S> he is , doubtless , come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague .: 55.08
<S> what would you do ? i should give up broussel , said porthos .: 15.64
<S> by my honor , these gascons are incorrigible !: 54.09
<S> well , well , said m. morrel , i know there was no one in fault but destiny .: 25.41
<S> yes , but he couldn t understand what it meant , for he had spent that night with a dying person and marie michon had left his house before his return . you must know , monsieur , that marie michon , when she returned to france in 1643 , immediately sought for information about that child ; as a fugitive she could not take care of it , but on her return she wished to have it near her . and what said the abbe ? asked athos .: 42.70
<S> if you are willing , gentlemen , i will sleep across your doorway , and you will then be certain that nobody can reach you . and on what will you sleep ? said d artagnan .: 27.07
<S> only this time it was no longer an inert body , without feeling , that the villain had to deal with .: 40.99
<S> gaetano departed with the reply .: 68.51
<S> the storm still continued .: 76.52
<S> i expected , as i told you , to reach the outer wall , pierce through it , and throw myself into the sea ; i have , however , kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens , instead of going beneath it .: 36.60
<S> what would you have proposed , maximilian , had you found me willing to accede ? it is not for me to say . you are wrong ; you must advise me what to do . do you seriously ask my advice , valentine ? certainly , dear maximilian , for if it is good , i will follow it ; you know my devotion to you . valentine , said morrel pushing aside a loose plank , give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger ; my senses are confused , and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain .: 40.55
<S> the novice , seeing milady in bed , was about to follow the example of the superior ; but milady stopped her .: 31.49
<S> it was a large cabinet , close and stifling , with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive , and in which there was already a fire , although it was scarcely the end of the month of september .: 49.61
<S> the same evening , when the flock was safe at the farm , the little luigi hastened to the smith at palestrina , took a large nail , heated and sharpened it , and formed a sort of stylus .: 44.12
<S> he then entered the room .: 7.95
<S> you were no stranger to me , for i knew you from the time i gave up two rooms to you , invited you to breakfast with me , lent you one of my carriages , witnessed the carnival in your company , and saw with you from a window in the piazza del popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted .: 64.63
<S> some hours afterwards it began again , nearer and more distinct .: 48.84
<S> grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture .: 54.66
<S> his majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the day ; he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address .: 31.39
<S> i will say , then , monsieur , quite short . you may even say , my lord , replied athos , who stickled for propriety .: 32.07
<S> what he ? asked the cardinal .: 12.15
<S> the curate , astonished at his quickness and intelligence , made him a present of pens , paper , and a penknife .: 38.56
<S> oh , yes , monsieur le comte , you know me and i know you .: 16.67
<S> it was the second time he had been worsted , and this time on his own ground .: 23.17
<S> ah , you see that plan was not sure enough ; he might go out by one gate and return by another . where is he , then ? in the cellar . the cellar what cellar ? our landlord s , to be sure .: 58.07
<S> albert was punctual .: 25.17
<S> what is his birthplace ?: 29.89
<S> it s not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health . my health is well enough , said fernand , clenching his hands without raising his head .: 58.52
<S> since lord de winter left him i am distracted , sirs .: 68.69
<S> a brute , that cardinal .: 122.26
<S> and to be free , a prisoner has to pierce a wall , detach bars , cut through a floor all undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish , but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way .: 121.06
<S> how unfortunate i am ! said she ; i have been here six months without the shadow of recreation .: 28.26
<S> what have i to do with politics ?: 13.75
<S> for example , an english prince died one day because they had put him into a butt of malmsey .: 89.48
<S> is it the custom in marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in their anterooms ? father ! cried villefort , then i was not deceived ; i felt sure it must be you . well , then , if you felt so sure , replied the new comer , putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair , allow me to say , my dear ge rard , that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the door . leave us , germain , said villefort .: 38.43
<S> but as we have said , he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph .: 20.99
<S> aramis has always fifty duchesses quarreling over the priest , as they quarreled formerly over the musketeer ; but i what have i in the world ?: 122.77
<S> i may then tell the cardinal , with respect to this little woman that he may be at ease . is that all ? he will know what that means . he will guess , at least .: 39.00
<S> look ! cried the king , drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk , which threw it on its haunches , and seizing the bridle of athos s horse .: 30.23
<S> when you return i will set the fuse myself , but be careful to conceal your face , so that you can not be recognized by them . never fear . there s ten o clock striking at greenwich . groslow , then , having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance , went down into the longboat and soon reached greenwich .: 68.94
<S> the approach was not such as to prepossess people an ill smelling , dark passage , a staircase half lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard ; on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails , like the principal gate of the grand cha telet .: 121.45
<S> come , do you really think you have anything to say against me ?: 17.18
<S> thieves might strip the house it would annoy me less than to be disobeyed . baptistin bowed .: 99.70
<S> i am here to petition you , too happy should my prayer be favorably heard . i am listening , madame , with the greatest interest , said mazarin .: 46.51
<S> the villa of san felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely carmela .: 65.50
<S> eh !: 18.68
<S> their joy was great .: 73.61
<S> now , my dear count , he said , let us on with all the speed we may .: 18.90
<S> your milady , said he , appears to be an infamous creature , but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her .: 43.29
<S> no , no ; like shakespeare s polonius , he died for another .: 55.30
<S> yes ; i think so , at least , said the young girl hesitatingly .: 14.92
<S> he was incessantly attacked by them , and the superior , to whom he had confided this misfortune , wishing as much as in him lay to free him from them , had advised him , in order to conjure away the tempting demon , to have recourse to the bell rope , and ring with all his might .: 69.85
<S> in proportion as her memory became clearer , the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light ; what she had taken for confusion was a tumult ; what she had regarded as something distressing , was in reality a disgrace .: 126.74
<S> these active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some unknown labor ; these were the beggars of the court of miracles the agents of the giver of holy water in the square of saint eustache , preparing barricades for the morrow .: 128.80
<S> send the case before the judges ; it is their business to judge , and they shall judge . only , replied tre ville , it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live , the purest life , the most incontestable virtue , can not exempt a man from infamy and persecution .: 67.98
<S> noirtier closed his right eye .: 49.05
<S> yes , in so many words ; and it must be so , for the abbe knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe . be it half a million , then ; but on my word of honor , i had no idea that it was so much . because you are robbed by your steward .: 34.29
<S> but such is man , we always want something more than we already have . what does porthos wish for ? to be a baron . ah , true !: 63.46
<S> there are several branches of the d artagnans at tarbes and in its environs , said the cardinal ; to which do you belong ? i am the son of him who served in the religious wars under the great king henry , the father of his gracious majesty . that is well .: 58.65
<S> andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs , and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card .: 88.00
<S> felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty , covered with dust , and streaming with perspiration .: 32.45
<S> lead two sheep to the butcher s , two oxen to the slaughterhouse , and make one of them understand that his companion will not die ; the sheep will bleat for pleasure , the ox will bellow with joy .: 92.82
<S> they are mistaken ; bring him here at eight o clock , sir , and may heaven bless you as i bless you ! and now tis your turn , said the coadjutor , turning to the last that remained ; have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us ? better , my lord . diable !: 44.43
<S> yes ; he is at work in his library , but he expects you , sir , replied the valet .: 24.66
<S> he approached the window , and saw his father get into it , and drive away .: 35.97
<S> ah ! exclaimed aramis , that is the nephew , the monk , and the son of milady , as he says himself . alas , yes , murmured de winter .: 19.29
<S> he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count , and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights .: 48.49
<S> from here to paris it is a hundred and forty leagues ; before our letter was at angers we should be in a dungeon . as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty , said aramis , coloring , i will take that upon myself .: 55.44
<S> i was sensible that i could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance .: 66.83
<S> yes , said aramis , impart it to us , my dear friend , unless the honor of any lady be hazarded by this confidence ; in that case you would do better to keep it to yourself . be satisfied , replied d artagnan ; the honor of no one will have cause to complain of what i have to tell . he then related to his friends , word for word , all that had passed between him and his host , and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the jolly miller .: 31.79
<S> ask them to sing one more song ; it is so delightful to hear music in the distance , when the musicians are unrestrained by observation . danglars was quite annoyed by the young man s indifference .: 75.62
<S> the day was as gay as the preceding one , perhaps even more animated and noisy ; the count appeared for an instant at his window , but when they again passed he had disappeared .: 42.40
<S> so beautiful !: 50.74
<S> the moment of your deliverance is at hand ; have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time and absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments they have so long professed and truly entertained .: 94.33
<S> the minister made a slight sign with his head , whereupon the queen said to madame beauvais : it is time for the king to go to bed ; call laporte . the queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed , and several times louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was ; but now he made no reply , but turned pale and bit his lips with anger .: 43.60
<S> i wore a long sword which cut like a damascus you remember it , aramis for you always called it balizarde .: 147.17
<S> are you a man ?: 13.53
<S> assassin , assassin , assassin , you have still on your brow your master s blood !: 54.08
<S> the horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him .: 77.82
<S> the king therefore arose a minute after , and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket , the major part of which arose from his winnings , la vieuville , said he , take my place ; i must speak to monsieur de tre ville on an affair of importance .: 56.57
<S> father , father , in heaven s name , exclaimed the young man , what are these weapons for ? maximilian , replied morrel , looking fixedly at his son , you are a man , and a man of honor .: 24.84
<S> my dear mother , said he , do you know if m. de morcerf has any enemy ? merce de s started ; she noticed that the young man did not say my father . my son , she said , persons in the count s situation have many secret enemies .: 30.30
<S> woe , he cried , to those who confined me in that wretched prison ; and woe to those who forgot that i was there ! 50229m as he repassed the catalans , the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman .: 57.89
<S> my friend !: 14.96
<S> albert , in his turn , sat behind .: 19.92
<S> barrois , said the doctor , can you speak ? barrois muttered a few unintelligible words .: 35.50
<S> come , recover . the procureur dropped his head ; his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever , and yet he was deadly pale .: 44.92
<S> do you fear any approaching evil ?: 118.24
<S> only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can demand aid and a village from which we can fetch a priest . thank you , and god reward you !: 62.09
<S> and did the eccentric person commit any new originality ? can he be seen without doing so ?: 133.83
<S> one of the two guardsmen was engaged that evening , and another the next , so the meeting was fixed for the day after that .: 52.17
<S> aided by the remaining fragment , i guessed the rest ; measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper , and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed , as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us . and what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion ? i resolved to set out , and did set out at that very instant , carrying with me the beginning of my great work , the unity of the italian kingdom ; but for some time the imperial police who at this period , quite contrary to what napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him , wished for a partition of provinces had their eyes on me ; and my hasty departure , the cause of which they were unable to guess , having aroused their suspicions , i was arrested at the very moment i was leaving piombino .: 81.52
<S> ah , stop !: 19.73
<S> ask him then , for the written order .: 65.09
<S> oh , hear me to the end !: 37.92
<S> when they had advanced about twenty yards , danglars looked back and saw fernand stoop , pick up the crumpled paper , and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards pillon .: 80.54
<S> i am on my own ground , and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall , and to look over when i please , without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character .: 50.71
<S> morrel was mad .: 24.43
<S> comminges , so to speak , threw broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him .: 52.88
<S> after me it will all be over , and people will hunt with gins , snares , and traps .: 73.22
<S> who prepared it ? the chemist who came here with me . 40116m drink it , said the doctor to barrois .: 95.55
<S> the cardinal exaggerated , as i perceive . but pray , sir , continued aramis , who , seeing his captain become appeased , ventured to risk a prayer , do not say that athos is wounded .: 63.18
<S> e tienne soon returned from his errand .: 58.22
<S> and to sign the contract in three days ? yes . then , in my turn , i also say , very well ! danglars pressed his daughter s hand in his .: 34.91
<S> we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo , by the via del babuino , for i shall be glad to pass , myself , through the corso , to see if some orders i have given have been executed . excellency , said a servant , opening the door , a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you . ah !: 29.02
<S> i must positively find out who and what he is , said franz , rising from his seat .: 33.47
<S> d artagnan trembled ; and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him , without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance .: 39.75
<S> what , are you no longer in possession of your senses ?: 21.29
<S> we arrived four or five days ago from the vendomois , as you know , and we are going to give mazarin something to do .: 31.46
<S> morrel s clear eye was for the moment clouded , then it shone with unusual lustre , and a large tear rolled down his cheek .: 44.16
<S> during the whole five years in which the duc de beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape .: 34.31
<S> the last raised his eyes , to ascertain , doubtless , that neither his companions nor himself had been watched , and , in spite of the darkness , he perceived gondy .: 42.53
<S> it was to that obedience i owe her portrait . d artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended .: 83.74
<S> what though she has lost her own mother at a tender age , she has had the happiness to find a second mother in madame de villefort . the world , however , is mistaken ; my father abandons me from utter indifference , while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile . hate you , sweet valentine , exclaimed the young man ; how is it possible for anyone to do that ? alas , replied the weeping girl , i am obliged to own that my stepmother s aversion to me arises from a very natural source her overweening love for her own child , my brother edward . but why should it ? i do not know ; but , though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation , i will just say this much that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there ; and i much fear she envies me the fortune i enjoy in right of my mother , and which will be more than doubled at the death of m. and mme .: 64.81
<S> without doubt , porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments , for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand , he pulled it toward him , so that d artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of porthos .: 52.77
<S> hey !: 27.97
<S> well , you do not reply ? resumed mazarin .: 21.25
<S> olivain , we have come into possession of two horses , but i have lost my own .: 27.33
<S> then if you wish to take my advice , said the young man coldly , i would recommend you to travel . to travel ! she murmured .: 36.31
<S> sir , said villefort , have you any enemies , at least , that you know . i have enemies ? replied dante s ; my position is not sufficiently elevated for that .: 34.80
<S> you remain minister ; that is understood , said d artagnan ; france needs you . and i desist from my pretensions , said aramis .: 55.42
<S> at the denunciating sound , the monks would be rendered aware that temptation was besieging a brother , and all the community would go to prayers .: 89.56
<S> speak to me not as a magistrate , but as a friend ; and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit , do not tell me that i ought to be gay . villefort bowed .: 29.72
<S> he can not acknowledge me openly , it appears , but he does it through m. cavalcanti , and gives him fifty thousand francs for it . fifty thousand francs for being your father ?: 50.39
<S> with the duke s aid they already considered themselves invincible .: 79.22
<S> never , never ! i believe you , said mme .: 29.99
<S> athos smiled ; the smile was melancholy .: 40.01
<S> well ! resumed the citizen , well , monsieur , my wife was abducted yesterday morning , as she was coming out of her workroom . and by whom was your wife abducted ? i know nothing surely , monsieur , but i suspect someone . and who is the person whom you suspect ? a man who has pursued her a long time . the devil ! but allow me to tell you , monsieur , continued the citizen , that i am convinced that there is less love than politics in all this . less love than politics , replied d artagnan , with a reflective air ; and what do you suspect ? i do not know whether i ought to tell you what i suspect . monsieur , i beg you to observe that i ask you absolutely nothing .: 36.01
<S> prince cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities . 40276m listen , said the baroness , smiling ; speaking to you as a friend i can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be .: 45.46
<S> what do you say that she wanted to have her brother in law killed ? yes . she was married ? asked aramis .: 21.31
<S> what is it ? said the light horseman .: 10.43
<S> go on ! said felton ; you see plainly that i listen , and that i am anxious to know the end . evening came ; the ordinary events took place .: 33.12
<S> what line would you advise me to study ? the one that is most in use just at this time . the spanish one , you mean , i suppose ? yes ; should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you no , said monte cristo ; since , as i told you before , i do not wish to comprehend it .: 43.72
<S> wholly yours , aramis . d artagnan tried to recall his remembrances .: 30.99
<S> in the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal .: 46.23
<S> because she had been branded , continued d artagnan .: 22.98
<S> i missed her by twenty minutes at st. omer .: 54.26
<S> all this negotiation must be carried on openly . i will follow your eminence s instructions to the letter .: 43.26
<S> madame morrel sent her daughter to bed , and half an hour after julie had retired , she rose , took off her shoes , and went stealthily along the passage , to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing .: 42.87
<S> if paris has injuries to complain of , who has not some wrongs to be redressed ?: 116.80
<S> oh , my god !: 5.20
<S> as for the count of monte cristo , he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved .: 29.89
<S> he felt the need of making a trip in the ile de france , and begged us the comte de la fere and monsieur du vallon to accompany him .: 17.85
<S> this loophole , which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside , to an opening through which a child could not have passed , was , for better security , furnished with three iron bars , so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner s escape .: 75.07
<S> baroness , said danglars , give me leave to present to you the count of monte cristo , who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at rome .: 31.52
<S> her maiden name was de servie res , and her first husband was colonel the marquis of nargonne . i have not the honor of knowing madame danglars ; but i have already met m. lucien debray . ah , indeed ? said danglars ; and where was that ? at the house of m. de morcerf . ah !: 38.16
<S> wait ! and regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands on .: 129.02
<S> during twenty he had been lieutenant , their captain since the night before .: 91.84
<S> conferences .: 217.06
<S> noirtier , rue coq he ron , no .: 61.55
<S> the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of abe lard and he loi se , placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse , and following the undertaker s men , arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial .: 55.08
<S> however , jacopo insisted on following him , and dante s did not oppose this , fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust .: 59.53
<S> these rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force , said the comte de la fere .: 31.46
<S> he was the first to jump on shore ; and had he dared , he would , like lucius brutus , have kissed his mother earth . it was dark , but at eleven o clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean , whose every wave she silvered , and then , ascending high , played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second pelion .: 88.78
<S> i go to the louvre ; i ask for mme .: 22.39
<S> i have ; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us . he shall be both blind and deaf , replied the young man , with an air of determination that made his companion shudder .: 43.20
<S> milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes , and she ordered kitty to come at nine o clock in the morning to take a third letter .: 21.44
<S> you are right he is worth us all , and we avow it to you ! aramis , said athos , are you jesting ? no , no , dear friend ; i state only what we all know .: 39.05
<S> but tell me all about it ? why do you wish to know ? asked cavalcanti .: 12.46
<S> the walls are thick , the doors strong , and the bars solid ; besides , your window opens immediately over the sea .: 85.71
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> you have , doubtless , already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you ? an agreeable one ? asked the italian .: 43.66
<S> ah , sir ! cried olivain , what are you doing ?: 8.01
<S> nevertheless , when he waited at the dinner given by his master , and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it , he believed his fortune made , and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a cr sus .: 52.88
<S> you are welcome , gentlemen , she said .: 12.25
<S> but i can not i am starving .: 33.07
<S> excuse me for speaking so very candidly , but as this is intended only for ourselves , i do not see why i should weigh my words .: 69.35
<S> my lord , said athos , we are satisfied ; we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordship s service and his most faithful servants . my most faithful friends , gentlemen , my most faithful friends ; you have proved it .: 37.88
<S> false ! he muttered .: 26.14
<S> i have always heard how cheap poultry is in italy ; i should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at rome . there , he said , throwing a louis down .: 57.05
<S> oh , grace , grace , pardon ! cried the wretch , falling on her knees .: 21.44
<S> you will return after three or four years with a russian princess for a bride , and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years ago . thank you , my dear beauchamp , thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice ; but it can not be .: 53.08
<S> the house to which d artagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening .: 33.49
<S> teresa uttered a cry of admiration .: 10.93
<S> he described to him his interview with the cardinal , and said , for the third time drawing his commission from his pocket , you , our friend , our intelligence , our invisible protector , accept this commission .: 45.34
<S> d artagnan retired to bed not to sleep , but to think over all he had heard that evening .: 51.82
<S> here i await the army of my rebellious subjects .: 69.17
<S> you know i hate moralizing , except when it is done by athos .: 71.84
<S> i practiced this exercise , and as nature has endowed me with some faculties , at this day i can throw the lasso with any man in the world .: 60.88
<S> if i thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency , i would blow his brains out with my own hand ! 20211m well , said the count , turning towards franz , i told you there was some mistake in this . are you not alone ? asked vampa with uneasiness .: 24.19
<S> since my misfortunes i have been subject to faintnesses , which seize me all at once , and i have just felt a cold shiver .: 49.22
<S> suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and grimaud uttered a shout of joy ; every one turned around and beheld athos , livid , his eyes dim and his hands trembling , supporting himself on the edge of the boat .: 54.04
<S> for life , replied porthos , in the same manner .: 16.37
<S> what is it ? i hear a horse . it belongs to one of our companions , who is overtaking us . no , said d artagnan , it is in advance . that is another thing , said porthos ; and he listened toward the quarter indicated by d artagnan .: 22.45
<S> at length athos , after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual , made a sign of assent to d artagnan , who by it understood he was at liberty to speak .: 25.54
<S> hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob .: 181.93
<S> these exploits had gained luigi considerable reputation .: 275.41
<S> this , with my spanish affairs , made a pretty end to the month . then you really lost by that affair in spain ? yes ; only 700,000 francs out of my cash box nothing more ! why , how could you make such a mistake such an old stager ? oh , it is all my wife s fault .: 63.40
<S> the travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet with less interruption ; but at cre vec ur , aramis declared he could proceed no farther .: 59.41
<S> ah , for the sake of our child , let me live ! 50167m no , no , no , i tell you ; one day , if i allow you to live , you will perhaps kill him , as you have the others ! i ? i kill my boy ? cried the distracted mother , rushing toward villefort ; i kill my son ?: 40.51
<S> but do not despair ; you have life before you , my dear albert , for you are yet scarcely twenty two years old ; and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name , take my father s it was herrera .: 56.88
<S> after having been so long in love with madame de chevreuse , you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy ! yes , replied aramis , with an absent air ; yes , that poor duchess !: 39.91
<S> there are your instructions , said mazarin ; go ! go !: 31.92
<S> what do you say , maximilian ? asked valentine .: 6.17
<S> as to the servant , she had run away at the moment of her master s arrest .: 19.13
<S> as d artagnan so constantly frequented the ho tel , no difficulty was made in complying with his request , and a servant went to inform m. de tre ville that his young compatriot , having something important to communicate , solicited a private audience .: 60.35
<S> i had no such contempt for men before . was i not a good ambassador in france ? yes , for mazarin has granted what i desire . have i not always fought for your glory and interests ? too ardently , perhaps ; it is what i have just reproached you for .: 70.57
<S> porthos had , in fact , been involved in a dispute with the bishop of noyon in regard to the pierrefonds property , which adjoined his own , and weary at length of a legal controversy which was beyond his comprehension , he put an end to it by purchasing pierrefonds and added that name to his others .: 97.15
<S> but , meanwhile , caderousse , who had never taken his eyes off his companion , passed his hand behind his back , and opened a long spanish knife , which he always carried with him , to be ready in case of need .: 40.83
<S> most of my readers are aware that the second act of parisina opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which parisina , while sleeping , betrays to azzo the secret of her love for ugo .: 97.56
<S> he opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were , and found porthos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis .: 43.89
<S> villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin .: 54.61
<S> dante s uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror , dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison , wreaked his anger upon everything , and chiefly upon himself , so that the least thing , a grain of sand , a straw , or a breath of air that annoyed him , led to paroxysms of fury .: 86.05
<S> the people had made no demonstration for the princes , but they had risen for broussel ; they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves .: 62.26
<S> well ? asked the duke .: 7.88
<S> felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word .: 37.15
<S> my brother , said she , as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders , be careful of yourself , for if you are killed , i shall be alone in the world . these words carried a ray of hope into fernand s heart .: 26.77
<S> those were the count s windows . why , he must be a nabob .: 42.15
<S> d artagnan raised himself on tiptoe , and as the carriage passed , saw harrison at one window and mordaunt at the other .: 31.83
<S> i often ask pardon of god , i swear to you , because this action , the only one with which i have seriously to reproach myself in all my life , is no doubt the cause of my abject condition .: 41.75
<S> you may easily imagine with what eagerness i welcomed him , and how minutely i related the whole of what i had seen and heard .: 47.72
<S> cromwell had sent him to mazarin .: 28.25
<S> do you understand ? asked villefort .: 7.55
<S> now , said athos , sleep , or try to sleep , my friends , and i will watch . in a few moments , notwithstanding their wet clothes , the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror , these hardy adventurers , with their iron frames , inured to every hardship , threw themselves down , intending to profit by the advice of athos , who sat at the helm , pensively wakeful , guiding the little bark the way it was to go , his eyes fixed on the heavens , as if he sought to verify not only the road to france , but the benign aspect of protecting providence .: 66.60
<S> felton reappeared , and without observing whether milady had or had not touched her repast , made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room , it having been brought in ready spread .: 59.27
<S> thus , sure that the rider would not release his hold , raoul now only directed his attention to the horse , which he guided to the opposite bank , helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with words .: 85.13
<S> bonacieux became livid ; a fearful agony pervaded her frame , and she sank panting into the arms of porthos and aramis .: 33.64
<S> i won t have him killed i won t !: 29.69
<S> do you know that , monsieur ? the king commands it , madame ; excuse me . i will not suffer it !: 24.47
<S> and be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to england or the continent . milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes .: 57.35
<S> i will tell you the real facts .: 21.09
<S> gentlemen , said d artagnan , it is half past four , and we have scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six . besides , if we go out too late , nobody will see us , said porthos , and that will be a pity .: 20.88
<S> halloo ! he cried , are the prisoners still there ? yes , sir , answered the sergeant , uncovering .: 32.55
<S> corbleu ! i am more your friend than you think for after our very first encounter , i could by saying a word to the cardinal have had your throat cut ! they this time embraced heartily , and without retaining any malice .: 125.11
<S> a woman , and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex , i am alarmed at the idea of civil war ; a queen , accustomed to be obeyed , i am excited at the first opposition . madame , replied gondy , bowing , your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as opposition .: 68.60
<S> grimaud , said athos , still on the breach , another musket ! grimaud immediately obeyed .: 41.83
<S> he recalled his arrival on the island , his presentation to a smuggler chief , a subterranean palace full of splendor , an excellent supper , and a spoonful of hashish .: 66.11
<S> yes , replied he , while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and grace yes , he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me , and does all he can to prove it .: 36.74
<S> she has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty .: 138.09
<S> in england , lately , we failed , we were beaten , and that is a blemish on our reputation . by whom , then , were we beaten ? asked porthos .: 38.90
<S> but , first , interposed d artagnan , you must present me to madame du vallon . a third sigh from porthos .: 39.99
<S> thanks to the garden , we yet can flee ; i have the key , but make haste !: 49.40
<S> de villefort , said louis xviii. , the duc de blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate . sire , the duke is right , and i believe your majesty will think it equally important . 0137m in the first place , and before everything else , sir , is the news as bad in your opinion as i am asked to believe ? sire , i believe it to be most urgent , but i hope , by the speed i have used , that it is not irreparable . speak as fully as you please , sir , said the king , who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in blacas s face and affected villefort s voice .: 43.02
<S> since you demand my resignation , i retire . then , said aramis , in his neighbor s ear , the conferences are over .: 38.46
<S> he would not sell his horse ; not for a kingdom !: 77.29
<S> then my friends and i took her , tried her , and condemned her . d artagnan then related the poisoning of mme .: 41.14
<S> you appear to think much of your horse .: 52.73
<S> the queen is likely to follow mazarin s counsels and to have me tried . do you think she loves this italian so much as they say she does ? did she not love an englishman ? my friend , she is a woman . no , no , you are deceived she is a queen . dear friend , i shall sacrifice myself and go and see anne of austria . adieu , athos , i am going to raise an army . for what purpose ? to come back and besiege rueil . where shall we meet again ? at the foot of the cardinal s gallows . the two friends departed aramis to return to paris , athos to take measures preparatory to an interview with the queen .: 43.28
<S> albert at this moment ran in .: 36.49
<S> some straw , they said .: 70.79
<S> vampa was twelve , and teresa eleven .: 107.24
<S> it is , however , impossible that this should end as they have decreed ! in fact , as this last reflection indicated this instinctive return to hope sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent spirit .: 120.53
<S> suddenly he rallied , made a violent effort to restrain himself , and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance .: 27.14
<S> by a chance , which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness , the moon , which was on the wane , did not rise until eleven o clock , and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity .: 48.58
<S> valentine was so pale , so cold , so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house , and they flew into the passage crying for help .: 68.70
<S> how are you to get away from here ?: 31.14
<S> look well at that man ; it is he who raised your father s head on the point of a spear ; it is he who sold us ; it is he who forsook us !: 26.33
<S> first , you purchase a house at auteuil this house is the one where i have committed an assassination ; you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended ; you stop at the spot where he received the blow ; and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child .: 45.80
<S> all these proofs of love which you would give me are almost crimes . because you do not love me , madame !: 38.67
<S> we did not see his companion come out . he may have gone by the other door . what is he doing ? putting on his cloak and gloves . he s ours , muttered d artagnan .: 33.53
<S> if you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation .: 21.77
<S> valentine had solved the problem , and was able easily to understand his thoughts , and to convey her own in return , and , through her untiring and devoted assiduity , it was seldom that , in the ordinary transactions of every day life , she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living , thinking mind , or the wants of the almost inanimate body .: 83.04
<S> one more turn , captain ; twenty pistoles on one throw only one , the last . done for twenty , replied groslow .: 144.14
<S> what these stuffs did there , it was impossible to say ; they awaited , while gratifying the eyes , a destination unknown to their owner himself ; in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections .: 120.97
<S> another queen in want of help .: 73.66
<S> and yet , in all this , the cardinal had not yet said a word about the duke of buckingham .: 18.92
<S> his hat was a little napless , his feather was a little faded , his gold lace was a little tarnished , his laces were a trifle frayed ; but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen , and porthos was still the handsome porthos .: 48.53
<S> they had talked of no one but morcerf the whole day .: 45.50
<S> then the officer began to pass in review all the people , one after the other , and stopping when he came to milady , surveyed her very closely , but without addressing a single word to her .: 35.00
<S> madame , replied the president , bowing with profound respect , allow me to ask one question ; it shall be the last : can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated ? i can , sir , said hayde e , drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed ; for here is the register of my birth , signed by my father and his principal officers , and that of my baptism , my father having consented to my being brought up in my mother s faith , this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus ; and lastly and perhaps the most important , the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the armenian merchant el kobbir , by the french officer , who , in his infamous bargain with the porte , had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor , whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs . a greenish pallor spread over the count s cheeks , and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations , which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence .: 56.07
<S> it is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven ; on the contrary , we are all free agents . alas ! exclaimed merce de s , if it were so , if i possessed free will , but without the power to render that will efficacious , it would drive me to despair . monte cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her grief .: 35.63
<S> the breakfast room was finished in oak ; the salon in mahogany , and the furnishings were of blue velvet ; the bedroom was in citronwood and green damask .: 65.91
<S> at length , after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken , a carriage appeared , coming at a quick pace on the road of se vres .: 35.11
<S> mesdemoiselles noblet , julia , and leroux executed the customary pirouettes ; robert duly challenged the prince of granada ; and the royal father of the princess isabella , taking his daughter by the hand , swept round the stage with majestic strides , the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle .: 110.41
<S> the fellows looked at the body of their companion , swimming in blood , and then recovering voice and legs together , ran screaming off .: 107.09
<S> d artagnan was acquainted with villars cotterets , having gone thither with the court on several occasions ; for at that time villars cotterets was a royal residence .: 60.89
<S> is there anything new in the wind ? nothing . i thought , perhaps , that the king s death has only hastened their flight ; in ten minutes they will perhaps be here . what have you come for , then ? to embark with you . ah !: 44.84
<S> there were only chimeras and illusions ; but for real love , for true jealousy , is there any reality except illusions and chimeras ?: 139.72
<S> 25th april , 1498 .: 30.40
