<S> go on , monsieur bertuccio , said the count .: 7.60
<S> i understand perfectly . again danglars bit his lips ; he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort , and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more <UNK> .: 107.54

<S> you are right , duchess .: 33.09
<S> i am , replied dante s , in bad italian , a maltese sailor .: 75.13
<S> you will see me talking with one of my friends , the abbe d herblay , of whom you have often heard me speak . i remember him , monsieur . come near to us from time to time , as if to speak ; but do not speak , and do not listen .: 31.72
<S> four days , replied his friend , are necessary to reach blois ; one day to rest there ; three or four days to return to paris .: 59.72
<S> during all this time , the general , on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother , manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance .: 134.94
<S> listen to me . edmond saw there was no escape , and placing the old man on his bed , he seated himself on the stool beside him .: 37.66
<S> that monsieur d artagnan is a very brave man , mother , said the young king .: 16.29
<S> i warn you that i will never again work in the dark , and that i will know not only to what i expose myself , but for whom i expose myself . an illustrious person sends you ; an illustrious person awaits you .: 101.02
<S> <UNK> !: 469.88
<S> yes , but when once they are <UNK> , our necks will be <UNK> next . if one of them comes to my side , asked porthos , must i kill him ? yes , by a blow of your fist , if you can ; we will not fire but at the last extremity . i can do it , said porthos .: 60.12
<S> the moment you leave me , valentine , i am alone in the world .: 19.50
<S> i would take the hundred pistoles .: 21.15
<S> they both came immediately , m. morrel bringing a doctor , and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels , and ordered him a limited diet .: 174.49
<S> it was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful , and the blow was so great he rushed out , overcome , and forgot to shut the door .: 130.97
<S> good bye , count . morcerf took his hat , and left the room .: 21.45
<S> humph ! thought i , that looks like my <UNK> ; i fancy i must have <UNK> that skull somewhere or other . and , in fact , it was that unfortunate scotchman , parry s brother , you know , on whom groslow amused himself by trying his strength .: 180.66
<S> little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day ; at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain , where it paused an instant , like the fiery crest of a volcano , then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base , and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker ; half an hour after , the night was quite dark .: 145.83
<S> certainly ; and why should i regret what gives you pleasure ? oh !: 70.38
<S> yes , sir . by whom ? inquired cromwell .: 17.11
<S> then it became the turn of athos , porthos , and aramis to mount guard with d artagnan when he was on duty .: 32.97
<S> peste ! you seem to reverse ordinary customs , and come home at the hour when other people are going out . no one can reproach you for anything of the kind , monsieur bonacieux , said the young man ; you are a model for regular people .: 85.57
<S> you know me well enough . we no longer know anyone , madame . you must be mad , my friend , said the baroness .: 21.55
<S> aramis , you think that d artagnan , that porthos , would lend their hands to such an infamy ? among friends , my dear athos , no , you are right ; but among enemies it would be only a stratagem . athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head .: 96.79
<S> my clothes were near me on a chair ; i neither remembered having <UNK> myself nor going to bed .: 187.41
<S> i held back his arm .: 62.15
<S> is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles ? yes ; and remember that two <UNK> tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others . never mind ; let us go on . with all my heart !: 111.52
<S> one of the sailors leaped on shore , a cord creaked as it ran through a <UNK> , and dante s guessed they were at the end of the voyage , and that they were <UNK> the boat .: 65.90
<S> this was more terrible than the first ; the same nervous movements were repeated , and the mouth contracted and turned purple . and at the third she expired . at the end of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus ; you confirmed my opinion . yes , before others , replied the doctor ; but now we are alone what are you going to say ?: 93.49
<S> the host obeyed .: 22.15
<S> how delighted i am to have found you !: 52.67
<S> this village , constructed in a singular and picturesque manner , half <UNK> , half spanish , still remains , and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers , who speak the language of their fathers .: 200.72
<S> to the smaller . i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen . well , what has happened to them ? they were pursued by eight of the light dragoons , who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate . eight ! said aramis ; it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and d artagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men . the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of italians in the king s service , who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers . arrested , were they ? inquired athos ; is it known why ? no , sir , they were carried off instantly , and had not even time to tell me why ; but as soon as they were gone i found this broken sword blade , as i was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones . tis still a consolation that they were not wounded , said aramis .: 88.48
<S> i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world , and the gentleman , who was only a knight of the legion of honor , was made an officer . come , said monte cristo , this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded .: 56.06
<S> speak , then , without reserve , as without hatred ; tell the truth , the whole truth ; i do not know , never may know , the persons of whom you are about to speak ; besides , i am an italian , and not a frenchman , and belong to god , and not to man , and i shall shortly retire to my convent , which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man . this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage .: 63.30
<S> look at it , said the abbe with a smile .: 10.71
<S> bah ! said danglars , a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love .: 76.94
<S> had you , then , that sum ? the queen s famous diamond , answered d artagnan , with a sigh .: 28.74
<S> on entering the hotel d artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire .: 25.97
<S> no , my lord ; he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if i landed you safe and sound at boulogne or any other port you choose in france . what do you think of all this ? said athos , in a low tone to d artagnan , after explaining to him in french what the sailor had said in english .: 68.11
<S> peste ! i thought you somewhat corsican , a great deal smuggler , and an excellent steward ; but i see you have other strings to your bow .: 149.28
<S> ask his lackey how often he has had to prepare lint of him . alas ! sighed bazin .: 167.48
<S> i will denounce you before men , as i have denounced you before god ; and if it be necessary that , like lucretia , i should sign my accusation with my blood , i will sign it . ah ! said my enemy , in a jeering tone , that s quite another thing .: 50.10
<S> this <UNK> of drunkenness had something frightful in it .: 250.39
<S> morrel relaxed his hold of valentine , and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain .: 108.92
<S> what passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony can not be told in words .: 96.26
<S> at the first word you dared to utter , at the first freedom to which i had to reply , i called for help . yes , yes , that is true .: 43.52
<S> yes , madame . are you ready ? i am . and his eminence , the cardinal ? has got off without any accident .: 37.42
<S> yes , my lord , replied the young man , confused .: 8.83
<S> then her hair assumed successively , under her skillful hands , all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her face .: 176.12
<S> a passport for embarkation must be obtained ; and the party must be acquainted with english in order to ask the way to london .: 109.99
<S> this woman is certainly a great liar .: 78.66
<S> till we meet again , then , dear traitor ! till we meet again , my forgetful charmer ! tomorrow , my angel ! tomorrow , flame of my life ! chapter <UNK> .: 258.11
<S> d artagnan comprehended their irresolution .: 91.20
<S> faria had dug his way through fifty feet , dante s would dig a hundred ; faria , at the age of fifty , had devoted three years to the task ; he , who was but half as old , would sacrifice six ; faria , a priest and savant , had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands <UNK> , <UNK> , or lemaire ; should a hardy sailor , an experienced <UNK> , like himself , shrink from a similar task ; should he , who had so often for mere amusement s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch , hesitate to entertain the same project ?: 202.82
<S> good !: 24.94
<S> my god !: 11.06
<S> it is a rock of almost conical form , which looks as though it had been thrust up by <UNK> force from the depth to the surface of the ocean .: 85.06
<S> lieutenant , with a promise of becoming captain . tis capital ; and pray , how did you acquire all these honors ? in the first place , gentlemen , you know that i was the means of monsieur de rochefort s escape ; well , i was very near being hung by mazarin and that made me more popular than ever . so , owing to your popularity no ; thanks to something better .: 95.39
<S> remember !: 42.70
<S> if you are not located in the united states , you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this ebook .: 10.33
<S> at this name every one looked around , for his was already a very celebrated name .: 132.76
<S> tell them to take arms , to come here , and to run !: 77.84
<S> be clear , short and precise . as for me , replied aramis , i have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputation of which i formed one went yesterday to saint germain to impose on you .: 116.52
<S> a terrible idea , however , rushed into her mind .: 25.27
<S> the two sentinels at the door still had their swords <UNK> , but they were leaning on them while they watched the game .: 111.84
<S> grimaud was walking before him with a lantern .: 29.81
<S> you are monsieur d artagnan . you see , monsieur , that you say it again . but i tell you , monsieur commissary , cried bonacieux , in his turn , there is not the least doubt about the matter .: 21.31
<S> without doubt , senor ; and you understand that they would have saved the king . to be sure , said porthos , with majestic common sense ; they were in the majority . and you think , said aramis , he will consent to appear before such a tribunal ? he will be forced to do so , smiled the spaniard .: 51.13
<S> and since he has sent for me , it is doubtless to question me on what happened there .: 70.91
<S> <UNK> ! said the count , in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant .: 21.97
<S> how fast you go !: 102.54
<S> tre ville had grasped the weak side of his master ; and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships .: 101.24
<S> and without losing a minute , thinking he saw an opening , he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry a counter en <UNK> so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring .: 291.09
<S> his heart , swelled by the intoxication of joy , felt ready to <UNK> away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love !: 368.03
<S> his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard , no matter for whom or against whom .: 201.16
<S> the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here . laporte , said the queen , suppose you put one of your sons in the king s place ; we might be off during the time . if your majesty desires it , said laporte , my sons , like myself , are at the queen s service . not at all , said d artagnan ; should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute , all would be lost . you are right , sir , always right , said anne of austria .: 43.81
<S> d artagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty <UNK> which offer consolation while they are hoped for .: 438.18
<S> the other two gentlemen were unknown to him .: 21.41
<S> what is that again ? he asked .: 15.68
<S> the maid approached planchet , whom she took for lubin , and holding out a little billet to him said , for your master . for my master ? replied planchet , astonished .: 112.07
<S> are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends ? particularly when they have still a full bottle before them , added danglars .: 60.01
<S> as for me , i can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier , and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world , i am quite sure i shall recognize selim .: 71.68
<S> i have bought them , and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts , that is , in <UNK> , where no one generally stops . that s well , said monte cristo ; i remain here a day or two arrange accordingly . as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders , baptistin opened the door : he held a letter on a silver waiter .: 108.92
<S> he found as provident a host and a fresh horse .: 181.05
<S> de cha teau renaud <UNK> . not worth speaking of ? cried cha teau renaud ; life is not worth speaking of ! that is rather too philosophical , on my word , morrel .: 122.26
<S> do you not comprehend ? no . the cha teau d if has no cemetery , and they simply throw the dead into the sea , after fastening a thirty six pound cannon ball to their feet . well ? observed the englishman as if he were slow of comprehension .: 111.63
<S> she loved villefort , and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband .: 25.14
<S> has he gone intending not to return ? undoubtedly ; at ten o clock at night his horses took him to the barrier of charenton ; there a post chaise was waiting for him he entered it with his valet de chambre , saying that he was going to fontainebleau . then what did you mean stay he left a letter for me . a letter ? yes ; read it . and the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to debray .: 73.05
<S> listen ; for ten years i dreamed each night the same dream .: 160.75
<S> but please to observe i won back the equipage , cried athos .: 184.56
<S> in a moment he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast <UNK> , as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the sun s genial influence when the cloud has passed .: 323.33
<S> and the commencement of the reign of king louis xiv . it may be easily imagined how great was our joy when , in turning over this manuscript , our last hope , we found at the twentieth page the name of athos , at the twenty seventh the name of porthos , and at the thirty first the name of aramis .: 106.43
<S> politics has made you laugh at everything , and political men have made you <UNK> everything .: 292.16
<S> on leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy , became president on the place of his uncle , embraced the cardinal s party , which did not prove want of sagacity , became chancellor , served his eminence with zeal in his hatred against the queen mother and his vengeance against anne of austria , stimulated the judges in the affair of calais , encouraged the attempts of m. de laffemas , chief <UNK> of france ; then , at length , invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal a confidence which he had so well earned he received the singular commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the queen s apartments .: 130.00
<S> then , when they had disappeared , he said with a smile , tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion . then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock , from which he had a full view of the sea , and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing , weigh anchor , and , balancing herself as gracefully as a water fowl ere it takes to the wing , set sail .: 126.30
<S> how should he be ? replied athos , whilst mounting also , seeing he was used so long to brush your hats . chapter <UNK> .: 197.12
<S> next morning d artagnan was the first to rise .: 23.71
<S> the little light in the lodge had long been extinct .: 98.45
<S> i m afraid we are prisoners , whispered d artagnan to his friend .: 56.40
<S> no , stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water .: 142.45
<S> yes , he is young , and youth is invariably self confident .: 176.48
<S> the servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment .: 68.05
<S> anne of austria at the age of forty six .: 25.98
<S> d avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative .: 78.80
<S> a recollection of athos came into her mind .: 47.71
<S> my weapons . what weapons ? my military weapons . yes , my lord ; at any rate , i think so . make sure of it , and if they want it , have them <UNK> up .: 103.12
<S> i often think of that young man , d artagnan . strange !: 50.05
<S> i must visit him , he said , and obtain some pious grant from him . oh , you may make sure of him ; his charities alone amount to 20,000 francs a month . it is magnificent !: 81.84
<S> i told her of the scaffold ; oh , heavens , i forgot that it awaits me also !: 48.79
<S> i suspected where she was concealed .: 76.64
<S> stop a bit , said the dragoon , placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the <UNK> in the chimney , stop a bit , i am in it .: 123.16
<S> as for me , when i have no candle i can t take two steps without knocking against something . that s because you haven t served , said mousqueton .: 73.89
<S> he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature , <UNK> after a fantastic dream ; then gradually this view of the outer world , so calm , so pure , so grand , reminded him of the <UNK> of his vision , and once more awakened memory .: 184.85
<S> the next day about nine o clock in the morning , he landed at st. valery .: 30.81
<S> dragoons , swiss , guardsmen , musketeers , light horsemen , succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well , but agreed badly with the views of the four friends .: 167.21
<S> this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor .: 193.06
<S> then he had been seized upon by danglars , who , with a rapid glance at the stiff <UNK> old major and his modest son , and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count , made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir .: 87.50
<S> d artagnan and porthos , armed with their swords , and athos and aramis , each carrying a concealed poniard , approached the house which for the time being was charles stuart s prison .: 91.02
<S> d artagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods .: 55.13
<S> monsieur , said athos , i have engaged two of my friends as seconds ; but these two friends are not yet come , at which i am astonished , as it is not at all their custom . i have no seconds on my part , monsieur , said d artagnan ; for having only arrived yesterday in paris , i as yet know no one but monsieur de tre ville , to whom i was recommended by my father , who has the honor to be , in some degree , one of his friends . athos reflected for an instant .: 36.69
<S> bonacieux had declared to him , by all the gods , that she did not know aramis ; and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion , he found her hanging on the arm of aramis .: 38.26
<S> this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances ; nevertheless , i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangement something , in fact , more than is apparent on a <UNK> view of the subject .: 221.83
<S> now , as these street arabs of rome , more fortunate than those of paris , understand every language , more especially the french , they heard the traveller order an apartment , a dinner , and finally inquire the way to the house of thomson french .: 132.01
<S> we need no proofs ; everything relating to this young man is true . a dull , gloomy silence , like that which precedes some awful <UNK> of nature , pervaded the assembly , who shuddered in dismay .: 170.98
<S> well , be assured , added he , with the familiarity of a gascon , you shall not wait long . and he bowed in order to retire , and as if he considered the future in his own hands .: 28.35
<S> he leaped with planchet into the boat , and five minutes after they were on board .: 40.53
<S> ah , believe me , edmond , as i told you , i too have suffered much ; i repeat , it is melancholy to pass one s life without having one joy to recall , without preserving a single hope ; but that proves that all is not yet over .: 74.31
<S> d artagnan , then , remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility , till he came to this unlucky city of meung .: 93.25
<S> mother and son chapter <UNK> .: 134.79
<S> an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur .: 45.03
<S> in the farthest angle of the second opening , said the cardinal s will .: 78.63
<S> now , then , were a conspirator to fall into your hands , he would be most welcome . for my part , dear mother , interposed rene e , i trust your wishes will not prosper , and that providence will only permit petty offenders , poor debtors , and miserable <UNK> to fall into m. de villefort s hands , then i shall be contented . just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for <UNK> , <UNK> , and the <UNK> of <UNK> , or any other slight affection of the <UNK> .: 154.85
<S> both had recently come into the country .: 179.57
<S> come , it is worth thinking about ? for fifteen thousand francs ? yes . sir , you alarm me . nonsense . sir , you are tempting me ? just so ; fifteen thousand francs , do you understand ? sir , let me see my right hand correspondent . on the contrary , do not look at him , but at this . what is it ? what ?: 38.52
<S> aim at this command the mountain of populace <UNK> so suddenly that d artagnan could not repress a burst of <UNK> laughter .: 337.39
<S> adieu , gentlemen ! and remounting his horse , which cahusac led to him , he saluted them with his hand , and rode away .: 48.94
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> now , monsieur de vallon , said mazarin , what service do you prefer , in the town or in the country ? porthos opened his mouth to reply .: 49.78
<S> an unknown person had been with him that morning , and made an appointment with him in the rue saint jacques ; unfortunately , the general s valet , who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered , heard the street mentioned , but did not catch the number . as the police minister related this to the king , villefort , who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker s lips , turned alternately red and pale .: 95.39
<S> the two men were left alone .: 16.79
<S> we hear from yanina chapter <UNK> .: 171.67
<S> he was charming .: 24.04
<S> a carriage was in waiting .: 25.40
<S> yes , and i will tell you .: 10.03
<S> i do not know whether the wine of <UNK> produces melancholy , but certainly everything appears to me black in this house , said debray .: 116.97
<S> i know that name a son of monsieur de broussel s servant , and a lad that , i promise you , in a revolt will not give away his share to the dogs . is he not a singing boy at notre dame ? asked d artagnan .: 71.92
<S> it is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the way . if we have no news of them this evening , to morrow we must start . athos nodded <UNK> , then turning : and monsieur de bragelonne , a young man fifteen years of age , attached to the prince de conde has he the honor of being known to you ? <UNK> in allowing the sarcastic aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings .: 102.93
<S> the four seamen , who composed the crew , obeyed , while the pilot looked on .: 105.86
<S> be pleased to give me that scrap of paper so that i may justify , by a pretext at least , my abandoning my countrymen .: 156.13
<S> yes , she said , at your advice i have made the trial . and have you succeeded ? i think so . madame danglars was carried into the adjoining room ; monte cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips ; she returned to consciousness .: 34.60
<S> go in whatever guise you choose ; for my part , i shall go unarmed . no , for i will not allow you to do so .: 58.86
<S> the ground is soaking wet ; yet i fancy , as thou <UNK> , that i see something . at this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear , coming through darkness and space .: 167.44
<S> for the assassination itself i had never felt any remorse .: 122.86
<S> i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor . well , then , if you did , depend upon it , fernand picked it up , and either copied it or caused it to be copied ; perhaps , even , he did not take the trouble of <UNK> it .: 73.32
<S> in the street of saint <UNK> du louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by the name of quinze <UNK> .: 223.82
<S> milady breathed again .: 52.21
<S> i will not make a confidant of him . alas ! said valentine , i see that i have given you pain .: 22.16
<S> this noble gentleman with his lofty glance , this handsome cavalier , so brilliant in feats of arms that every one was surprised that he held in his hand a sword only instead of a baton of command !: 193.26
<S> this promise completed poor kitty s consolation .: 383.15
<S> as luigi spoke thus , he left her .: 49.44
<S> but i am sure of one thing that those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time . here goes the barony . said the queen ; she signed a patent .: 97.25
<S> but if it is a woman who writes , said aramis , and that woman desires not to be seen , remember , you compromise her , d artagnan ; which is not the part of a gentleman . we will remain in the background , said porthos , and he will advance alone . yes ; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop . bah ! said d artagnan , they will miss me ; if they fire we will ride after the carriage , and exterminate those who may be in it .: 66.31
<S> all these cloaks , gray or black , were raised behind by the point of a sword , or before by the barrel of an <UNK> or a musket .: 97.55
<S> exactly opposite the other !: 156.32
<S> grimaud , is it thou ? grimaud signified that he was not mistaken .: 53.98
<S> one night edmond awoke suddenly , believing that he heard someone calling him .: 124.07
<S> the magistrates freely discussed their political views ; the military part of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and <UNK> , while the women commented on the divorce of <UNK> .: 772.11
<S> he turned a <UNK> toward the little group amongst which the king stood .: 133.97
<S> <UNK> !: 469.88
<S> i was just beginning the soup , and you will dine with me . oh , oh ! said d artagnan , mousqueton has not caught these bottles with his lasso .: 46.39
<S> a most <UNK> representative i shall make of all the domestic virtues don t you think so ?: 346.23
<S> he had made some difficulties about going , under pretext that he still suffered from his wound , but d artagnan had said to him : remain if you like , my dear monsieur mouston , but i warn you that paris will be burnt down to night ; upon which mousqueton had declared , without asking anything further , that he was ready to follow his master and monsieur d artagnan to the end of the world .: 50.99
<S> besides , with these men s clothes will you dress here ? certainly . shall you have time ? do not be uneasy , you little coward !: 96.76
<S> well , he said , all you have told me is perfectly true , then , and i may believe it in every particular . see , sir , replied caderousse , in this corner is a crucifix in holy wood here on this <UNK> is my wife s testament ; open this book , and i will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix .: 68.82
<S> his love , which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep , awoke again in his heart .: 103.87
<S> then how do you hope valentine will escape ? noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot .: 78.00
<S> unlike other men , who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches , the duc de beaufort , whose <UNK> courage had become a proverb , seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action .: 284.05
<S> yes , said groslow , bursting with his usual coarse laugh , i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and <UNK> . charles had heard and understood it all .: 192.97
<S> of danglars ? yes , to be sure ; must i say baron danglars ?: 67.62
<S> number 34 and number 27 chapter 16 .: 421.81
<S> where ? asked maximilian .: 17.56
<S> most assuredly , responded madame de villefort in the same tone .: 36.28
<S> ah , i see you are smiling . if you are already aware of the conversation that passed , the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security . come , what did she say ? she told me that she loved no one , said valentine ; that she disliked the idea of being married ; that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and <UNK> life ; and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune , that she might become an artist , like her friend , mademoiselle louise d armilly . ah , you see well , what does that prove ? asked valentine .: 95.81
<S> you have no money coming in on which you can rely ? none . you have exhausted every resource ? all . and in half an hour , said maximilian in a gloomy voice , our name is dishonored ! blood washes out dishonor , said morrel .: 100.22
<S> you think so , do you ? and he took his friend along the alley , where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the <UNK> , were visible .: 112.16
<S> but hold out your glass .: 85.01
<S> well , be it so ! said she .: 11.78
<S> it was intensely dark ; still ali , thanks to his wild nature , and the count , thanks doubtless to his long confinement , could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees .: 97.75
<S> it was on thursday , the abbe s reception day ; people went there in <UNK> .: 198.11
<S> i told you , on the contrary take away the prisoner , said the commissary to the two guards .: 33.08
<S> immediately several men appeared , who unharnessed the smoking horses , and put the carriage into a coach house .: 136.20
<S> what is the matter , if you please ? sir , replied mordaunt , i have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my lodging . wherefore , sir ?: 39.67
<S> gue mene was reading aloud , and everybody was listening to her with attention with the exception of the queen , who had , on the contrary , desired this reading in order that she might be able , while feigning to listen , to pursue the thread of her own thoughts .: 72.72
<S> meanwhile , barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier , who having heard the noise in the house , had , as we have said , sent his old servant to inquire the cause ; on his return , his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger .: 76.35
<S> how pale he is ! said cha teau renaud , shuddering .: 18.74
<S> yours affectionate , de tre ville well , this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me , athos . to the waters of forges ? there or elsewhere . in the king s service ? either the king s or the queen s .: 126.60
<S> there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow , and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach , that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver .: 98.78
<S> uncertainty is worse than all . go on with the lights , said the inspector .: 70.06
<S> the footman opened the door and announced monsieur le comte de la fere .: 23.46
<S> a man of the count s temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds , but which destroys superior ones .: 186.79
<S> valentine , said the count , summon up all your courage ; still the beatings of your heart ; do not let a sound escape you , and <UNK> to be asleep ; then you will see . valentine seized the count s hand .: 56.38
<S> look , my lord cardinal , said aramis , would it not have been a pity to have separated men who love each other as we love ?: 52.03
<S> his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen .: 154.37
<S> they carried valentine away ; she had revived , but could scarcely move or speak , so shaken was her frame by the attack .: 149.38
<S> and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness , such as franz had never before witnessed in them ; his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity .: 152.62
<S> well , said she , you see he refuses ? yes ; but why need this annoy you ? you know , albert , women are singular creatures .: 59.50
<S> you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier ? i did not recognize the chevalier in armor , sir ! said raoul , blushing ; though i might have known him by his skill and coolness in danger . thank you for the compliment , my young friend , replied aramis , we can see from whom you learned courtesy .: 82.17
<S> the streets were crowded , for it was the day of pentecost , and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers ; one as fresh as if he had come out of a <UNK> , the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle .: 71.39
<S> in the midst of her despair , a new affliction overtook her .: 51.33
<S> you don t do your work by halves .: 114.25
<S> thus i was able , thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces , to intercept two couriers from mazarin to the queen . mazarin listened intently .: 132.49
<S> is it not some bad affair ? you are mistaken , planchet , replied d artagnan ; and as a proof , there is a crown to drink my health . i am much obliged to monsieur for the crown he has given me , and i promise him to follow his instructions exactly ; but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into shut up houses fall from heaven , my friend , fall from heaven . then monsieur is satisfied ? asked planchet .: 64.27
<S> here , father , here ! he said , take this take it , and send for something immediately . and he emptied his pockets on the table , the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces , five or six five franc pieces , and some smaller coin .: 78.42
<S> all england is tired of your iniquities ; my lord , you have abused the royal power , which you have almost usurped ; my lord , you are held in horror by god and men .: 105.85
<S> on their part the musketeers , who had not much to do with the siege , were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life .: 83.62
<S> who could these men be ?: 87.43
<S> both were addressed to king charles .: 156.78
<S> we are looking for the house of monsieur de la fere , said d artagnan .: 10.70
<S> fie ! pardon , my dear aramis , but i thought you carried your eyes higher . higher ?: 142.99
<S> d artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone ; and in a few minutes cahusac fell , with a sword thrust through his throat .: 53.18
<S> we should look like the two sons of <UNK> , who had lost their brother .: 98.80
<S> the challenge chapter <UNK> .: 93.25
<S> coquenard did not seem to observe it .: 41.99
<S> so i think ; and therefore i said , were our object money only ; but we want something else , replied the gascon .: 81.35
<S> i can not recollect whether it was by steel or by poison ; only of this i am sure , i have dreamed he was dead , and you know my dreams never deceive me .: 59.92
<S> but dress me as well as you are able , only make haste ; think , my dear girl , it s life and death ! kitty was but too well aware of that .: 62.83
<S> when groslow <UNK> this kind of thing there s no need to go over the ground a second time . ah !: 214.78
<S> well , yes ; you have to know me yet .: 33.31
<S> now , my dear guitant , i have often remarked that in addition to your courage , which is <UNK> , and your fidelity , which is invincible , you possess an admirable memory . you have found that out , have you , my lord ?: 59.89
<S> what with d artagnan , grimaud and mousqueton , we can manage to dispatch eight of them .: 76.47
<S> nonsense ! cried d artagnan , i can manage so that her majesty will receive me well ; i know an excellent method . what ? i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted . and then ? asked mazarin , turning pale .: 49.08
<S> next moment the door opened and the man disappeared . the scoundrel ! said aramis .: 59.22
<S> in short , his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes , and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs , while the rest of the rigid and marble like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation .: 170.21
<S> now victory has abandoned him .: 445.93
<S> the scaffold will be ready by to morrow , but the headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after to morrow . what then ? said the king .: 37.27
<S> when you pay me a visit in my cell , my young friend , said he , i will show you an entire work , the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life ; many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome , at the foot of st. mark s column at venice , and on the borders of the <UNK> at florence , little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the cha teau d if .: 60.03
<S> but listen to me , then , resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience .: 58.00
<S> it was a dark night .: 19.60
<S> it was even , according to our present manners , something like an infamous action ; but at that period people did not manage affairs as they do today .: 138.10
<S> go , then , and find them . what shall i say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence ? you know them better than i .: 55.90
<S> you can not be speaking seriously , athos ! said he ; the king is surrounded by an army , which is conducting him to london .: 40.43
<S> the old father and merce de s remained for some time apart , each absorbed in grief ; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes , and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other s arms .: 92.92
<S> if anyone comes , call me . i will , lieutenant , said the soldier .: 38.34
<S> do you know his house at auteuil ? certainly . what do you know respecting it ? do you wish to know why he bought it ? yes . the count is a speculator , who will certainly ruin himself in experiments .: 39.10
<S> nothing at least personally , said monte cristo .: 27.71
<S> at eight o clock all were in their places , and m. de morcerf entered at the last stroke .: 30.71
<S> on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen , who looked with anxiety at the stranger .: 66.08
<S> what s the manner ? cried athos .: 18.73
<S> the count continued : i have given him renewed life and hope , in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years . the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety .: 49.71
<S> well , my lord , i sew up the paper in the ball and you , in your game of tennis , will send the ball into the ditch . but will it not be lost ? oh no ; there will be some one at hand to pick it up . a gardener ? grimaud nodded .: 65.62
<S> i have no influence with any one .: 33.51
<S> is he a deputy ? oh , no .: 35.12
<S> you , he said , you , who are so trusting , read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see . athos took the letter , frowning , but an idea that he should find something in this letter about d artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it .: 90.74
<S> it is my turn to be of use to her ; do not envy me this happiness . comminges bowed and left .: 66.10
<S> you will excuse this poor fellow , madame , he said , as he preceded the baroness , but his orders are precise , and m. de villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise . in the court showing his merchandise , was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions .: 54.42
<S> de flamarens and de chatillon continued on their way and athos and aramis dismounted .: 87.68
<S> punctuality !: 218.20
<S> now , gentlemen , said the king in his turn , excited by this sight , come , gentlemen , sword in hand ! but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king s example .: 46.71
<S> then gloom settled heavily upon him .: 455.36
<S> i do nothing without her commands pray understand that ; not like monsieur de richelieu , who went on just as he pleased .: 132.17
<S> this was a terrible moment for the fugitives .: 42.12
<S> i shall know about that soon , for i shall soon speak out to athos . day was now advanced ; all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened , one after the other .: 106.82
<S> whatever you say . sir , replied the englishman , laughing , i am like my house , and do not do such things no , the commission i ask is quite different . name it , sir , i beg . you are the inspector of prisons ? i have been so these fourteen years . you keep the <UNK> of entries and <UNK> ? i do . to these <UNK> there are added notes relative to the prisoners ? there are special reports on every prisoner . well , sir , i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an abbe , who disappeared suddenly .: 111.91
<S> well , young man , said he , we appear to pass rather gay nights !: 62.87
<S> coquenard had seen everything .: 92.86
<S> remember , it is you who have ruined me ! yes , yes , to be sure , kitty , said d artagnan ; be at ease , my girl .: 25.08
<S> the executioner then took off his red cloak , spread it upon the ground , laid the body in it , threw in the head , tied all up by the four corners , lifted it on his back , and entered the boat again .: 66.76
<S> at last he determined to discover the cause of this stillness .: 49.50
<S> there , after a few days , if you like , the civil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or ceremony .: 108.51
<S> have pity on me , and do for me what i am unable to do for myself . as dante s his eyes turned in the direction of the cha teau d if uttered this prayer , he saw off the farther point of the island of <UNK> gue a small vessel with <UNK> sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey ; and with his sailor s eye he knew it to be a genoese tartan .: 112.42
<S> morrel was <UNK> to his wife , more affectionate to his daughter , than he had ever been .: 55.40
<S> on his side d artagnan became more cautious also .: 84.66
<S> do you think i love you ? said monte cristo , taking the young man s hand affectionately in his .: 18.87
<S> d artagnan turned to look at his friends .: 16.13
<S> his eminence can not see the letter without the bearer of it , replied the young man ; but to convince you that i am really the bearer of a letter , see , here it is ; and kindly add , continued he , that i am not a simple messenger , but an envoy extraordinary . bernouin re entered the cabinet , returning in a few seconds .: 61.23
<S> they were innumerable .: 113.65
<S> ah ! said the king , we shall soon see whether my highlanders have betrayed me or not . what are you going to do ? exclaimed athos .: 29.05
<S> he said nothing ; but when i went out he followed , and quickly came up with me .: 42.79
<S> well , never mind that , neighbor caderousse ; it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that .: 57.59
<S> i swear to you , sir , should any harm befall me , your name will be the last name that i shall utter , the remembrance of you my last thought . athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion , and regained with hurried steps the porch where olivain was waiting with the horses .: 101.98
<S> hey ? said the cardinal , opening the door .: 16.41
<S> go , and take this key with you ; you are active , vigorous , and you have arms .: 61.90
<S> yes , said milady .: 8.90
<S> what , monsieur ? i have a miraculous balsam for wounds a balsam given to me by my mother and of which i have made a trial upon myself . well ? well , i am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure you ; and at the end of three days , when you would be cured well , sir , it would still do me a great honor to be your man . d artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy , without throwing the least doubt upon his courage .: 63.23
<S> what more could the most devoted lover desire ? then he murmured the words of the english poet , <UNK> , thy name is woman . six months afterwards , continued caderousse , the marriage took place in the church of accoules . the very church in which she was to have married edmond , murmured the priest ; there was only a change of <UNK> . well , merce de s was married , proceeded caderousse ; but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm , she nearly fainted as she passed la re serve , where , eighteen months before , the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved , had she looked to the bottom of her heart .: 96.55
<S> arrest them . ah !: 65.12
<S> then he took milady in his arms , and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken .: 43.41
<S> here , sir , said a voice behind him .: 15.82
<S> as he was finishing this work , the sound of horses prancing in the yard , and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window , attracted his attention .: 85.39
<S> then draw down your hat , sire , that he may not discover the substitution . ah ! said athos , how much time we have lost . now , said the king , give the word and let us start . will you not give it , sire ? asked athos .: 35.57
<S> aramis obeyed .: 36.13
<S> i have addressed my people and i have spoken to god ; last of all i speak to you .: 53.21
<S> and could you not stop your fatal career , if you did not do evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it ?: 128.12
<S> what is he doing ?: 14.37
<S> he then motioned to his wife to take leave .: 27.84
<S> say the devil ! my dear friend , said d artagnan , if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar , and we will see if the mischief is as great as you say . oh , gentlemen , said the host , i have been wrong .: 31.00
<S> the troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings .: 173.19
<S> where is he ? ill very ill , say you ?: 85.11
<S> good god , cried kitty , there is my mistress calling me !: 41.80
<S> the island was utterly deserted , and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away ; his treasure was just as he had left it .: 61.63
<S> he delayed presenting himself at morrel s , but the owner , hearing of his arrival , went to see him .: 61.56
<S> the ambassadors .: 117.82
<S> sir monk , said he , whether he is now or has been an executioner , this unfortunate being is none the less a man .: 105.18
<S> each of these little <UNK> arrows must have pleased my father , added albert with a laugh .: 203.19
<S> return to greenwich and bring them here .: 105.87
<S> the marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the quay .: 102.65
<S> then , resuming his mild air , you are deceived , gentlemen , said he , this handkerchief is not mine , and i can not fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you ; and as a proof of what i say , here is mine in my pocket . so saying , he pulled out his own handkerchief , likewise a very elegant handkerchief , and of fine cambric though cambric was dear at the period but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms , only ornamented with a single cipher , that of its proprietor .: 90.69
<S> as the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve , he had made a party with porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated near the stables of the luxembourg .: 94.46
<S> she is there , said he .: 13.96
<S> you must have discovered a mine , or else become a <UNK> . so that , as you confess , you are jealous ? no , i am pleased so pleased that i wished to congratulate you ; but as i am not quite properly dressed , i chose my opportunity , that i might not compromise you . yes , and a fine opportunity you have chosen ! exclaimed andrea ; you speak to me before my servant . how can i help that , my boy ?: 62.31
<S> are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us ?: 82.59
<S> d artagnan then only half lied , which is lying but little , when he said that by going in search of milady he at the same time went in search of constance .: 102.25
<S> thanks for your devotedness , gentlemen .: 70.45
<S> d artagnan , following the strange custom of the times , considered himself at paris as on a campaign , neither more nor less than if he had been in flanders spain yonder , woman here .: 169.11
<S> in this list there were three conditions which displeased mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them . ah , ha , ha ! laughed the three friends , not a bad bargain ; and there was no fear of being taken at his word ; what did the prince do then ? the prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to mazarin , begging him never to write to him again , and offered twenty thousand francs more , on condition that he would never speak to him .: 88.82
<S> then , replied m. de villefort , have the kindness to wait half an hour ; valentine shall come down into the drawing room .: 29.57
<S> here are five francs for his trouble . indeed , said louise , i admire you , and i could almost say respect you . the laundress looked on in astonishment , but as she had been promised twenty louis , she made no remark .: 76.85
<S> the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held ; it bore no signature , but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o clock .: 67.27
<S> he has faith in himself ; he has faith in his friends ; he wishes also to have faith in his queen .: 88.67
<S> but not being able to stifle her , she smiled upon her .: 46.38
<S> what to me were all the treasures in the world , or all the kings of the earth !: 45.83
<S> d artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet , then returned to athos s , and according to custom , related everything to him .: 68.23
<S> the two interlocutors thus separated , taking opposite directions , at full gallop .: 169.60
<S> is not a day divided into twenty four hours , each hour into sixty minutes , and every minute sub divided into sixty seconds ?: 334.38
<S> and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green ? oh , that coat is not his own idea ; it is the <UNK> s , which deputed <UNK> to devise a uniform for the <UNK> . indeed ? said monte cristo ; so this gentleman is an academician ? within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly . and what is his especial talent ? his talent ?: 130.90
<S> it may be imagined that d artagnan listened to these details with increasing interest ; before grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to aramis s ear , and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement : chevalier , he said , get up and don t make the least noise . aramis awoke .: 63.96
<S> ah , then , you wish to ask advice of me ? yes ; i do wish to ask your advice , said madame danglars with anxious expectation .: 40.43
<S> then have a care , i repeat , for you seek to persuade me , and if you succeed i should lose my reason , for i should hope that i could again behold valentine . the count smiled .: 44.55
<S> the night gradually drew on , and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue .: 141.39
<S> it is done , cried she , wiping away her tears , and resuming her firmness , i am resolved not to die of remorse , but rather of shame .: 49.10
<S> the king and his escort were no longer there .: 25.42
<S> then , as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue , which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner , athos and aramis dragged the king from the <UNK> assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured , and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent .: 163.25
<S> saint denis .: 67.77
<S> at last , about ten o clock , and just as dante s began to despair , steps were heard in the corridor , a key turned in the lock , the bolts creaked , the massy oaken door flew open , and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment .: 96.21
<S> at half past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant , who had the <UNK> of the little apartment , and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour .: 53.58
<S> but hark !: 94.70
<S> as they entered the circle , the bandits could perceive , by the firelight , the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of diavolaccio .: 72.90
<S> you must be satan ! cried she .: 41.80
<S> alas , yes . well , then , instead of <UNK> me , you would do much better to assist me in avenging myself on your mistress . and what sort of revenge would you take ? i would triumph over her , and <UNK> my rival . i will never help you in that , monsieur chevalier , said kitty , warmly .: 59.72
<S> ghosts at first sight , the exterior of the house at auteuil gave no <UNK> of splendor , nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent count of monte cristo ; but this simplicity was according to the will of its master , who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside .: 130.56
<S> never ! said d artagnan .: 9.25
<S> we shall be carried in triumph . in fact , as we have said , the whole camp was in motion .: 32.87
<S> his reserve , his <UNK> , and his silence made almost an old man of him .: 137.28
<S> the guards retired ; the room resumed its obscurity .: 140.63
<S> thus , in all their dreams , their wishes , and their conversations , vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel , general of an army , or governor of a province .: 119.79
<S> then in the long days on board ship , when the vessel , gliding on with security over the azure sea , required no care but the hand of the helmsman , thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails , edmond , with a <UNK> in his hand , became the <UNK> of jacopo , as the poor abbe faria had been his tutor .: 156.63
<S> no , no , she answered , i would rather remain here . are you really frightened , madame ? said monte cristo .: 20.92
<S> come , come , fernand , said caderousse , hold up your head , and answer us .: 25.09
<S> i wish , he said , with his cunning smile , to prevent them from being ungrateful to me . it is but christian charity , replied d artagnan , not to lead one s neighbors into temptation . it is exactly for that reason , said mazarin , that i wish to start before them . d artagnan smiled he was just the man to understand the astute italian .: 59.23
<S> he had a haughty bearing , a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial .: 492.98
<S> the devil !: 10.10
<S> this way light us downstairs bernouin . the valet held a wax light ; the cardinal took a key from his bureau and opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the palais royal .: 117.44
<S> good morning , emmanuel ; you will come with me then , maximilian ? did you doubt it ? said the young captain .: 25.39
<S> nevertheless it was plain the letter came from milady .: 88.69
<S> he hoped , by means of loyal excuses , to make a friend of athos , whose lordly air and austere bearing pleased him much .: 199.09
<S> milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital ; but she would not spare him a single pang .: 140.12
<S> there he saw the grand marshal , who charged him with an <UNK> message to a bonapartist in paris , whose name i could not extract from him ; but this mission was to prepare men s minds for a return it is the man who says this , sire a return which will soon occur . and where is this man ? in prison , sire . and the matter seems serious to you ? so serious , sire , that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival , on the very day of my betrothal , i left my bride and friends , <UNK> everything , that i might hasten to lay at your majesty s feet the fears which impressed me , and the assurance of my devotion . true , said louis xviii. , was there not a marriage engagement between you and mademoiselle de saint me ran ? daughter of one of your majesty s most faithful servants . yes , yes ; but let us talk of this plot , m. de villefort . sire , i fear it is more than a plot ; i fear it is a conspiracy . a conspiracy in these times , said louis xviii. , smiling , is a thing very easy to meditate , but more difficult to conduct to an end , inasmuch as , re established so recently on the throne of our ancestors , we have our eyes open at once upon the past , the present , and the future .: 84.42
<S> well , now , she said , let us see what you would do to prove this love of which you speak . all that could be required of me .: 27.56
<S> he darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey .: 176.55
<S> porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a pistol from their <UNK> and cocked it in their turn .: 110.68
<S> for shame !: 84.84
<S> alas , to many the path is traced by tears . sir , said madame danglars , you can feel for my emotion , can you not ?: 77.86
<S> mon dieu ! said the woman , crossing herself .: 27.75
<S> i wish to tell him to make my child happy ; i wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey me ; in fact , i will know him i will ! continued the old lady , with a fearful expression , that i may rise from the depths of my grave to find him , if he should not fulfil his duty ! madame , said villefort , you must lay aside these exalted ideas , which almost assume the appearance of madness .: 57.17
<S> ha , ha , said cha teau renaud , here come some friends of yours , viscount !: 37.57
<S> i feel my head a little confused ; i will take a turn in the garden . go ; and where shall i find you ? here , in an hour . here , in an hour .: 37.12
<S> where is the letter you speak of ?: 16.55
<S> where ? asked porthos , filling a second glass of wine .: 30.19
<S> is the count shooting in the gallery ? said morcerf .: 58.89
<S> yes , returned aramis .: 11.95
<S> now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat , <UNK> by six or eight men , who have surprised and plundered it , some dark and stormy night , near some desert and gloomy island , as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest . but , asked franz , who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat , why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french , sardinian , or tuscan governments ? why ? said gaetano with a smile .: 154.13
<S> at the first swallow , it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the morning .: 42.84
<S> i shall be with mine under the third .: 66.26
<S> perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier , but as a gentleman , i say that you are very culpable . d artagnan was <UNK> the stalk of a flower , unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable ; for when turned from the eyes of athos he encountered those of aramis .: 80.76
<S> the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices one deep whisper intimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred ; all eyes , all thoughts , were occupied with the young and beautiful woman , whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle .: 341.13
<S> the two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first , then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example .: 86.53
<S> in that case you must be horribly bored , and have my sympathy . the fact is , i look to my turn for keeping guard with horror .: 83.58
<S> in heaven s name ! cried the unhappy young man , if you doubt me , question me ; i will answer you . villefort made a violent effort , and in a tone he strove to render firm : sir , said he , i am no longer able , as i had hoped , to restore you immediately to liberty ; before doing so , i must consult the trial justice ; what my own feeling is you already know . oh , monsieur , cried dante s , you have been rather a friend than a judge . <UNK> well , i must detain you some time longer , but i will strive to make it as short as possible .: 53.96
<S> you shall take him with you there .: 59.38
<S> yes , continued morrel , death had entered that house twice within one month . and what did the doctor answer ? asked monte cristo .: 49.71
<S> dante s uttered a cry of joy and surprise ; never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success .: 64.41
<S> we have only the vulture to deal with .: 79.35
<S> the other room near the library was a bedroom .: 90.39
<S> what object , think you , have this expedition to re and this league with the protestants of la rochelle which i am projecting ?: 230.35
<S> andrea felt his heart leap with joy .: 43.38
<S> if you can guess the position of the island in the darkness , you will see that the fire can not be seen from the side or from pianosa , but only from the sea . you think , then , this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors ? that is what we must find out , returned gaetano , fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star .: 79.43
<S> holloa !: 54.79
<S> come , cheer up ; is there anything that i can do for you ? i wish to see the governor . i have already told you it was impossible . why so ? because it is against prison rules , and prisoners must not even ask for it . what is allowed , then ? better fare , if you pay for it , books , and leave to walk about . i do not want books , i am satisfied with my food , and do not care to walk about ; but i wish to see the governor . if you worry me by repeating the same thing , i will not bring you any more to eat . well , then , said edmond , if you do not , i shall die of hunger that is all . the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die ; and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer , he replied in a more subdued tone .: 60.34
<S> now , said he , will you come ? i am ready . milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the window .: 22.40
<S> he knew the abbe de gondy only by report .: 103.15
<S> no , it has been stolen from you . stolen ?: 78.04
<S> i was waiting for you , sir , said mordaunt , raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe .: 27.77
<S> no , returned she , but i feel some emotion on seeing , for the first time , the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation .: 64.05
<S> <UNK> <UNK> ein <UNK> , replied the prisoner .: 932.59
<S> ah , your excellency , murmured the pilot , you should not have done so ; our master will scold us for it . the young man continued to advance , following the sailors , who chose a firm footing .: 57.23
<S> where ? asked d artagnan .: 7.01
<S> now jump onto your horse , and let us overtake the carriage . this did not take long .: 88.24
<S> look closely ! the doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup , and in an instant a light cloudy <UNK> began to form at the bottom of the cup ; this <UNK> first took a blue shade , then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal , and from opal to emerald .: 199.12
<S> do you know what gave him strength ?: 67.92
<S> teresa was lively and gay , but coquettish to excess .: 238.81
<S> as a punishment for the crime i had committed , answered bertuccio .: 41.09
<S> you see i am obliged to <UNK> , in case your prosperity should cease .: 93.50
<S> do you not know these bits of paper ? bank notes ! exactly ; there are fifteen of them . and whose are they ? yours , if you like . mine ? exclaimed the man , half suffocated .: 87.45
<S> egad !: 25.42
<S> it was one of the results of mazarin s <UNK> .: 52.23
<S> these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe , and superintend her embarkation .: 95.09
<S> have you a carriage ? no . that is of no consequence ; i always have one ready , day and night . always ready ? yes .: 66.75
<S> in short , she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself , through this experiment , made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study .: 174.99
<S> i swear to you , princess , that if your reputation did not depend on precautions and if my life alone were <UNK> yes , yes !: 150.16
<S> idiot that i am , though i have been trying to find it out for five years , i never found it out . but i do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment .: 33.20
<S> although i don t despise sweet things in proper time and place , i found the supper rather light . poor fellow ! said d artagnan .: 149.11
<S> but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days . to get married ? yes , first , and then to go to paris . very good ; have what time you require , dante s .: 60.45
<S> might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them , in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe , which he could not foresee would have been so complete .: 71.67
<S> i learn this desire , or rather i suspect that you feel it ; and in order to spare you all the <UNK> of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing , i send one of my officers to meet you , i place a carriage at his orders , and he brings you hither to this castle , of which i am governor , whither i come every day , and where , in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing each other , i have prepared you a chamber .: 91.04
<S> his piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the gascon and the <UNK> countenance of porthos .: 105.53
<S> you refuse me my liberty ; god will give it me . and the abbe , casting away his coverlet , resumed his place , and continued his calculations .: 73.04
<S> he had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers , had seen mordaunt adjust the fuse ; he had heard the proverb , which mordaunt had given in french .: 93.44
<S> in order that there might be no confusion , franz wore his peasant s costume .: 94.94
<S> he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the <UNK> to hope ; then he began to doubt his own innocence , which justified in some measure the governor s belief in his mental alienation ; and then , relaxing his sentiment of pride , he addressed his <UNK> , not to god , but to man .: 196.67
<S> we must go and look for them . all right , said athos .: 21.53
<S> faith !: 32.97
<S> do , said aramis .: 27.60
<S> but it is your real name i want to know , in the midst of your hundred names , that i may pronounce it when we meet to fight , at the moment when i plunge my sword through your heart . the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale ; his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire .: 49.22
<S> she was dressed , that is to say , in <UNK> , wrapped in a long , warm dressing gown .: 80.06
<S> m. danglars , surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue , was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry .: 168.27
<S> our former life , has it still no attractions for you ?: 197.80
<S> what the deuce can you expect ?: 103.62
<S> breathing that sea breeze , so much more <UNK> and <UNK> as the land is approached , contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy , all the power of that army which she was to combat alone she , a woman with a few bags of gold milady compared herself mentally to judith , the terrible <UNK> , when she penetrated the camp of the <UNK> and beheld the enormous mass of <UNK> , horses , men , and arms , which a gesture of her hand was to <UNK> like a cloud of smoke .: 283.69
<S> he was standing , his arms folded , near rita , who was still insensible .: 61.15
<S> tell me what i am to do for this . a very easy thing , if your horse isn t tired . i tell you he ll go like the wind , only tell me which way to drive . towards the louvres . ah , i know the way you get good <UNK> rum over there . exactly so ; i merely wish to overtake one of my friends , with whom i am going to hunt tomorrow at chapelle en serval .: 109.52
<S> the drop of water chapter lxiv .: 79.23
<S> do you wish for a notary ? asked villefort .: 11.28
<S> is it to make me a captain ?: 26.30
<S> it was merce de s leaning on her son s arm and leaving the house .: 27.54
<S> at the same time he felt the duke s arms on his shoulders like two iron claws ; but instead either of calling out or defending himself , he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone : hush ! smiling as he uttered the word .: 60.52
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> they will kill him , you may be sure of it . i don t maintain the contrary , said d artagnan .: 17.09
<S> large <UNK> of silk , embroidered with flowers of gay colors , which were rather faded , fell from the wide windows ; the <UNK> of the room were simple , but in excellent taste .: 159.49
<S> i will candidly explain the reason of both , and i trust to your goodness to pardon me .: 50.01
<S> what do you mean to do with that purse ? whispered he .: 18.38
<S> i have already got up again after three <UNK> from you , i shall never rise after this fourth . count ! said d artagnan , with some degree of emotion , i struck without knowing that it was you .: 55.40
<S> and we , too , added beauchamp and cha teau renaud .: 15.59
<S> it is pleasant to have such well dressed brethren ; and those gendarmes behaved shamefully .: 455.04
<S> the countenance of old dante s brightened .: 69.75
<S> the deed , if you please , mr. notary . and he signed it rapidly , after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the <UNK> .: 105.19
<S> the lady with the black hood followed through all their <UNK> the looks of porthos , and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion , the little negro , and the maid servant .: 124.95
<S> in those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be saved . everything shall be done as you say , athos .: 40.38
<S> if there is a sentinel within the apartment , kill him without hesitation .: 93.33
<S> this was granted .: 39.34
<S> there is your money , half in bank notes , the other half in checks payable to bearer .: 189.28
<S> at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via <UNK> .: 56.72
<S> come , gentlemen , come ! the king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him .: 27.82
<S> here s a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond . you are right , d artagnan ; i held a similar project , but as i had not nor ever shall have your fruitful , vigorous imagination , the idea was suggested to me .: 99.52
<S> for my part i am going to pay a second visit to this woman , who i fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life , and i have received orders to watch her . good ! murmured milady ; the austere puritan lies . as to the soldier , he only smiled .: 90.10
<S> it had long been an object of ambition for porthos .: 71.17
<S> madame bonacieux is lost ; so much the worse for her if she is found . no , athos , no , you are mistaken , said d artagnan ; i love my poor constance more than ever , and if i knew the place in which she is , were it at the end of the world , i would go to free her from the hands of her enemies ; but i am ignorant .: 30.89
<S> and yet , if she were a man she would attempt all this , and perhaps might succeed ; why , then , did heaven make the mistake of placing that <UNK> soul in that frail and delicate body ?: 163.62
<S> yes , sir . and it was a fierce one ? his highness the prince charged eleven times in person . he is a great commander , bragelonne . he is a hero , sir .: 68.11
<S> thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirty five years of age .: 101.42
<S> alas ! the queen ! i was going to say , there s no longer a queen .: 28.00
<S> many , also , who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris , were struck with the worthy appearance , the gentlemanly bearing , and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician , who certainly played the nobleman very well , so long as he said nothing , and made no arithmetical calculations .: 136.23
<S> and she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited felton the evening before .: 187.47
<S> you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me . come , now , said athos , you are joking . in that case , my dear friend , if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose ; the drum beats ; i observed cannon on the road ; i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville ; certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton , as the duc de chatillon said . i supposed , said athos , that last night s conferences would <UNK> those warlike arrangements . no doubt ; but they will fight , none the less , if only to mask the conferences . poor creatures ! said athos , who are going to be killed , in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him , that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort , and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal . come , come , dear athos , confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair . perhaps you speak the truth , aramis . well , let us go , then , where the fighting is , for that is the most likely place to meet with d artagnan , porthos , and possibly even raoul .: 59.82
<S> the fair <UNK> touched the great hand of porthos with her delicate fingers , smiled , made the sign of the cross , and left the church .: 73.42
<S> it will be well to prepare a light supper , of which you , athos and aramis , are not to partake athos , because i told him you had a fever ; aramis , because you are a knight of malta and won t <UNK> with fellows like us .: 91.58
<S> it frequently occurs in a state prison like this , that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners . but they believe i am shut up alone here . that makes no difference . and you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here ? i do ; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine ; only , unfortunately , i did not <UNK> aright ; for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion , instead of taking an <UNK> of forty feet , i made it fifty .: 191.78
<S> then i shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly confer . but what are your intentions ? merce de s smiled sadly .: 64.73
<S> but fernand was mistaken ; a man of his disposition never kills himself , for he constantly hopes .: 162.72
<S> not the first prince of the blood , not the king s uncle , but the base conspirator , the soul of every cabal , who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of the blood not the prince nearest to the throne , not the king s uncle , i repeat , but the murderer of chalais , of montmorency and of <UNK> mars , who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has a new adversary instead of a man who threatened , a man who smiles .: 166.14
<S> pass , replied d artagnan .: 20.90
<S> the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts , and i found myself in the house .: 172.82
<S> mother and son the count of monte cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile , and got into his carriage with maximilian and emmanuel .: 39.62
<S> if you have forgotten , as he is still living , i can write to him and he will send me information on the subject . a cold sweat burst from the brow of milady .: 30.48
<S> he shall go thither . and at his return you will send him to me .: 35.60
<S> come , said d artagnan , who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations , dost thou know where athos is ? no , sir , replied planchet .: 37.50
<S> she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes .: 122.55
<S> as for me , replied athos to this recital , i am quite at my ease ; it will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit . handsome , well bred , noble lord as you are , my dear athos , neither princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous <UNK> . how young this d artagnan is ! said athos , shrugging his shoulders ; and he made a sign to grimaud to bring another bottle .: 79.73
<S> i rang for a light , but , as no one came , i determined to find one for myself .: 46.30
<S> and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given , betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived , for the first time , that the mandate was addressed to them .: 65.60
<S> have you forgotten , my lord , that it is he who answered for me to the queen ? since then monsieur de beaufort has become an enemy of the state . that may be , my lord ; but since i am neither king nor queen nor minister , he is not my enemy and i can not accept your offer . this , then , is what you call devotion !: 44.58
<S> the french army held all between pont a <UNK> as far as valenciennes , falling back upon <UNK> .: 733.57
<S> now , how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter ? you are right ; it was left on board . then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio ? no . and what did you do with this same letter while returning from porto ferrajo to the vessel ? i carried it in my hand . so that when you went on board the pharaon , everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand ? yes . danglars , as well as the rest ? danglars , as well as others . now , listen to me , and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest .: 88.72
<S> pardieu , resumed the latter , twisting his mustache , look at me as long as you like , my little gentleman !: 40.76
<S> be it so , then , my father , he said , extending his hand to morrel , die in peace , my father ; i will live . morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son , but maximilian caught him in his arms , and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment .: 32.69
<S> oh , no , he exclaimed not die now , after having lived and suffered so long and so much !: 73.76
<S> paris , you can understand , is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor , and the police have made inquiries . well , well !: 74.18
<S> and your two other friends ? he asked .: 34.24
<S> morrel reddened , for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics ; besides , what dante s had told him of his interview with the grand marshal , and what the emperor had said to him , embarrassed him .: 59.97
<S> you attached great importance , then , to this postscript , my dear monsieur cavalcanti ? i must explain to you , said the major , that , fully confiding in the signature of the abbe busoni , i had not provided myself with any other funds ; so that if this resource had failed me , i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris . is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere ? said monte cristo .: 63.08
<S> you don t know him ? no . did you never see him ? yes , i have seen him , but i don t know what he calls himself . your name ? replied the commissary .: 15.57
<S> well , then you must be registered as charlotte backson . milady remained silent ; only this time it was no longer from affectation , but from terror .: 83.31
<S> bonacieux , who had sent for m. laporte in order to be reconducted to the louvre , should be running about the streets of paris at half past eleven at night , at the risk of being abducted a second time ?: 50.55
<S> meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked .: 68.77
<S> without me , you would both have died .: 81.49
<S> there will be eleven crowns gained . it is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in d artagnan s purse .: 86.88
<S> you may copy it , give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at www.gutenberg.org .: 8.75
<S> it was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger ; she <UNK> herself , <UNK> at her <UNK> and walked up and down .: 164.34
<S> a freezing politeness , a strict fidelity to government principles , a profound contempt for theories and <UNK> , a deep seated hatred of <UNK> , these were the elements of private and public life displayed by m. de villefort .: 456.54
<S> the meetings were always held from that time till midnight .: 107.07
<S> are you not , he asked , the priest who here in the cha teau d if is generally thought to be ill ? mad , you mean , don t you ? i did not like to say so , answered dante s , smiling .: 30.98
<S> you will speak in italian , said he .: 19.53
<S> what does scandal signify to me ?: 59.01
<S> in madame de villefort s room ? he murmured and slowly returned , with one hand wiping his forehead , and with the other supporting himself against the wall .: 37.22
<S> why , they want to know if the duke of buckingham is in paris , and if he has had , or is likely to have , an interview with the queen . d artagnan held onto this idea , which , from what he had heard , was not wanting in probability .: 51.02
<S> a lover is never terrible , he said .: 61.68
<S> we shall find him changed into a broken down old man , with garnet nose and eyes that <UNK> ; we shall find him extended on some lawn , whence he will look at us with a languid eye and <UNK> will not recognize us .: 211.30
<S> when d artagnan had finished , he said , hum !: 25.59
<S> he is very susceptible . bah , said debray ; he scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort ; you said so yourself . true .: 79.19
<S> although in reality a liberal , he negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x. , in 1829 , who made him a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor ; so that he wears the ribbon , not , as you would think , in his waistcoat pocket , but at his button hole . ah , interrupted morcerf , laughing , beauchamp , beauchamp , keep that for the <UNK> or the <UNK> , but spare my future father in law before me . then , turning to monte cristo , you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron ? i do not know him , returned monte cristo ; but i shall probably soon make his acquaintance , for i have a credit opened with him by the house of richard <UNK> , of london , arstein eskeles of vienna , and thomson french at rome . as he pronounced the two last names , the count glanced at maximilian morrel .: 92.98
<S> rochefort called him his friend , his dear bonacieux , and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him .: 58.01
<S> but when i have found them , then tremble , sir .: 50.88
<S> the month passed , and morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources .: 91.32
<S> d artagnan appointed eight o clock at athos s residence .: 52.60
<S> dame nanette , look for those apricots which madame de longueville sent to us yesterday from noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son , with a crust of new bread . oh , thank you , sir , thank you , monsieur broussel , said friquet ; i am so fond of apricots ! broussel then proceeded to his wife s room and asked for breakfast ; it was nine o clock .: 80.81
<S> i neither approve nor disapprove , my lord ; i merely await your commands . good ; it is you , accordingly , that i have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to saint germain . liar ! thought d artagnan .: 88.08
<S> the rendezvous the first words that albert uttered to his friend , on the following morning , contained a request that franz would accompany him on a visit to the count ; true , the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening ; but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged .: 99.88
<S> no . said villefort ; fetch the nearest . the nearest , said the district doctor , is a good italian abbe , who lives next door to you .: 127.76
<S> his room , like all those on the same floor , had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody .: 59.31
<S> but perhaps you have never loved ! child ! replied the count .: 41.69
<S> see him , and hear what he says . m .: 35.23
<S> it is five hundred feet from here , in advance , said d artagnan .: 25.84
<S> the procurator s wife took porthos into an adjoining room , and they began to lay the basis of a reconciliation .: 58.99
<S> alas , said andrea , sighing , one can not be completely happy in this world ! chapter <UNK> .: 47.55
<S> where is the man who brought the letter ? in the street . he awaits the answer ? yes . i must learn where we are going .: 41.55
<S> even before the coachman had hailed the concierge , the massy gates rolled on their hinges they had seen the count coming , and at paris , as everywhere else , he was served with the rapidity of lightning .: 137.68
<S> the cardinal pronounced the single word , hanged ! the king was invited to come and see the hanging .: 114.68
<S> bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead , and then followed them , ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of charles i. fortunately , he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion , and the young woman and the handsome musketeer entered the louvre by the wicket of the echelle without any interference .: 89.12
<S> oh , then let it be directly ! exclaimed the young man .: 20.54
<S> in five minutes it will be too late ! mme .: 25.68
<S> this time my determination is irrevocably taken .: 96.80
<S> madame de longueville is ill , said the duke , and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty . anne gave a quick glance to mazarin , who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head .: 33.93
<S> i was about to become an abbe , and all was arranged .: 27.57
<S> athos had desired blaisois to try to speak to aramis himself .: 80.14
<S> he has come ! thought milady .: 35.57
<S> i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us . i think , replied porthos , it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again ; it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way , and a failure would be <UNK> .: 85.60
<S> at that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor .: 32.81
<S> he perceived in the tavern a <UNK> boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister .: 135.03
<S> the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me ; it will be nothing more than a sign from m. <UNK> tel , or from m. <UNK> , transmitted to the prefect of bayonne , <UNK> by two greek words , te le , <UNK> .: 232.48
<S> do you know the house of thomson french ? yes , i once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200,000 francs ; but since then i have not heard it mentioned . it is one of the best houses in europe , said danglars , carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk .: 44.45
<S> a parliamentary officer , clothed in black and with a gravity that <UNK> ill , entered , bowed to the king , and <UNK> a parchment , read the sentence , as is usually done to criminals before their execution .: 239.39
<S> on the 1st , morrel returned ; he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety , for from this journey to paris they hoped great things .: 121.06
<S> d artagnan saw those tears , and much disturbed , softened , he threw himself at her feet .: 61.14
<S> why , you are <UNK> that letter into your pocket ! yes , said d artagnan , athos is right , it must be burned .: 41.13
<S> cloud .: 100.96
<S> here is what the letter contained : milady , be at the first ball at which the duke of buckingham shall be present .: 60.73
<S> have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire ? said the cardinal .: 62.89
<S> but , said mazarin , you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen . the king and the queen are my king and queen , replied the musketeer , my life is theirs and i must give it for them .: 34.30
<S> this short interval was sufficient to determine d artagnan on the part he was to take .: 49.52
<S> the cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king , with an air of <UNK> very displeasing to me , that the day before yesterday those damned musketeers , those <UNK> he dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to me those braggarts , added he , glancing at me with his tiger cat s eye , had made a riot in the rue fe rou in a cabaret , and that a party of his guards i thought he was going to laugh in my face had been forced to arrest the rioters !: 160.40
<S> will you speak ? he said .: 15.72
<S> ah , he s gone to blois ; the poor boy wherefore ? ah , to inquire after the little la valliere ; she has sprained her foot , you know . you think he has ? i am sure of it , said athos ; don t you see that raoul is in love ? indeed !: 62.32
<S> the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place , but his eyes expressed alarm , which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features .: 59.70
<S> he forgot that besides his friends of his own sex , a woman , strange to say , had remembered him .: 65.71
<S> the boat was moored to the shore , and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac ; but , doubtless , the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel , for he cried out : not that way , if you please . gaetano faltered an excuse , and advanced to the opposite side , while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way .: 121.12
<S> at the sound of the gold aramis raised his eyes and porthos started .: 40.89
<S> there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near , amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced .: 62.51
<S> ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque , drew the lasso from his pocket , threw it so skilfully as to catch the <UNK> of the near horse in its triple fold , and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock , then the animal fell over on the pole , which snapped , and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way .: 187.82
<S> very well what did i say to you ?: 20.13
<S> as for you , raoul , i am sure it is your fault , some giddiness or folly . no , sir , i assure you , muttered raoul , it is not . oh , no , no , i declare it is not ! cried the young girl , while raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her disaster .: 31.27
<S> in spite of his usual command over himself , dante s could not restrain his <UNK> .: 50.91
<S> houses were no longer to be seen ; trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another .: 207.36
<S> starting up , he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting , and exclaimed , his father !: 86.08
<S> five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister , debray had the horses put to his carriage , and drove to danglars house .: 83.00
<S> should it not be found in the possession of father or son , then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dante s on board the pharaon . but , said rene e , this letter , which , after all , is but an anonymous <UNK> , is not even addressed to you , but to the king s attorney . <UNK> true ; but that gentleman being absent , his secretary , by his orders , opened his letters ; thinking this one of importance , he sent for me , but not finding me , took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party . then the guilty person is absolutely in custody ? said the marquise .: 101.32
<S> there happened then that which you know , and of which your precipitate departure , added the host , with an acuteness that did not escape d artagnan , appeared to authorize the issue .: 131.16
<S> a vessel was setting sail for algiers , on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed .: 425.34
<S> andrea cavalcanti chapter 57 .: 81.96
<S> my name must rest unknown , replied franz ; merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure . as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer , the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire , who rose and disappeared among the rocks .: 116.53
<S> that glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of mazarin , who , reading in it a declaration of war , seized d artagnan by the arm and said : if occasion requires , monsieur , you will remember that man who has just gone out , will you not ? yes , my lord , he replied .: 46.56
<S> and aramis , said the duchess , quickly .: 26.41
<S> project gutenberg is a registered trademark .: 9.94
<S> i am quite resigned .: 34.44
<S> dante s had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore , and , instead of landing at the usual place , he dropped anchor in the little creek .: 68.04
<S> these are melancholy doings , your reverence , which always fall again upon the poor .: 204.79
<S> i scarcely thought you were so curious as that . i am always curious to see the downfall of your honor s enemies , and he was not among the least of them .: 57.94
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> the three last , returned he , with a negligence evidently unaffected , for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put .: 102.98
<S> he was not ignorant that such a beast was worth at least twenty livres ; and the words which had accompanied the present were above all price .: 119.14
<S> colonel fairfax , repeated bradshaw .: 235.76
<S> then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room , bursting with laughter .: 32.25
<S> in an hour ? inquired danglars , turning pale .: 23.88
<S> a family affair chapter <UNK> .: 117.85
<S> he says to you <UNK> , gentlemen , there is fighting going on in gascony or in flanders ; go and fight , and you go there .: 137.54
<S> we will hasten on to the inn ; you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor .: 67.33
<S> does this oath satisfy you ? yes , said they all , with one accord .: 108.44
<S> ma foi , i beg your pardon , but as i have but one son , and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him , i am still serving my apprenticeship , you know ; come , i will reform . and morcerf with a forced smile arose , and , making a low bow to m. danglars , said : baron , i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle euge nie danglars for my son , the vicomte albert de morcerf . but danglars , instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected , knit his brow , and without inviting the count , who was still standing , to take a seat , he said : monsieur , it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer . to reflect ? said morcerf , more and more astonished ; have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us ? count , said the banker , things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions , or at all events to cause us to <UNK> them according to the change of circumstances , which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them . i do not understand you , baron , said morcerf .: 68.21
<S> madame danglars uttered a scream and fainted .: 53.56
<S> d artagnan flew to his hole , laid himself down on the floor at full length , and listened .: 48.51
<S> they had not long to wait for an answer .: 25.25
<S> le blanc was not a fast animal , but he kept up an easy , steady pace ; in three hours and a half andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from compie gne , and four o clock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop .: 134.08
<S> he is calling you , said the count ; he to whom you have confided your destiny he from whom death would have separated you , calls you to him .: 83.06
<S> does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two ? asked the host .: 63.45
<S> you are going , sir ? yes , said cromwell .: 12.16
<S> the other day a banker s clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate ; yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold . caderousse was filled with wonder ; the young man s words sounded to him like metal , and he thought he could hear the rushing of <UNK> of louis .: 96.02
<S> morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him .: 50.12
<S> he had not done so for ten years before .: 27.53
<S> then they began to pass around the <UNK> , piquant , arlesian sausages , and <UNK> in their dazzling red cuirasses , <UNK> of large size and brilliant color , the <UNK> with its <UNK> outside and dainty morsel within , the <UNK> , esteemed by the <UNK> of the south as more than <UNK> the exquisite flavor of the <UNK> , north .: 671.99
<S> the cups of coffee were all prepared , with the addition of sugar , which had been brought for albert .: 67.36
<S> the evening came on , and with it darkness ; but however profound was this darkness , my eyes began to accustom themselves to it .: 108.40
<S> he was certainly the tall young man with light hair , red beard , black eyes , and brilliant complexion , whom his master had so particularly described to him .: 41.83
<S> the musketeers are , as you know , picked soldiers , and they require many things useless to the guardsmen or the swiss . but yet , detail them to me . why , they may amount to , said porthos , who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by one .: 156.86
<S> you understand that , interested as i am in this affair , i can not see it in the same light as you do .: 31.25
<S> what !: 14.83
<S> the fowl had not been poisoned she had died of apoplexy .: 83.82
<S> the coadjutor went to him and held out his hand .: 14.06
<S> de tre ville knows him and esteems him very highly , and de tre ville , as you know , is one of the queen s greatest friends .: 42.28
<S> oliver cromwell .: 41.93
<S> present arms !: 385.09
<S> as the last stroke died away , i saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended .: 72.68
<S> he is a priest , said bragelonne , he has worn the <UNK> .: 68.47
<S> and you obeyed ? father , that woman was a monster .: 52.82
<S> the dining room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left ; it was entirely of marble , with antique bas <UNK> of priceless value ; and at the four corners of this apartment , which was oblong , were four magnificent statues , having baskets in their hands .: 131.57
<S> give the lackeys money , and they will start . we will give them money ? replied athos .: 47.23
<S> sheathe your swords , gentlemen , sheathe your swords ! but it was too late .: 79.46
<S> this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement .: 187.56
<S> are all these crimes committed on his account ? ah , then you at length understand ? heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him ! valentine , you are an angel ! but why is my grandfather allowed to live ? it was considered , that you dead , the fortune would naturally revert to your brother , unless he were disinherited ; and besides , the crime appearing useless , it would be folly to commit it . and is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman ? do you recollect in the arbor of the ho tel des postes , at perugia , seeing a man in a brown cloak , whom your stepmother was questioning upon aqua tofana ?: 117.86
<S> luigi vampa s bill of fare we awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by danglars .: 221.87
<S> ah , it is jacopo , she said , the captain of the yacht ; and she beckoned him towards them .: 50.45
<S> die in peace ! and i , said m. d artagnan .: 27.63
<S> have i guards ?: 274.97
<S> he was stopped by athos .: 30.21
<S> they rose about eight o clock in the winter , about six in summer , and went to take the <UNK> and see how things went on at m. de tre ville s .: 48.10
<S> then the vessel resumed its course , still escorted by the little cutter , which sailed side by side with it , menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon .: 200.44
<S> ah , sir , indeed you would inspire me with pity , were you not hateful in my eyes . morrel yes ; you tell me to lay aside the mask , and i will do so , be satisfied !: 45.92
<S> the sign of the red dovecot meanwhile the king , who , with more reason than the cardinal , showed his hatred for buckingham , although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of re , and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle ; but notwithstanding his earnest wish , he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between mm .: 111.52
<S> disguised . it was very boldly written , if disguised . stop a bit , said the abbe , taking up what he called his pen , and , after dipping it into the ink , he wrote on a piece of prepared linen , with his left hand , the first two or three words of the accusation .: 95.32
<S> his eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand .: 184.01
<S> scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground , as if he were looking for a crown piece in the dust .: 47.14
<S> at least that will conciliate us all , said aramis .: 42.58
<S> it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise , one of the most open and strictly guarded in france ; this was quite out of the question , especially to a man like andrea , perfectly conversant with criminal matters .: 103.22
<S> do you think so , sir ? certainly .: 12.97
<S> for two days no one knew what had become of her , and everything remained in suspense ; but once free , and placed in communication with laporte , matters resumed their course , and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which , but for her arrest , would have been executed three days earlier .: 145.20
<S> everything about the count seemed to have its meaning , for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face , and even to the most trifling gesture , scarcely to be understood .: 72.75
<S> the french way of living is utterly unknown to me , and up to the present time i have followed the eastern customs , which are entirely in contrast to the parisian .: 119.55
<S> mademoiselle euge nie , said the maid , retired to her apartment with mademoiselle d armilly ; they then took tea together , after which they desired me to leave , saying that they needed me no longer . since then the maid had been below , and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room ; madame danglars , therefore , went to bed without a shadow of suspicion , and began to muse over the recent events .: 92.81
<S> well , read it ; he demands your head . <UNK> my father answered with a loud laugh , which was more frightful than even threats would have been , and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard ; he had fired them himself , and had killed two men .: 97.43
<S> as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was <UNK> by frequent <UNK> .: 124.72
<S> you provide , in accordance with paragraph 1.f.3 , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of receipt of the work .: 26.97
<S> you are the son of the <UNK> cavalcanti and the marchesa oliva corsinari .: 106.37
<S> he soon left the pathway of the patrol , descended across the rocks , and when arrived on the edge of the sea , whistled .: 54.49
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> well , you do not answer , cardinal , what do you think about it ? i am thinking , madame , of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman , whom you have caused to be arrested , to the duke of buckingham to him whom you allowed to be assassinated to the duchess de chevreuse , whom you suffered to be exiled to the duc de beaufort , whom you imprisoned ; but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which i stand to you . anne drew up , as she always did , when anything touched her pride .: 51.84
<S> your monsieur bonacieux is very tiresome . the commissary designated by the same gesture athos and bonacieux , let them be guarded more closely than ever . and yet , said athos , with his habitual calmness , if it be monsieur d artagnan who is concerned in this matter , i do not perceive how i can take his place . do as i bade you , cried the commissary , and preserve absolute secrecy .: 79.85
<S> the moon lighted the group .: 56.00
<S> oh , i can not go without taking leave of her ; i can not die without confiding her to someone . he quietly regained his seat , and wrote under the other lines : i bequeath to maximilian morrel , captain of spahis , and son of my former patron , pierre morrel , shipowner at marseilles , the sum of twenty millions , a part of which may be offered to his sister julie and brother in law emmanuel , if he does not fear this increase of fortune may <UNK> their happiness .: 89.03
<S> it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf ; and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings , he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count , consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination .: 90.46
<S> he gained the place appointed , and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence , he waited .: 61.03
<S> hi !: 89.73
<S> but , at least , tell me where he is , that i may know whether he is alive or dead , said she .: 21.09
<S> swear first , on your honor , not to inform him of our return . conditions ? why not ? because it is for <UNK> to make conditions , and you are not yet <UNK> , gentlemen . then let us draw on the spot .: 87.88
<S> no , it is not existence , then , that i regret , but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out , so laboriously framed .: 148.50
<S> devil take these civil wars !: 380.02
<S> they never buried the dead ; they merely attached a heavy cannon ball to the feet , and then threw them into the sea .: 92.63
<S> the fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then , does it not ? asked caderousse .: 53.37
<S> it was illuminated by lamps with ground glass shades which gave only a feeble light , as if out of consideration for the envoy s weak sight .: 364.59
<S> i ought not to have driven a bargain when it was to equip a cavalier like you . porthos , without reply , retreated a second step .: 70.39
<S> i expected him this morning . he desired me to tell your grace , replied felton , that he very much regretted not having that honor , but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the castle . yes , i know that , said buckingham ; he has a prisoner . it is of that prisoner that i wish to speak to your grace , replied felton .: 47.87
<S> but now we are alone , although it is immaterial to me , where are we going ? into normandy , if you like . delightful ; shall we be quite retired ?: 66.36
<S> and why presently ?: 69.43
<S> morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake .: 94.63
<S> in the meantime , i remain here .: 25.87
<S> i have seen him once , replied grimaud , a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of recollection .: 159.78
<S> d artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume .: 31.10
<S> oh , my god ! cried she , my god !: 7.13
<S> there is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys , large enough to hold all the world . your valise is then empty ? asked porthos , with simplicity .: 115.26
<S> what could i do for you , edmond , besides pray and weep ?: 68.98
<S> he immediately made a new point in advance , rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees , and placed himself across the road , about two hundred paces from the camp .: 54.78
<S> they were attired as peasants of albano , <UNK> , civita <UNK> , and <UNK> .: 576.60
<S> one only is still not in our power and braves us .: 125.51
<S> i have no right to it .: 21.59
<S> good day , commander ! ah , you know that already , said the private secretary , smiling and shaking hands with him .: 71.98
<S> you see that i can not , like you , for instance , settle on any fixed plan . thou <UNK> , <UNK> one , said d artagnan to himself .: 86.66
<S> yes , the marechal de grammont is right ; this will change the aspect of french affairs , but i much fear it will do nothing for english , even if it does not harm them .: 76.05
<S> it is not a man , then , but some angel that leaves us , and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good . say not so , quickly returned monte cristo say not so , my friends ; angels never <UNK> , celestial beings remain where they wish to be .: 153.61
<S> give him some more wine , fernand . fernand filled caderousse s glass , who , like the confirmed <UNK> he was , lifted his hand from the paper and seized the glass .: 96.19
<S> on his part , the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect .: 34.82
<S> and i again repeat , you shall not commit suicide . prevent me , then ! replied morrel , with another struggle , which , like the first , failed in releasing him from the count s iron grasp .: 90.65
<S> it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island , for , as you see , the fire is behind us . but this fire ? continued franz .: 35.06
<S> d artagnan smiled .: 9.13
<S> what are you thinking of ? asked the abbe smilingly , <UNK> the deep <UNK> in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder .: 106.75
<S> i fear that she has badly sprained her <UNK> . oh , heavens ! cried athos .: 75.75
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> yes , madame , another service , said athos , shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize him .: 37.21
<S> see !: 35.16
<S> the prisoners , in their expressive language , have named it the lions den , probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars , and sometimes the keepers also .: 471.14
<S> the baron walked triumphantly through the crowd , who for the sake of gain styled him your excellency . as danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron , he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency , and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars , who were ready , for twelve more , to call him your highness . which road ? asked the postilion in italian .: 184.76
<S> thomson french , said he ; do you know this house , monsieur ? <UNK> they are my bankers in the capital of the christian world , returned the count quietly .: 91.31
<S> why , here they give you their hand they press yours in return they keep up a whispering conversation permit you to accompany them home .: 392.08
<S> gold , a devoted friend , and a letter from the king , our husband and master . de winter bowed again , unable to reply from excess of emotion .: 80.55
<S> i am not a banker , like m. danglars , but i am quite as incredulous as he is . i am going to give you a proof , replied the count , and he rang the bell .: 18.78
<S> have you not thought so ? yes , said monte cristo ; for that reason i wished to keep you near me . it is miraculous ! continued morrel , answering his own thoughts .: 26.14
<S> he entered the hotel and ascended the front steps , and addressing a footman who waited there in a grand livery , asked if the duchess de chevreuse was visible and if she could receive the comte de la fere ?: 74.12
<S> ah , my yellow horse , cried he .: 42.71
<S> is my lord pleased with his escort ? asked d artagnan .: 37.48
<S> destiny ! murmured the abbe .: 43.22
<S> i will not sleep where i must scorn .: 69.44
<S> i embrace you with all my heart .: 21.46
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> ah ! said milady , listening in her turn to the noise of felton s steps , which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of lord de winter ; at length you are mine ! then her brow darkened .: 61.59
<S> laugh , then , said monsieur de retz ; they are looking at us . and leaving aramis he went to talk with madame de chevreuse , who was in the midst of a large group .: 31.97
<S> several persons are invited , and among others , m. danglars , your banker .: 82.30
<S> but one thing i can tell you , of which i do not think you are aware ; that is , that i have always been opposed to this marriage , and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation . noirtier regarded his daughter in law with the look of a man desiring an explanation .: 49.11
<S> is it not so ? eh , who knows ?: 27.78
<S> i have already forbidden that man , he said , to come in here without my permission . you must pardon him , my lord , said la ramee , for i directed him to come . and why did you so direct when you know that he <UNK> me ? my lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper .: 54.94
<S> meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner , as well as for those who were preparing his escape ; only for him it passed more slowly .: 102.93
<S> but listen to me , valentine , and i will tell you all about it .: 11.65
<S> i suppose , had he found another additional vertebra , they would have made him a commander . very likely , said albert .: 75.87
<S> the marechal de la meilleraie was caught between two fires , but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was .: 48.19
<S> then the cambric was torn from her beautiful shoulders ; and on one of those lovely shoulders , round and white , d artagnan recognized , with inexpressible astonishment , the fleur de lis that indelible mark which the hand of the infamous executioner had imprinted .: 167.54
<S> make room ! cried d artagnan .: 22.83
<S> decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal .: 536.40
<S> which of you gentlemen , asked the magistrate , without replying to the count , answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti ? a cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room .: 50.09
<S> all now , replied la ramee .: 17.09
<S> but putting his head out of the carriage : eh !: 46.38
<S> my sword !: 46.97
<S> what a <UNK> this would be for his majesty , who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his musketeers ! he had scarcely finished , when d artagnan made such a furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward , it is probable he would have jested for the last time .: 122.17
<S> the devil i am !: 23.31
<S> since mazarin has sent for you , it is because he wants you .: 42.12
<S> franz perceived how completely he was in his element ; and , unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt , took up albert s glass , and began in his turn to survey the audience .: 74.52
<S> d artagnan fought three times with rochefort , and wounded him three times .: 71.22
<S> since i have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master , i have been constantly seeking him , but all in vain .: 84.10
<S> send him away or you will never make a man of him . i think i shall send him to paris . so ! thought d artagnan , and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived .: 36.88
<S> there s the sun !: 30.56
<S> i would willingly have said two words to mordaunt in this little desert .: 133.28
<S> perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle ; but in the meantime we shall part good friends , i hope . yes , my lord ; but with the hope of soon becoming enemies . be satisfied ; i promise you that . i depend upon your word , my lord . d artagnan bowed to the duke , and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside .: 37.08
<S> that man has sagacity , honor and wit , not to mention likewise that he is a man of undoubted resolution .: 119.12
<S> what has happened ? all sorts of misfortunes . what ? in the first place , monsieur athos is arrested . arrested !: 60.10
<S> once within the interior of the court , the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twenty five steps .: 49.69
<S> it was mousqueton , who was obeying his master s command .: 37.50
<S> you leaned upon my arm upon this , madame !: 84.34
<S> felton would see all ; perhaps he would say nothing , but he would see .: 48.23
<S> i saw your vessel , and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island , i swam off on a piece of <UNK> to try and intercept your course .: 140.01
<S> you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money .: 261.71
<S> his noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them .: 110.09
<S> now take me aboard and return to your post , for they will soon be here . i am ready . it is important that none of your crew should see me . i have but one man on board , and i am as sure of him as i am of myself .: 45.49
<S> the earl of <UNK> , tis true , wore a splendid ring , set with diamonds , given him by his royal mistress , whilst i i have nothing but a simple <UNK> of gold , with a cipher on it and a date ; but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal , so they will never ruin me , as they long to do , and whilst they shout , down with mazarin ! i , unknown , and unperceived by them , <UNK> them to cry out , long live the duke de beaufort one day ; another , long live the prince de conde ; and again , long live the parliament ! and at this word the smile on the cardinal s lips assumed an expression of hatred , of which his mild countenance seemed incapable .: 151.34
<S> he is at the siege of la rochelle with the cardinal .: 17.03
<S> presently it sounded one o clock .: 91.88
<S> no half confidence , or you understand ! i know it from my wife , monsieur from my wife herself . who learns it from whom ? from monsieur laporte .: 131.38
<S> what , then , would be the use of all i have suffered ?: 17.79
<S> i wish to drink to the health of edmond and the lovely merce de s. you have had too much already , drunkard , said danglars ; and if you continue , you will be compelled to sleep here , because unable to stand on your legs . i ? said caderousse , rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man , i can t keep on my legs ?: 57.81
<S> what do you mean by that ? nothing , my lord ; monsieur d artagnan belongs to the service ; monsieur d artagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal , who pays him , as much as we make it ours , we citizens , to attack him , whom he robs . you are an intelligent fellow , my friend ; can we count upon you ? you may count upon me , my lord , provided you want to make a complete <UNK> of the city . tis that exactly .: 69.30
<S> porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly , and shuddered when he felt the knee of the procurator s wife under the table , as it came in search of his .: 86.20
<S> every one was impatient , la ramee to sit down to table , the guards to go and drink , the duke to escape .: 70.15
<S> once out of auteuil , andrea looked around , in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard , and then , stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man , he asked : now , tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity ? let me ask you why you deceived me ? how have i deceived you ? how , do you ask ?: 55.42
<S> the same day the will was made , the witnesses were brought , it was approved by the old man , sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to m. deschamps , the family notary .: 70.28
<S> do you speak spanish , grammont ? faith , my lord , but indifferently . and i not at all , said the prince , laughing .: 42.20
<S> no , i am wrong .: 12.84
<S> when he had once passed the massive door covered with long square headed nails , he fell into the midst of a troop of swordsmen , who crossed one another in their passage , calling out , quarreling , and playing tricks one with another .: 138.85
<S> do you know saint mandrier ? i do . in the hour of rest , between noon and one o clock galley slaves having a <UNK> after dinner !: 240.52
<S> just as they were sitting down to table , m. de monte cristo arrived .: 27.07
<S> come , let us speak of your little affairs .: 23.99
<S> at this sound , as he was already partially exposed to view , he stepped back and concealed himself completely , remaining perfectly motionless .: 147.27
<S> give me some water and ether .: 98.37
<S> do you know monsieur de rochefort ? one of my <UNK> enemies the faithful friend of cardinal richelieu . i know that , and we sent him to the bastile , said mazarin .: 34.28
<S> beware , my lord , you are in the hands of god ! in the hands of the devil , you mean ! cried buckingham , raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people , without absolutely shouting .: 42.77
<S> a glorious prize !: 126.04
<S> ah , devil take it , you speak in earnest and must have a definite answer .: 62.89
<S> give me , therefore , one more day before i invite you ; i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality . if you ask me for a day , count , i know what to anticipate ; it will not be a house i shall see , but a palace .: 59.76
<S> then monsieur de beaufort , who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal , though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal , pictured to himself , in his prison , all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister s cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria : monsieur de beaufort has escaped ! whilst saying that to himself , monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside , breathing the air of the plains and the forests , pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice , i am free ! it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls ; he saw la ramee twirling his <UNK> ten feet from him , and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante chamber .: 96.68
<S> besides , i am here in my own country , and that excites me . and both , with free use of the spur , arrived at st. omer without drawing bit .: 84.83
<S> well , my dear friend ? said he , in as pure french as has ever been uttered between rouen and tours .: 88.24
<S> like everything else , we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression , gentle or violent , sad or joyous .: 257.69
<S> what is your name , my friend ? she said .: 8.22
<S> yes , sire . and yours , monsieur d herblay ? yes , sire . as you wish , then .: 23.00
<S> the devil ! thought d artagnan .: 7.49
<S> as he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime , they came up to him with the purpose of making sure .: 77.85
<S> this morning i awoke at six o clock .: 25.44
<S> the host , fearful of consequences , with the help of his servants carried the wounded man into the kitchen , where some trifling attentions were bestowed upon him .: 75.40
<S> come and watch by the dead , and all the wretched family will be grateful to you . i am going , sir ; and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine . d avrigny took the priest s hand , and without meeting villefort , who was engaged in his study , they reached valentine s room , which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers .: 39.95
<S> do you find yourself badly lodged , sister ?: 170.16
<S> and turning with that fury which made him so formidable , he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents , a man who , with a huge sword in his hand , was trying to <UNK> a passage to the coach door through the musketeers .: 68.81
<S> athos talked of the discretion of grimaud , who never spoke a word but when his master <UNK> his mouth .: 115.82
<S> i know well that the proposition is tempting , but at present it is impossible to accept it . and why not ? said aramis , in his tone of raillery .: 29.99
<S> the name of the french officer who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our palikares ; it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor , and that it was favorable . and do you not remember the frenchman s name ? said morcerf , quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator .: 66.30
<S> this new tenant , who , as we have said , was an italian , was called il signor giacomo busoni .: 103.28
<S> it is strange , said aramis .: 9.23
<S> besides , we are in a situation to overlook ceremony . come , then , let us go to your friend s house .: 38.81
<S> those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry , long live broussel ! down with mazarin ! and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was <UNK> at , spat upon and even beaten .: 641.00
<S> the army , i will answer for it , will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police affairs . the expression was imprudent ; but m. de tre ville launched it with knowledge of his cause .: 121.55
<S> make no allusion to the past ; nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your illustrious father or ill fated mother . i have already told you , my lord , that i shall see no one . it is possible , hayde e , that so perfect a seclusion , though <UNK> with the habits and customs of the east , may not be practicable in paris .: 84.42
<S> halloo , grimaud ! grimaud appeared .: 41.99
<S> louis xiii .: 12.19
<S> nothing ! replied grimaud .: 20.53
<S> at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon .: 132.71
<S> go , and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this . charles rose and turned toward parry , whom he saw pale and with his temples <UNK> with moisture .: 194.10
<S> then i speak at random ; instead of <UNK> about the torments of hell i talk of the joys of paradise .: 229.57
<S> how , sometimes , the unhappy mistake chance for providence .: 157.84
<S> upon my word , said she , it is very droll , and that mad marie michon fared better than she expected .: 56.78
<S> have i not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die ? take courage , said grimaud ; they are gone to find assistance . who are you ? asked the wounded man , fixing his half opened eyes on grimaud .: 54.36
<S> i say , monsieur , that chance has rendered me master of a secret which you will guard , i hope , young man , as your life . but which i must impart to you , monsieur , for you alone can assist me in the mission i have just received from her majesty . is this secret your own ? no , monsieur ; it is her majesty s. are you authorized by her majesty to communicate it to me ? no , monsieur , for , on the contrary , i am desired to preserve the profoundest mystery . why , then , are you about to betray it to me ? because , as i said , without you i can do nothing ; and i am afraid you will refuse me the favor i come to ask if you do not know to what end i ask it . keep your secret , young man , and tell me what you wish . i wish you to obtain for me , from monsieur dessessart , leave of absence for fifteen days . when ? this very night . you leave paris ? i am going on a mission . may you tell me whither ? to london . has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there ? the cardinal , i believe , would give the world to prevent my success . and you are going alone ? i am going alone . in that case you will not get beyond bondy .: 56.65
<S> out of the hundred and sixty three members designated there were only seventy three present , for the rest , fearful of taking part in such an act , had remained away .: 188.58
<S> if i am free , why these bars and these doors ?: 119.66
<S> bassompierre and schomberg from deserting the army , a separate command had to be given to each .: 199.11
<S> this operation proved as great a success as the first .: 121.78
<S> the next morning going on deck , as he always did at an early hour , the patron found dante s leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks , which the rising sun tinged with rosy light .: 195.37
<S> bonacieux to leave the convent , and to retire either into lorraine or belgium .: 178.18
<S> such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously , and sought out more agreeable companions .: 234.96
<S> monte cristo summoned the greek attendant , and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit .: 72.21
<S> i believe , on my soul , that they never mean to finish it . oh , yes , they will ; only listen to that charming <UNK> .: 62.70
<S> wait for me , cried he , i will soon be back , and he set off at a gallop .: 20.68
<S> the whole population was on foot ; drums were beating in the streets and in the port ; the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea .: 209.40
<S> well , you have this excuse : <UNK> , the opening campaign , the opportunity which i offer you so much for the world .: 137.32
<S> and you are disposed to serve the cause of the people ? asked gondy .: 26.40
<S> grimaud obeyed .: 31.00
<S> and when did you arrive here ? inquired she .: 35.42
<S> danglars lost five hundred thousand francs ; but he rid himself of all his spanish shares .: 94.63
<S> i neither know nor care .: 129.72
<S> touch nothing , my little friend , cried the count eagerly ; some of those <UNK> are not only dangerous to taste , but even to inhale . madame de villefort became very pale , and , seizing her son s arm , drew him anxiously toward her ; but , once satisfied of his safety , she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket , which was not lost upon the count .: 71.38
<S> i am as sure now that the king will be saved as i am sure that i clasp the most loyal hand in the world . aramis parted from athos , went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel , whistling the air of a song in praise of cromwell .: 59.21
<S> look at aramis , now ; aramis is mildness and grace personified .: 273.96
<S> a terrible vision the cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript , his cheek upon his hand , and looked intently at the young man for a moment .: 34.07
<S> it was a masonic sign caderousse had taught him .: 110.18
<S> sometimes their play <UNK> into battles , and in these battles the king was not always the stronger .: 276.86
<S> that poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres ? it appears so , said athos , since here they are .: 59.41
<S> d artagnan remained fixed to the spot , astounded and not knowing what to think .: 58.90

<S> d artagnan awakened planchet and ordered him to open it .: 29.48
<S> athos then shrugged his shoulders , and , without putting himself in a passion , <UNK> grimaud .: 73.87
<S> she could read to the depths of the heart of this young man ; the death of buckingham was written there at full length .: 49.57
<S> my vocation commands me ; it carries me away . d artagnan smiled , but made no answer .: 66.29
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> it was the first billet he had received ; it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him .: 36.34
<S> you go , leaving me in all the horror of my situation , after increasing it by what you have revealed to me .: 81.60
<S> one of them recognized him .: 26.01
<S> they were just abreast of <UNK> , and beyond the flat but verdant island of la pianosa .: 353.73
<S> two persons passed near me allow me to conceal their names for the present ; they were speaking in an undertone , and yet i was so interested in what they said that i did not lose a single word . this is a gloomy introduction , if i may judge from your pallor and shuddering , morrel . oh , yes , very gloomy , my friend .: 61.48
<S> the child was small for his age , and <UNK> pale .: 102.42
<S> it was now cromwell s turn to look fixedly at mordaunt , and mordaunt to make himself impenetrable .: 105.23
<S> it was just in time , for valentine s head swam , and she staggered ; madame de villefort instantly hastened to her assistance , and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage , saying : what a singular event !: 70.59
<S> it will then be said of me that i died for the king ; so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit . porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him , tossing his head and repeating , i shall follow up on my idea . aramis , anxious and negligently dressed , said nothing .: 89.03
<S> franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying . alas , said morrel with a feeling of selfish joy ; for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed <UNK> .: 147.53
<S> the mandai a 6 never fails , never trembles , never strikes thirty times <UNK> , like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais , and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer .: 863.73
<S> the two young persons obeyed .: 23.08
<S> at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the <UNK> gascon ; and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers , he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables ; that is to say , athos , porthos , and aramis .: 40.78
<S> at this moment a monstrous <UNK> was heard .: 48.57
<S> there were two means of gaining his object to search him on the spot , or to carry him away , making a buckler of his body , and search him in the trench .: 69.79
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> on the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell .: 20.52
<S> yes , indeed , said he , i believe so . so that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder <UNK> into a <UNK> ? certainly . and the giant took up these two articles , and without any apparent effort produced in them the <UNK> suggested by his companion .: 157.10
<S> well , what are you doing , count to a former lackey ?: 38.89
<S> this fish , which seems so exquisite to you , is very likely no better than perch or <UNK> ; but it seemed impossible to procure it , and here it is . but how could you have these fish brought to france ? oh , nothing more easy .: 86.24
<S> these words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette .: 64.50
<S> project gutenberg is a registered trademark , and may not be used if you charge for an ebook , except by following the terms of the trademark license , including paying royalties for use of the project gutenberg trademark .: 18.23
<S> but he knows it all now , interrupted caderousse ; they say the dead know everything . there was a brief silence ; the abbe rose and paced up and down pensively , and then resumed his seat .: 52.32
<S> dante s listened , and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer .: 81.61
<S> never ! exclaimed athos , raising his right hand to heaven , never !: 24.26

<S> if bonacieux knew where his wife was , one might , by extreme means , force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape .: 131.67
<S> lord de winter continued : the officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen , and therefore know him .: 66.36
<S> she was dressed to go out , her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair , and her gloves were on her hands .: 44.55
<S> therefore , tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his position , provided he were not <UNK> at the unreasonable sum of 5,050,000 francs , he stretched himself on his bed , and after turning over two or three times , fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life luigi vampa was studying .: 140.94
<S> the world calls me beautiful .: 115.26
<S> villefort placed the arm of madame de saint me ran within his own , and conducted her to his apartment .: 19.48
<S> he may have fallen from his horse , he may have cut a <UNK> from the deck ; he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent <UNK> .: 101.28
<S> at last , when pistache was sufficiently well trained , monsieur de beaufort invited the governor and officers of vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment .: 80.05
<S> we have no <UNK> paper , but , see , here they come with the syrup of violets . the doctor was right ; steps were heard in the passage .: 101.05
<S> if anyone seeks a quarrel with you , shun it , were it with a child of ten years old .: 82.18
<S> listen !: 37.45
<S> i am acquainted with it ; before we left villeroy i settled the accounts of the regiment . a false letter altogether , said porthos , we have not been <UNK> . d artagnan , said aramis , in a reproachful tone , how could you believe that we had made a disturbance ? d artagnan grew pale , and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs .: 63.31
<S> the headsman out of the way , the sentence could not be executed .: 84.25
<S> illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed , but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite . well , sir , by the help of two signs , with which i will acquaint you presently , you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties .: 139.34
<S> take some more of these cigars , m. de morcerf . with all my heart , returned albert ; italian cigars are horrible .: 99.62
<S> at this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door , continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the prisoner .: 48.99
<S> but he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a second , than , for fear he should make a third , he is struck down .: 118.57
<S> i am from gascony , it is true ; and since you know it , there is no occasion to tell you that gascons are not very patient , so that when they have begged to be excused once , were it even for a folly , they are convinced that they have done already at least as much again as they ought to have done . monsieur , what i say to you about the matter , said aramis , is not for the sake of seeking a quarrel .: 49.04
<S> so that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged , and as perfectly shut out from observation , as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the faubourg st. germain .: 121.92

<S> these gentlemen are with me , said winter .: 25.78

<S> you are the queen ! queen , forsooth !: 83.16

<S> maximilian , who was paying them a visit , listened to their conversation , or rather was present at it , plunged in his accustomed state of apathy .: 89.80

<S> alas !: 11.34

<S> in a blue frock coat , buttoned up close , decorated with the legion of honor . it is he ! said villefort , turning pale .: 48.56
<S> well , said milady , i have not seen our gascon this evening . what , milady !: 27.67
<S> sir , said she , it is superfluous for me to tell you that valentine s marriage is broken off , since it was here that the affair was concluded . noirtier s countenance remained immovable .: 33.43
<S> as he was about to leave the presence , the cardinal gave him a friendly smile , and said , a perfect harmony reigns , sire , between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers , which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all . he will play me some dog s trick or other , and that immediately , said tre ville .: 88.47
<S> andrea s hand left his pocket <UNK> , and was carried up to the red moustache , which it played with for some time .: 94.82

<S> the king rose immediately , took his book , closed it and went to lay it down on the table , near which he continued standing , in order that mazarin might be obliged to stand also .: 64.26
<S> arrest musketeers !: 478.37
<S> this uneasiness , amounting almost to frenzy , arose from the report morcerf s adventure had made in the world , for the affair at the opera was generally known .: 131.63
<S> and who is the assassin ; they asked together .: 81.83
<S> madame , said he , the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action .: 108.76
<S> let us act in freedom , that we may act well and quickly . i shall go , he said , to the queen . well , then , answered aramis , pray tell me a day or two beforehand , that i may take that opportunity of going to paris . to whom ? zounds !: 47.12
<S> i know you are as brave and <UNK> as any man in the world , but you do not belong to me alone ; you belong to all our party .: 42.18
<S> he will let you into the rooms in his tower , said the curate .: 47.17
<S> ali , bring me some water . the count turned up his sleeves , and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting .: 109.66
<S> in fact , the evening before , a fever had seized him in the midst of the parliament , while he was holding his bed of justice .: 37.33
<S> the falsehood would then lie at my door , and as i am not a gentleman , i may be allowed to lie . be of good heart , planchet , you shall preserve your reputation as a <UNK> man .: 102.97
<S> well , said franz with a sigh , do as you please my dear viscount , for your arguments are beyond my powers of <UNK> .: 77.60
<S> good !: 24.94
<S> give orders to the coachman ; and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it . the steward bowed , and was about to quit the room .: 38.29
<S> yes , my lord . and how much will that cost me , monsieur d artagnan ? zounds , my lord , i don t know yet .: 19.48
<S> it is true that my patrimony will go to <UNK> charitable institutions , and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so , but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i have acted like a man of sense and feeling .: 72.74
<S> that means balls , dinners , and lawn parties without end , in all of which i trust the count will remember us , as he may depend upon it we shall him , in our own humble <UNK> . in spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address , madame danglars could not <UNK> gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months , and who had selected paris for the scene of his princely <UNK> .: 210.25
<S> neither had any .: 150.84
<S> pardieu ! said d artagnan to himself , to whose mind the niece of the <UNK> reverted , pardieu , it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend s house .: 87.00
<S> the absolution .: 89.05
<S> he received also the office of admiral , which had been held by his father , the duc de vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles , demolished by the parliament of <UNK> .: 112.39
<S> it was an ambuscade ! shouted d artagnan .: 34.93
<S> i quit the world ; then i make a sacrifice .: 69.91
<S> alas , said d avrigny , she is indeed dead , poor child ! <UNK> yes , answered the doctor <UNK> , <UNK> the sheet he had raised .: 101.64
<S> athos stretched out his hand toward her .: 27.08
<S> i am king of all creation .: 103.40
<S> from the salon they passed into the bedchamber ; it was a model of taste and simple elegance .: 64.42
<S> degenerate world ! chapter <UNK> .: 843.86
<S> how , sir ! said planchet , is it you ? eh !: 26.94
<S> porthos effaced himself against the wall , but he could not render himself invisible ; and the man in the cloak said to him , giving him his lantern : light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling . then addressing d artagnan : you know the watchword ? he said .: 74.51
<S> the woman , especially , was hideous ; her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified , her countenance had become livid , and her eyes resembled burning <UNK> .: 211.20
<S> in the evening m. de tre ville attended the king s gaming table .: 37.26
<S> the house of morrel son chapter 30 .: 86.78
<S> oh , oh !: 10.23
<S> la ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus ; grimaud , however , did not even smile .: 79.03
<S> as usual , the oldest women were the most decorated , and the <UNK> the most conspicuous .: 98.34
<S> i am not precisely rich , though i am pretty well off . hold , madame , said porthos , let us say no more upon the subject , i beg of you .: 37.16
<S> i fancy i hear horses feet . impossible ! returned d artagnan .: 74.19
<S> tis well ; order four men to conduct them to my lodging . four men prepared to do so .: 72.39
<S> in the front room the follower was also still asleep , her head leaning back on the chair , in all respects worthy of her mistress .: 140.88
<S> emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the rue meslay upon the three successive , sudden , and most unexpected catastrophes of morcerf , danglars , and villefort .: 172.00
<S> it was mousqueton , who , having no straw to lie upon , had helped himself to that of the horses .: 60.56
<S> there he stopped , breathless and panting .: 78.64
<S> perhaps all blood demands some expiation .: 1062.47
<S> i am cold , i am hungry .: 21.24
<S> both , however , cast an inquisitive glance into the tankard it was full of gunpowder .: 99.31
<S> everything considered , you are very well off here .: 91.05
<S> nay , said she , do not smile ; it ill <UNK> with the expression of your countenance , and i am sure it does not spring from your heart .: 50.53
<S> if i once went up those stairs .: 228.18
<S> d artagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers ; but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote , or rather <UNK> , lines of unequal length , <UNK> the words on his fingers .: 130.04
<S> i know that it is terrible , said d artagnan ; but when i reflect that we have killed english , rochellais , spaniards , nay , even french , who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us , whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows i can , on my honor , find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman . as for me , said porthos , now that you have reminded me of it , athos , i have the scene again before me , as if i now were there .: 85.02
<S> i hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim . oh , no , monsieur d artagnan , said raoul , you are such a brave gentleman and the comte de la fere has so much affection for you ! eh !: 33.11
<S> she did not , therefore , even attempt the least resistance , and went out of the cottage .: 42.02
<S> fortunately , the day after tomorrow we leave paris .: 41.54
<S> during the whole time he was speaking , the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutor s <UNK> ; but terminating as it did with such a phrase , the only one which could be caught at by the <UNK> , anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites , which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies .: 129.71
<S> it is a duel , then ? cried mordaunt , as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation .: 44.55
<S> then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper ; he raised his head , and appearing to be perfectly sure of <UNK> : ah , ha , he said , here you are , peppino ! yes , was the laconic reply .: 62.92
<S> all at once he uttered a terrible cry .: 16.46
<S> am i to say what you told me ? asked valentine .: 17.66
<S> at the end of a moment s conversation , in which porthos hinted that a lady of elevated rank had <UNK> to relieve him from his embarrassment , mousqueton entered .: 115.09
<S> then i believe you .: 39.18
<S> do you know , said porthos , that to <UNK> that damned milady s neck would be a smaller sin than to <UNK> those of these poor devils of huguenots , who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin ? what says the abbe ? asked athos , quietly .: 184.45
<S> at last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo ; he eagerly advanced , and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses , saw that there , in all probability , the opening must be .: 86.70
<S> athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear , and advanced alone .: 26.98
<S> bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband , she took him on his weak side .: 78.98
<S> here is a letter i have just received on the subject ; shall it be read , or shall it be passed over ?: 54.00
<S> it seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible thought .: 46.41
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> here we are without occupation , it seems to me . you forget , my friend , that we have work cut out for us in the direction of charenton ; i hope to see monsieur de chatillon , whom i ve hated for a long time , there . why have you hated him ? because he is the brother of coligny . ah , true !: 46.13
<S> please your honors , said the host , a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of you . to which of us ? asked all the four friends .: 50.58
<S> oh , oh ! said d artagnan , comprehending the slight frown of the musketeer .: 24.25
<S> with one word you have crushed it , and i die . but the duel will not take place , edmond , since you forgive ? it will take place , said monte cristo , in a most solemn tone ; but instead of your son s blood to stain the ground , mine will flow . merce de s shrieked , and sprang towards monte cristo , but , suddenly stopping , edmond , said she , there is a god above us , since you live and since i have seen you again ; i trust to him from my heart .: 53.31
<S> praise god , monsieur , replied they , bowing together .: 80.99
<S> arrived at the foot of the bastion , there were still more than a dozen of the enemy .: 27.50
<S> now the scent bag of white satin , on which her cipher is embroidered in pearls . patrick again obeyed .: 182.81
<S> dante s hastened to his dungeon , where he found him standing in the middle of the room , pale as death , his forehead streaming with perspiration , and his hands clenched tightly together .: 40.87
<S> raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground ; but the horse and its rider , of whom he did not lose sight , were evidently sinking .: 145.12
<S> the idea of resisting her father , her grandmother , and all the family , had never occurred to her .: 38.85
<S> now , to apply it in your case , to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable ? to no one , by heaven !: 101.59
<S> maximilian uttered a cry of delight , and , springing forwards , seized the hand extended towards him , and imprinted on it a fervent and <UNK> kiss .: 81.71
<S> made a peer at the restoration , i served through the first campaign under the orders of marshal <UNK> .: 266.76
<S> i guessed all ; i followed him this evening to the opera , and , concealed in a <UNK> box , have seen all . if you have seen all , madame , you know that the son of fernand has publicly insulted me , said monte cristo with awful calmness .: 61.15
<S> sir , said valentine , my grandfather wishes for a notary . at this strange and unexpected demand m. de villefort and his father exchanged looks .: 50.71
<S> day came , the jailer entered .: 55.15
<S> it was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her cloak .: 70.44
<S> it was necessary to compel him to open it , as the sergeant had been compelled to speak , and this took another ten minutes .: 41.89
<S> i was <UNK> to death ; and still further , upon my honor , i don t like english horses .: 73.05
<S> they breakfasted in haste , and at six o clock had already gone ten miles .: 38.33
<S> and what does he say ? asked porthos , in a self sufficient tone .: 16.38
<S> well , where is he , sir ? asked raoul , in a soft and coaxing voice .: 24.26
<S> devoted men are so rare , tre ville , by the back staircase .: 80.79
<S> yes , and important .: 53.61
<S> and having done so , entirely on my own account , be it understood , i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with yanina .: 114.36
<S> i used to play almost every night in france . and since your return to england ? i have not handled a card or dice box . i sincerely pity you , said d artagnan , with an air of profound compassion .: 81.86
<S> now , i think no more ; i say only that fortune has turned against me i had thought to gain heaven , and now i have lost it .: 44.81
<S> how , badly ?: 84.47
<S> i do not wish to be left alone . mother , said the young man , you know how gladly i would obey your wish , but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole evening . well , replied merce de s , sighing , go , albert ; i will not make you a slave to your filial piety . albert pretended he did not hear , bowed to his mother , and quitted her .: 42.06
<S> oh ! cried porthos , as if in pain .: 31.99
<S> thus illumined , aramis read the following epistle : my dear d herblay , i learned from d artagnan who has embraced me on the part of the comte de la fere and yourself , that you are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months ; as i know that you do not like to ask money of your friends i offer you some of my own accord .: 58.31
<S> the quadrille had been most perfect , and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition , carmela alone objecting to it , but the count of san felice besought his daughter so earnestly , that she acceded .: 123.62
<S> this andrea was a wretch , a robber , an assassin , and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education , if not a complete one ; he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune , supported by an honorable name .: 60.29
<S> the four men stood motionless .: 31.07
<S> ah , i confess , your excellency , when i saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle , i felt my eyes filled with tears .: 75.76
<S> then she began thoughtfully to caress the little <UNK> .: 342.85
<S> very true , replied the gascon , but i always run away from compliments .: 40.85
<S> enter , gentlemen , enter , said the queen .: 20.31
<S> the cardinal , therefore , got up , perfumed himself , dressed , and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him .: 47.49
<S> five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer , when the door opened , and a new personage entered .: 53.54
<S> dream of vengeance that evening milady gave orders that when m. d artagnan came as usual , he should be immediately admitted ; but he did not come .: 74.55
<S> besides , you forget that i have a ring likewise . to which you attach more value , it seems , than i do to mine ; at least , i have thought so . yes , for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment , but even a great danger .: 97.98
<S> if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him . and you would do well , if you are afraid of his recovering ; for you know , if a wound in the head does not kill at once , it is cured in a week . and d artagnan threw a second glance toward parry , on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that charles stretched out his hand to him , smiling .: 58.18
<S> my god !: 11.06
<S> i don t ask porthos ; his opinion has been given . why , i think , said aramis , blushing as usual , that his ring not coming from a mistress , and consequently not being a love token , d artagnan may sell it . my dear aramis , you speak like theology personified .: 76.43
<S> come , grimaud , order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can talk . no , sir , no , said grimaud .: 64.24
<S> i have this , said he .: 11.94
<S> luigi pushed the stone behind her , for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward palestrina , he saw a traveller on horseback , stopping a moment , as if uncertain of his road , and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes .: 193.08
<S> beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph .: 82.27
<S> they soon arrived at the silent , solitary inn .: 153.68
<S> here am i , milady , here am i ! cried kitty , springing forward to meet her mistress .: 42.29
<S> well , said the patron , let what may happen , it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you .: 48.73
<S> m. noirtier was sitting in an armchair , which moved upon <UNK> , in which he was <UNK> into the room in the morning , and in the same way drawn out again at night .: 62.11
<S> morrel , said cha teau renaud , will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m. de morcerf is arrived , and we are at his disposal ? morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission .: 28.95
<S> in two days , and by using up two or three horses that s nothing ; i have plenty of money , i am at be thune .: 42.39
<S> i don t know them , but the four other noblemen called the englishman my lord . was the woman handsome ? young and beautiful .: 122.77
<S> one day the old man fell ill and died .: 62.28
<S> it was the fault of their horses , not theirs . another pause .: 105.97
<S> i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers . i regard them as invaluable . now , said monte cristo as to the mother of the young man as to the mother of the young man repeated the italian , with anxiety .: 42.84
<S> they have selected a field of battle on which i am an <UNK> general than they that of a conference .: 142.21
<S> it is the password .: 36.92
<S> notwithstanding his youth , master andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy .: 126.67
<S> i shall fight heart and soul for mazarin ; but but ? but he must make me a baron . zounds ! said d artagnan , that s settled already ; i will be responsible for the barony . on this promise being given , porthos , who had never doubted his friend s assurance , turned back with him toward the castle .: 72.87
<S> come in here , said d avrigny , and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay .: 27.00
<S> gentlemen , continued the baroness , among the ten horses in the stables of baron danglars , are two that belong exclusively to me a pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in paris .: 117.73
<S> all these movements had been effected mechanically , as far as he was concerned .: 81.01
<S> there , on a table , surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan , every species of tobacco known , from the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of <UNK> , and so on along the scale from <UNK> and porto <UNK> , to latakia , was exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the <UNK> are so fond ; beside them , in boxes of fragrant wood , were ranged , according to their size and quality , puros , <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> ; and , in an open cabinet , a collection of german pipes , of chibouques , with their amber mouth pieces ornamented with coral , and of <UNK> , with their long tubes of <UNK> , awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the <UNK> .: 322.45
<S> he is and he is not , replied athos ; that is to say , he is dismissed by one half of france , but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him ; you will perceive that this may last a long time . however , sir , said the stranger , he has neither fled nor is in prison ? no , sir , not at this moment at least . sirs , accept my thanks for your politeness , said the young man , retreating .: 50.75
<S> the ferry across the oise .: 108.04
<S> ah , captain ! said the officer , everything is quiet <UNK> if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house ! and he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the vaudeville now stands .: 113.44
<S> i opened the door of the ante room myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor . because i was shown up the private stairs . how so ? i know not ; it must have been a mistake . mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make d artagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding , so he gave up , for the time , the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing .: 61.21
<S> this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest , as the letter will be found either about his person , at his father s residence , or in his cabin on board the pharaon . the abbe shrugged his shoulders .: 65.54
<S> noirtier made a sign that she was to do so .: 13.97
<S> you have committed the first wrong , since it was you who suspected the queen . what !: 38.27
<S> ah , monsieur ! said the young man , i meet you , then , at last !: 13.66
<S> proceed , was heard on all sides .: 61.12
<S> athos mounted more slowly , after speaking in a low voice to the lackey , who , instead of following them immediately , returned to their rooms .: 50.89
<S> order ; i am ready . for everything ? for everything , cried d artagnan , who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself thus .: 66.84
<S> for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her character perfecting a beautiful vengeance .: 463.33
<S> well ? inquired d artagnan .: 7.90
<S> near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing ; it was elegantly fashioned , and worthy of its mistress .: 104.35
<S> for his death . the death of your prince ? yes . how so ? because he has made his will in my favor . indeed ? on my honor . for how much ? for five hundred thousand . only that ?: 54.60
<S> each one went out by the open doors .: 34.87
<S> after dinner , the count of monte cristo was announced .: 15.89
<S> you are a noble minded woman , and it was your grief that disarmed me .: 59.42
<S> but imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked , the darkness in which our illusions are lost , the precipice whence our happiness has been <UNK> and swallowed up .: 334.14
<S> it is singular , said d artagnan , whilst the boat was taking them to the standard , it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known , but who it was i can not yet remember . a few minutes later they were on board , but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men , and it was eight o clock before they raised anchor .: 64.85
<S> no , no ! exclaimed debray ; that girl is not his wife : he told us himself she was his slave .: 82.58
<S> how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten .: 87.72
<S> yes , yes , to mine ; gad , he was not so proud then , he was an under clerk to the good m. morrel .: 108.22
<S> have you your sword , athos ? cried d artagnan .: 13.35
<S> the guards of the cardinal , perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps , invited him to retire before they attacked . so you may plainly see , tre ville , interrupted the king , it was they who attacked ? that is true , sire ; there can be no more doubt on that head .: 48.91
<S> porthos succeeded him ; and thanks to one of those <UNK> to which he was accustomed , he was able to provide for the wants of all for a fortnight .: 69.68
<S> it followed that d artagnan , who was as yet purely and simply in the guards , found himself , for the time at least , separated from his good friends athos , porthos , and aramis .: 51.00
<S> as to love , the only woman he could have loved was mme .: 68.74
<S> one day he had the imprudence to recall himself to the memory of the cardinal .: 31.18
<S> yes , my lord . and that worthy monsieur du vallon , are we not to enjoy his society ? certainly , my lord ; he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the palais royal . and we start in his carriage , then ? yes , my lord . and with us no other escort but you two ? is it not enough ?: 35.14
<S> tis your fault , you simpleton , answered the duke .: 35.97
<S> ah , it s all one , said the host ; i have lost two customers , but this one remains , of whom i am pretty certain for some days to come .: 52.05
<S> no ; and yet they refused to buy it . why ? said cha teau renaud .: 25.51
<S> it was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood . there s only one remedy , dear raoul that is , to marry her as a compensation . remarked d artagnan .: 110.25
<S> true , said the abbe , with a stifled sigh , merce de s it was . go on , urged caderousse .: 33.87
<S> this arm is paralyzed ; not for a time , but forever .: 99.34
<S> if anyone wishes to stop us , i will show monsieur de tre ville s letter , and you will show your leaves of absence .: 42.06
<S> the baroness rose hastily , and was going into the study , when danglars stopped her .: 36.65
<S> so long as the nets were good , they caught fish ; and so long as they sold their fish , they were able to buy <UNK> for new nets .: 131.67
<S> thank you , count thank you , said the young man , evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation ; yes , everyone in my family is well . so much the better ; yet you have something to tell me ? replied the count with increased anxiety .: 41.93
<S> he fell down this morning and broke his leg .: 53.74
<S> on our arrival in paris , we shall still have four hundred , besides the harnesses , said porthos .: 41.25
<S> then , with a hasty movement , he tore open his coat , which seemed to stifle him , and flew from the room like a madman ; his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor , then the rattling of his carriage wheels as he was driven rapidly away .: 63.06
<S> fatality meantime milady , drunk with passion , roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked , had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast , for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by d artagnan , threatened by athos , and that she had quit france without being revenged on them .: 79.86
<S> d artagnan had already opened the door of the second room , and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object .: 35.24
<S> his companions , horror struck , could neither move nor cry out .: 188.72
<S> the duke vouchsafed no reply , but sitting down at the table made a sign that la ramee should seat himself opposite .: 79.85
<S> absent kings are very soon forgotten ; if he passes over into france his cause is lost . but , persisted the queen , if such be your advice and you have his interest at heart , send him help of men and money , for i can do nothing for him ; i have sold even to my last diamond to aid him .: 142.29
<S> help ! cried a voice , whose mournful accents , reaching the four friends , seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean .: 89.85
<S> thank you , parry . when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall .: 53.29
<S> man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so <UNK> ; happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood , where fierce , fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach ; and monsters of all shapes and kinds , <UNK> to be overcome ere victory is ours .: 756.34
<S> noirtier , burning with impatience and terror , was in despair at his utter <UNK> to help his old domestic , whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant .: 117.06
<S> they arrived at ablain without accident .: 53.28
<S> oh , all this is a family history , as cha teau renaud told you the other day , observed maximilian .: 41.24
<S> tell me . pardieu ! it was the most simple thing in the world .: 24.02
<S> what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end ? valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed , but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather , and she said : at some future time i will tell you all about it . but when will that be ? when i am your wife . the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel , that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose , and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day .: 108.36
<S> first you break your jug , then you make me break your plate ; if all the prisoners followed your example , the government would be ruined .: 136.34
<S> open the door ! cried the host ; open it instantly , sir monk ! no reply .: 68.08
<S> porthos ran to him .: 20.68
<S> in one second athos joined him .: 68.36
<S> hush ! murmured the dying man , that they may not separate us if you save me ! you are right .: 40.94
<S> to the great lady she had given a heart vile and venal ; to the soubrette she had given the heart of a duchess .: 108.48
<S> as for me , answered porthos , i wish my lord cardinal , in order to do honor to my house , which gives him an asylum , would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into a barony , with a promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends , whenever his majesty next <UNK> peers . you know , sir , that before receiving the order one must submit proofs . my friends will submit them .: 128.14
<S> i dare say such a thing might be had . very possibly . and a pair of oxen ? as easily found as the cart . then you see , my good fellow , with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed .: 145.68
<S> i don t remember him . groslow is the man who broke parry s head and is now getting ready to break ours . oh !: 87.66
<S> lord winter was seated near an aperture , arranged as a window to let in the night air , his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon , <UNK> veiled , as we before observed , by heavy clouds .: 220.52
<S> well , sir , i am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to me . and i , madame , replied athos , am looking with admiration . sir , said madame de chevreuse , you must excuse me , but i long to know to whom i am talking .: 23.84
<S> it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting , half bitter , that franz s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous , yet well pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo , and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum .: 133.87
<S> why , it is a veritable <UNK> , my dear friend , that you are making to the temple of friendship , as the poets would say . why , yes , replied d artagnan , with embarrassment .: 48.03
<S> now we discover our error ; a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn .: 240.34
<S> yes , a <UNK> d <UNK> of the great florentine sculptor , <UNK> <UNK> , replied athos .: 724.11
<S> they took their places , and the ballet began .: 25.22
<S> you see , i destroy it ? oh , exclaimed dante s , you are goodness itself . listen , continued villefort ; you can now have confidence in me after what i have done . oh , command , and i will obey . listen ; this is not a command , but advice i give you . speak , and i will follow your advice . i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice .: 47.74
<S> rueil was crowded with advocates , <UNK> and councillors , who came from the parisians , and , on the side of the court , with officers and guards ; it was therefore easy , in the midst of this confusion , to remain as unobserved as any one might wish ; besides , the conferences implied a truce , and to arrest two gentlemen , even frondeurs , at this time , would have been an attack on the rights of the people .: 92.07
<S> do you know him ?: 7.46
<S> tomorrow , if you will , i will hear your narrative ; but today i wish to nurse you carefully .: 79.05
<S> i do not know whether i love you or love you not ; but what i know is that i will not be <UNK> .: 36.83
<S> the burning marseilles sun , which shot into the room through the open door , covered them with a flood of light .: 86.52
<S> the courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls , over which the sun glances <UNK> , when it <UNK> to penetrate into this gulf of moral and physical <UNK> .: 368.89
<S> is this corpse come to life already ?: 270.90
<S> at length they reached the tent , lit a lamp , and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised , d artagnan , with a trembling hand , broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter .: 68.20
<S> the king danced facing the queen , and every time he passed by her , he devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the number .: 84.32
<S> ali pasha was killed , as you know , but before he died he recompensed the services of fernand by leaving him a considerable sum , with which he returned to france , when he was <UNK> lieutenant general . so that now ? inquired the abbe .: 94.05
<S> valentine instinctively raised her eyes , as if to thank heaven .: 82.88
<S> then you know what i have suffered , said mme .: 17.92
<S> was there not some snare laid for her ?: 239.88
<S> she stopped on the threshold , breathed a sigh , and addressing the queen : why , then , do you always weep , mother , when i am away from you ? she said .: 37.11
<S> he gained a village , knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in france .: 154.39
<S> the young girl had freshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with their <UNK> .: 286.79
<S> if you venture again into the house in which i have met you this evening , i will dare it myself . i really think i must have been frightened .: 46.68
<S> if that be the case , said d artagnan , they are doubtless <UNK> her from one prison to another .: 63.35
<S> cap de diou !: 2200.58
<S> aramis <UNK> that bazin should <UNK> at that ceremony and that planchet should furnish the christening sugar <UNK> .: 1058.34
<S> she had fled with him from her convent . with your brother ? yes , my brother was her first lover , and she caused his death .: 50.86
<S> who are you ? who are you ? said the voice .: 11.59
<S> is this that bonacieux ? asked he , after a moment of silence .: 19.05
<S> the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all , for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening , and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them .: 138.38
<S> they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity .: 68.75
<S> porthos was resplendent with joy and pride .: 45.90
<S> the young girl smiled .: 15.12
<S> pooh ! replied d artagnan .: 9.23
<S> that will be the first time i have done so for sixteen days . and me , too ! said d artagnan .: 21.45
<S> brava ! cried morcerf , parodying the banker , as the selection came to an end .: 101.65
<S> ah , those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels ; like me re simon s son , who has not chosen the worst strawberries .: 238.83
<S> my dear count , you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus , said morcerf .: 44.86
<S> when we went up to the enemy it was slowly ; we were forbidden to draw first and we were marching toward the spaniards , who were on a height with lowered muskets .: 152.82
<S> after every action <UNK> exertion , it is conscience that <UNK> us , for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses , of which we alone are judges ; and these reasons , howsoever excellent in producing sleep , would avail us but very little before a tribunal , when we were tried for our lives .: 368.76
<S> milady , not seeing me come again , would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits , and might suspect something ; who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go ? oh , my god ! said kitty , you know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right .: 58.33
<S> as he passed them he said : they are extremely handsome certainly , and you have done well to purchase them , although you were somewhat <UNK> not to have procured them sooner . indeed , your excellency , i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them , and , as it is , they have cost an enormous price . does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful , inquired the count , shrugging his shoulders .: 86.74
<S> vampa in this attire resembled a painting by le opold robert or <UNK> .: 568.41
<S> as for andrea , he began , by way of showing off , to scold his groom , who , instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house , had taken it to the outer door , thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it .: 56.81
<S> if it is a snare , replied d artagnan , i shall scent it out , be assured .: 29.57
<S> vicomte , come here , said athos ; the duchess permits you to kiss her hand . the youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare , and kneeling down , kissed the hand of the duchess de chevreuse .: 51.42
<S> the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality <UNK> by these two men ; one is the equality that <UNK> , the other is the equality that <UNK> ; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine , the other <UNK> the people to a level with the throne .: 248.71
<S> you are mistaken .: 16.06
<S> these things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly . ah , ma foi , under any circumstances ! said caderousse , who drank as he spoke , and on whom the <UNK> of the wine began to take effect , under any circumstances fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of dante s ; is he , danglars ? no , you are right and i should say that would bring him ill luck . well , never mind , answered caderousse , pouring out a glass of wine for fernand , and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time , while danglars had merely sipped his .: 101.96
<S> neither of them spoke to him ; they merely stood aside to let him pass by , as usual , nothing more .: 63.08
<S> now , allowing for contrary winds , accidents , and a woman s weakness , there are twelve days . well , monsieur duke , said the king , have you made your calculations ? yes , sire .: 58.04
<S> at three o clock came two companies of the guards , one french , the other swiss .: 53.71
<S> villefort also rang ; his new valet brought him the papers , and with them a cup of chocolate .: 94.00
<S> will that do ? yes . what are you looking at ? i am looking at you ; indeed you are adorable like that !: 47.89
<S> and now let everyone retire . must i go too ? asked valentine timidly .: 58.65
<S> but as you are the strongest , after all , continued d artagnan , don t be furious with old men and women , and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions . the people listened to these words and let go the ladies , who thanked d artagnan with an eloquent look .: 84.19
<S> faria , as we have said , without having recovered the use of his hand and foot , had regained all the clearness of his understanding , and had gradually , besides the moral instructions we have detailed , taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner , who learns to make something from nothing .: 117.79
<S> the spit turned , the stove roared , the pretty madeleine wept ; d artagnan felt himself invaded by hunger , cold and love .: 205.43
<S> of this he took no heed , but was , as far as appearances might be trusted , enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams .: 277.61
<S> if i remember rightly , it had another entrance , and the courtyard was paved and empty ; while today we have a splendid lawn , bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old . why not ?: 88.92
<S> bonacieux ; in a tone of reproach , ah , monsieur , i had your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman .: 54.60
<S> yes , sir . you have not been long detained . no .: 41.80
<S> the next day they stopped at the ho tel de <UNK> , at brussels .: 31.71
<S> <UNK> as he was , porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold , but had at least half .: 113.79
<S> i am going home .: 19.07
<S> the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .: 46.63
<S> they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town , guarded by two sentinels .: 32.72
<S> well , said aramis , beaten by fate ! beaten ! said athos .: 73.00
<S> only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering . villefort shuddered at the suggestion ; but he had gone too far to draw back .: 87.32
<S> and your third attack if , indeed , you should have another will find you at liberty .: 86.34
<S> you understand ! athos shrugged his shoulders , and followed his guards silently , while m. bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a tiger .: 89.91
<S> oh , what a detestable crew they are , these <UNK> speculators ! madame , replied danglars , the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you ; they were scarcely four years old , and they made me extremely uneasy on your account . nonsense , retorted the baroness ; you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject , because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris .: 77.24
<S> most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility : www.gutenberg.org .: 112.65
<S> begone , and may god guide you ! amen ! cried the young man , and set off at full gallop .: 38.11
<S> he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father s honor ; but when that was done , why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms ?: 59.77
<S> in the meanwhile , as the godfather is a second father , we beg the reader to lay to our account , and not to that of the comte de la fe re , the pleasure or the ennui he may experience .: 83.78
<S> when he saw luigi , he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him .: 27.66
<S> you can restore it to his family , said d artagnan .: 16.45
<S> how , can not be ?: 30.80
<S> cha teau renaud looked for a moment for morrel ; but while they were watching the departure of the count , morrel had quitted his post , and cha teau renaud , failing in his search , joined debray and beauchamp .: 43.12
<S> speak ! the young woman extended her stiff white hands towards him .: 76.15
<S> your pardon , my officer , said athos ; but we were ignorant with whom we had to do , and you may see that we were keeping good guard . your name ? said the officer , who covered a part of his face with his cloak .: 41.53
<S> i am very anxious to see this man .: 11.29
<S> let her do what she likes with the duke ; i care no more about him than an empty bottle . and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass .: 122.37
<S> ha !: 25.83
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> well ? asked madame danglars , with an anxiety easy to be understood .: 36.39
<S> you were going to visit monsieur de la fere ? said d artagnan .: 9.51
<S> good , said monte cristo , smiling ; in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a well <UNK> soldier . and you leave us , said julie , at a moment s warning ?: 78.82
<S> at the moment he was about to go out , lord de winter appeared in the corridor , followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of milady .: 18.34
<S> i present to you , he said , monsieur le chevalier d artagnan , lieutenant of his majesty s musketeers , a devoted friend and one of the most excellent , brave gentlemen that i have ever known . d artagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way , and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at athos .: 50.20
<S> do you see ? cried the lieutenant .: 11.47
<S> the timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the <UNK> of woman .: 131.68
<S> memory makes the one , philosophy the other . but can not one learn philosophy ? philosophy can not be taught ; it is the application of the sciences to truth ; it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven . well , then , said dante s , what shall you teach me first ?: 126.36
<S> they are only four ! a joyous smile lighted porthos s face .: 91.99
<S> compose yourself , madame , said he ; all danger is over . the woman looked up at these words , and , with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been , pointed to her child , who still continued insensible .: 71.85
<S> fire , then ! when the shot was fired .: 68.77
<S> in a quarter of an hour we set off . that s the advice i was about to give monsieur ; and where are we going , may i ask , without being too curious ? pardieu ! in the opposite direction to that which you said i was gone .: 48.10
<S> the queen !: 14.76
<S> are you a man for the <UNK> , and is gold your god ?: 123.65
<S> one hundred thousand francs for a loaf ? one hundred thousand francs , repeated peppino .: 35.72
<S> section 1 .: 33.41
<S> the breakfast at m. de tre ville s was as gay and cheerful as possible .: 26.43
<S> ah , traitor ! muttered d artagnan , leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear , you have made us swear on the crucifix of a frondeuse . chapter xxix .: 63.41
<S> i am not obliged to read any breviary .: 62.76
<S> be it so , said athos ; yet it is probable , on the contrary , that we shall enter , because we seem to have to do with sensible people .: 32.24
<S> or the mysterious <UNK> , said athos .: 113.32
<S> the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin .: 131.13
<S> no , he muttered , the doubt i felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness ; but here the wound <UNK> , and the heart again thirsts for vengeance .: 158.37
<S> the nurse , having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient , and locked the door , was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the kitchen , and <UNK> her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the house of the king s attorney .: 81.73
<S> like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal gift , she brought misfortune upon everything she touched .: 392.40
<S> if anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which madame de villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on valentine .: 71.26
<S> you have done well to warn me .: 36.58
<S> at other times he would return home to write a treatise , and requested his friends not to disturb him .: 86.04
<S> i will go i will go ! d artagnan took the soldier s arquebus , made him go on before him , and urged him toward his companion by <UNK> him behind with his sword .: 67.15
<S> my dear albert , he said , if you will make haste , we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonia s .: 42.64
<S> meantime , d artagnan , who is full of invention , would find some way to save the king .: 39.31
<S> but however and <UNK> he did escape , what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he owed his long imprisonment ; who had taken him , rich , brave , glorious , beloved by women , feared by men , to cut off his life s best , happiest years ; for it is not life , it is merely existence , in prison !: 166.75
<S> a few locks of gray mingled with his hair , which was still thick and matted , while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had <UNK> the heat of the equator and the storms of the <UNK> .: 181.21
<S> would you like to know how matters have <UNK> ?: 112.32
<S> they had reached the ladder which led to the boat .: 25.27
<S> mordaunt made several strokes more , and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves : pity , pity on me , gentlemen , in heaven s name !: 111.51
<S> well , you will follow me to the grave with the rank of captain . what have i , then , done to you , said felton , much agitated , that you should load me with such a responsibility before god and before men ?: 56.57
<S> in a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save france the second time from <UNK> was unrolled in his mind .: 73.75
<S> close the door , said la carconte ; i do not like open doors when it thunders . particularly when there is money in the house , eh ? answered caderousse , double <UNK> the door .: 150.19
<S> he began his day by breakfasting <UNK> a bad beginning when one wants to employ the head , but an excellent precaution when one wants to work the body ; and about two o clock he had his two horses saddled , and followed by planchet he quitted paris by the barriere de la <UNK> .: 191.96
<S> mordaunt was livid , but he uttered no cry nor called for assistance .: 82.53
<S> what then ? well , he is a man . porthos looked at d artagnan in astonishment .: 16.71
<S> limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it , you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from .: 64.56
<S> back , people ! cried d artagnan , your leader is dead ; you have no longer any business here . indeed , as if de rochefort had been the very soul of the attack , the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall .: 67.74
<S> soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel , which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door .: 82.56
<S> you appear to consider this a point of honor , and it may be for this reason , that you have delayed acknowledging your name .: 57.01
<S> why should that man give me a false diamond ? <UNK> to get your secret without paying for it , you blockhead ! caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea .: 121.87
<S> trust me , said aramis , do not expect to find anything in abbeville .: 41.43
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> give him a direct invitation , but do not ask me to present him .: 40.19

<S> d artagnan took out the parcel which he had desired bernouin to place under the seat .: 58.37
<S> fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece , still having his name kept on the army roll .: 429.35
<S> they were in the marvellous dining room before described , where the statues had baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and flowers .: 154.41
<S> but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father , he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of maximilian .: 41.09
<S> he no longer loved her ; he adored her .: 31.85
<S> they passed to the third story ; it was the telegraph room .: 53.86
<S> for what reason is all this <UNK> and fury ? asked athos .: 70.26
<S> it was too late , for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine , placed for him expressly by the pope s <UNK> .: 57.56
<S> in the name of that young lady you love , and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not ! cried the bandit , throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand for he began to lose his strength with his blood .: 57.46
<S> three or four palikares fell with their bodies literally <UNK> with wounds .: 585.47
<S> every criminal i condemn seems to me living evidence that i am not a hideous exception to the rest .: 232.43
<S> i am very sorry for what you tell me , said the governor , replying to the assurance of the doctor , that the old man is really dead ; for he was a quiet , inoffensive prisoner , happy in his folly , and required no watching . ah , added the turnkey , there was no occasion for watching him ; he would have stayed here fifty years , i ll answer for it , without any attempt to escape . still , said the governor , i believe it will be requisite , notwithstanding your certainty , and not that i doubt your science , but in discharge of my official duty , that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead . there was a moment of complete silence , during which dante s , still listening , knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time .: 54.53
<S> mercy ! said caderousse , crossing himself .: 43.58
<S> the latter took in the whole scene at a glance .: 47.66
<S> at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir , madame de villefort was standing erect , pale , her features contracted , and her eyes glaring horribly .: 54.61
<S> are there any others ? yes ; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons . let us visit them , said the inspector with an air of fatigue .: 54.16
<S> the servant returned with a message to say , that , though the duchess had not the honor of knowing monsieur de la fere , she would receive him .: 41.18
<S> well , sir , said andrea , bowing to the banker respectfully , may i hope ? you may not only hope , said danglars , but consider it a settled thing , if no obstacle arises on your part . i am , indeed , rejoiced , said andrea .: 46.27
<S> yet you have unquestionably some ambition . i have , sir . and what may it be ? i too , as happens to every man once in his life , have been taken by satan into the highest mountain in the earth , and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the world , and as he said before , so said he to me , child of earth , what <UNK> thou have to make thee adore me ? i reflected long , for a gnawing ambition had long <UNK> upon me , and then i replied , listen , i have always heard of providence , and yet i have never seen him , or anything that resembles him , or which can make me believe that he exists .: 100.91
<S> now we are alone , dear aramis , said d artagnan , tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of planchet s horse . i faith ! answered aramis , as you see , from heaven . from heaven , replied d artagnan , shaking his head ; you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there . my friend , said aramis , with a look of imbecility on his face which d artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers , if i did not come from heaven , at least i was leaving paradise , which is almost the same . here , then , is a puzzle for the learned , observed d artagnan , until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of paradise ; some place it on mount <UNK> , others between the rivers tigris and euphrates ; it seems that they have been looking very far away for it , while it was actually very near .: 64.21
<S> in an instant we were on the alert , but it was too late ; our vessel was surrounded , and amongst the custom house officers i observed several gendarmes , and , as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other , i sprang into the hold , opened a port , and dropped into the river , dived , and only rose at intervals to breathe , until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rho ne to the canal that runs from beaucaire to <UNK> <UNK> .: 101.76
<S> an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter , and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury .: 201.03
<S> d artagnan departed , scarcely knowing what to think , but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head , while continuing to pay his court to milady , he had framed a little plan in his mind .: 60.01
<S> who ? him ! him ! m .: 114.97
<S> you were told to guard her to fire at her if she attempted to fly .: 89.12
<S> but as we have said he was active , strong , and full of presence of mind .: 48.89
<S> look here !: 50.26
<S> at the moment he passed through the gateway into the street , the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped , although it was in the month of august , and lifted his hat , which the traveler seized with his hand the moment it had left his head , pulling it eagerly over his eyes .: 52.01
<S> but still further , his education had been so little neglected , even with respect to <UNK> studies , so rare at this time among gentlemen , that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis sported and which porthos pretended to understand .: 230.87
<S> edmond started .: 38.24
<S> we can not fight with such names ; they are names of shepherds . therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names , said athos .: 96.33
<S> monsieur groslow is perhaps rather hasty , it s true , but at bottom i have discovered two good qualities in him he is <UNK> and stupid . porthos opened his eyes in amazement ; athos and aramis looked at one another and smiled ; they knew d artagnan , and knew that he did nothing without a purpose .: 87.02
<S> it was thus with milady .: 35.51
<S> why should i leave you ? that is not for me to say ; but we are now about to <UNK> in society to visit and be visited . i don t wish to see anybody but you . and should you see one whom you could prefer , i would not be so unjust i have never seen anyone i preferred to you , and i have never loved anyone but you and my father . my poor child , replied monte cristo , that is merely because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you . i don t want anybody else to talk to me .: 45.41
<S> ere long marseilles presented herself to view , marseilles , white , <UNK> , full of life and energy , marseilles , the younger sister of <UNK> and <UNK> , the successor to them in the empire of the mediterranean , marseilles , old , yet always young .: 280.93
<S> we are rich .: 30.26
<S> they passed through a courtyard as they went , full of soldiers and courtiers .: 65.58
<S> and as we are prevented from going down there , we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house ; so that our hostelry is daily going to ruin .: 120.18

<S> now , said she , listen to me . the request was needless .: 24.38
<S> this , cried the voice , the tone of which was at once polished and jeering , this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men .: 91.72

<S> it will be a work of time , but those who have begun by crying out : down with mazarin !: 72.28

<S> what is he doing up there ? and they called cha teau renaud s attention to him .: 51.76
<S> then , believe me , it will be time to act . yes , we will wait .: 20.39
<S> so from that time , monsieur , continued the latter , we have led the most miserable life imaginable ; for you must know , monsieur , that all our provisions are in the cellar .: 44.20
<S> if you were to die , i should die too . the count , with a smile of profound tenderness , extended his hand , and she carried it to her lips .: 15.90

<S> father and son chapter 3 .: 68.57
<S> well , said she , hardly giving franz time to sit down , it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven , and you are already the best friends in the world . without being so far advanced as that , my dear countess , returned franz , i can not deny that we have abused his good nature all day . all day ? yes ; this morning we breakfasted with him ; we rode in his carriage all day , and now we have taken possession of his box . you know him , then ? yes , and no . how so ? it is a long story . tell it to me . it would frighten you too much . so much the more reason . at least wait until the story has a conclusion . very well ; i prefer complete <UNK> ; but tell me how you made his acquaintance ?: 67.40
<S> four hundred and seventy five livres , said d artagnan , who reckoned like archimedes .: 81.35
<S> what was it then ?: 18.48
<S> what do you mean ? cried d artagnan .: 4.07

<S> i was going about at random , inquiring of everybody , when i saw you gallop past .: 124.68
<S> my young vicomte , replied scarron , i suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive . raoul blushed again .: 117.11

<S> he returned to merce de s with tears in his eyes and heaving breast , and without uttering a word he gave her the letter .: 40.61
<S> then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love , and approached the couch on which he was reposing , their feet hidden in their long white <UNK> , their throats bare , hair flowing like waves , and assuming <UNK> which the gods could not resist , but which saints <UNK> , and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird ; and then he gave way before looks that held him in a <UNK> grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss .: 303.38
<S> monsieur , said albert with affectionate courtesy , the count of cha teau renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me ; you are his friend , be ours also . well said , interrupted cha teau renaud ; and pray that , if you should ever be in a similar predicament , he may do as much for you as he did for me . what has he done ? asked albert .: 54.25
<S> each examined the other with great attention , while exchanging the customary compliments ; both were very handsome , but of quite different <UNK> of beauty .: 273.79
<S> the light of day reassured me ; i went and threw myself on the bed , without parting with the <UNK> knife , which i concealed under my pillow .: 99.33
<S> most likely , replied vampa coolly .: 96.40
<S> what do you mean ? asked valentine .: 5.07
<S> a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor .: 59.06

<S> he then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbits for the abbe adelmonte had a collection of rabbits , cats , and guinea pigs , fully as fine as his collection of vegetables , flowers , and fruit .: 104.81
<S> be assured you will not find her majesty ungrateful . oh , i am already grandly recompensed ! cried d artagnan .: 57.76
<S> the eyes of all shone <UNK> as they made their demand , and the red light of the fire made them look like demons .: 112.83
<S> no , no , she vociferated , no , you can not wish that ! <UNK> what i do not wish , madame , is that you should perish on the scaffold .: 53.42
<S> this silence and this interruption in serving , which were unintelligible to porthos , had , on the contrary , a terrible meaning for the clerks .: 96.10
<S> the cardinal was acquainted with the activity , and more particularly the hatred , of buckingham .: 55.01
<S> and now , said athos , unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud , i think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter . meantime , his eminence continued his melancholy ride , murmuring between his mustaches , these four men must positively be mine . chapter lii .: 142.23
<S> you do not know these men , monsieur comminges , but i know them , first personally , also by <UNK> .: 74.99
<S> positively , these four men must be on my side . the same evening the cardinal spoke to m. de tre ville of the exploit of the morning , which was the talk of the whole camp .: 46.21
<S> the chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a single word of it .: 27.23
<S> the masks could not appear ; the carriages could not move about ; but the masks were visible behind the windows , the carriages , and the doors .: 50.51
<S> he he is murmured grimaud , pale as a ghost and seizing his master s hand .: 62.40
<S> love ! pardon for what ? asked she .: 71.86
<S> try and find a seat there is one by that <UNK> , which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper . beauchamp , said albert , it is of your journal that i come to speak . indeed ?: 85.75
<S> yes , he has a wife , who through everything has behaved like an angel ; he has a daughter , who was about to marry the man she loved , but whose family now will not allow him to <UNK> the daughter of a ruined man ; he has , besides , a son , a lieutenant in the army ; and , as you may suppose , all this , instead of <UNK> , only <UNK> his sorrows .: 64.60
<S> so i have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone .: 38.34
<S> and now there is no more to be said ; go and rejoin your mother and sister . my father , said the young man , bending his knee , bless me ! morrel took the head of his son between his two hands , drew him forward , and kissing his forehead several times said : oh , yes , yes , i bless you in my own name , and in the name of three generations of irreproachable men , who say through me , the edifice which misfortune has destroyed , providence may build up again . on seeing me die such a death , the most inexorable will have pity on you .: 65.57
<S> could you have imagined this scene , cha teau renaud , when we saw her , at the most three weeks ago , about to sign that contract ? indeed , no , said cha teau renaud . did you know her ? i spoke to her once or twice at madame de morcerf s , among the rest ; she appeared to me charming , though rather melancholy .: 62.54
<S> thus the day passed away .: 38.38
<S> d artagnan , said athos , taking his hand , you know i love you ; if i had a son i could not love him better .: 20.61
<S> he watched them pass through the crowd for some time , but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello .: 31.72
<S> a torrent , whose bed was dry , led into a deep <UNK> .: 255.96
<S> then it is for to day ? asked the king .: 27.46
<S> men fell around him as they had fallen at rocroy or at <UNK> .: 246.89
<S> that concerns your majesty more than me , said the cardinal .: 32.99
<S> after a second , a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel , which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air , and then franz heard a slight report .: 64.16
<S> for my part , said d artagnan , i say this must come to an end ; murderer , as you were , of your uncle !: 43.54
<S> all this time the soldiers were calling out , stop !: 70.56
<S> tre ville was one of these latter .: 37.24
<S> on the 20th of august it was known at marseilles that he had left town in the <UNK> , and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month , and that morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk emmanuel , and his cashier cocles , to meet the creditors .: 85.25
<S> let me conduct your business and my own .: 44.51
<S> no .: 17.05
<S> they spread their cloaks .: 115.04
<S> you have guessed it , answered aramis ; and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything ; he thought they were fighting .: 66.47
<S> are you not a sportsman and a great wolf hunter ?: 182.82
<S> the law would seize it , and put you in prison ; if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty , the ring will be lost , or a false stone , worth three francs , will be given you , instead of a diamond worth 50,000 or perhaps 55,000 francs ; from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in purchasing . caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other .: 79.67
<S> those fellows strike hard , and don t leave off in a hurry .: 135.28
<S> the two children grew up together , passing all their time with each other , and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different characters .: 62.30
<S> at these words he gave me a ring .: 22.28
<S> good , said monte cristo to morrel , who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which danglars had been the victim , i have just made a discovery for twenty five thousand francs , for which i would have paid a hundred thousand . what have you discovered ? asked morrel .: 44.02
<S> willingly , replied de chatillon .: 43.82
<S> albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume .: 165.76
<S> one fine morning the king commanded m. de chevalier dessessart to admit d artagnan as a cadet in his company of guards .: 102.71
<S> the moment for my escape is fixed seven o clock .: 70.17
<S> my lord , either with the officers of the guard , with the other prisoners , or with me . but does he not approach the walls while playing ? your eminence doesn t know those walls ; they are sixty feet high and i doubt if monsieur de beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping off . hum ! said the cardinal , beginning to feel more comfortable .: 123.78
<S> aramis had killed one of his adversaries , but the other pressed him warmly .: 63.04
<S> because , said debray , albert sent this morning to request us to come . beauchamp and cha teau renaud exchanged looks of astonishment .: 80.48

<S> yes , my dear father , and with your permission , now i have seen you , and know you are well and have all you require , i will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the catalans . go , my dear boy , said old dante s ; and heaven bless you in your wife , as it has blessed me in my son ! his wife ! said caderousse ; why , how fast you go on , father dante s ; she is not his wife yet , as it seems to me . no , but according to all probability she soon will be , replied edmond .: 48.17
<S> on the king s service . the musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus received .: 81.12

<S> i beg you to understand , sir , i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me . this threat brought no reply .: 43.15

<S> m .: 15.88
<S> not the least in the world . oh , you do quite right , monsieur . but why this question ? because , while you were talking with him , i watched you without listening to you ; and , monsieur , his countenance changed color two or three times ! bah ! preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received , he did not observe that ; but i , whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guard i did not lose a movement of his features . and you found it ? <UNK> , monsieur . indeed ! still more ; as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street , monsieur bonacieux took his hat , shut his door , and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction . it seems you are right , planchet ; all this appears to be a little mysterious ; and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be <UNK> explained to us . monsieur jests , but monsieur will see . what would you have , planchet ?: 73.38
<S> this lady is infamous . my lord , milady de winter is an angel ; you know that she is , and i demand her liberty of you . bah !: 49.90

<S> are you not aware that this italian <UNK> everything , both indoors and out ?: 354.99
<S> then , certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders , she started her horse and disappeared .: 54.87
<S> cloud , and who had reasons for not being seen , and yet d artagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was mme .: 50.07
<S> ah ! said mousqueton , who had ridden by the side of d artagnan without speaking a word on the journey , you may think what you will , sir , but i can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds ; and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of monsieur du vallon and his friends .: 41.97
<S> for my part , i always thought his poetry detestable , and i think i know something about poetry . who is this officer , inquired raoul of athos , who is speaking ? monsieur de scudery , the author of <UNK> , and of le grand <UNK> , which were composed partly by him and partly by his sister , who is now talking to that pretty person yonder , near monsieur scarron . raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived .: 164.40
<S> he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences , alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to <UNK> from his childhood .: 290.83
<S> he is now in his fifth year of captivity ; he will ask to speak to you in private , and offer you five millions . how curious ! what is his name ? the abbe faria . no .: 55.96
<S> what ails our friend ? said aramis , he resembles one of dante s damned , whose neck <UNK> has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels .: 253.62
<S> the two oarsmen bent to their work , and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai d orle ans .: 124.77
<S> let us talk of your happy return , my boy .: 29.61
<S> the idea was welcomed by the prince , to whom it was of little importance whom he married , so long as he married some one .: 80.76
<S> my poor friend , i had forgotten you were in love . well , but , said aramis , have you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent ?: 41.08
<S> he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power , and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy .: 69.57
<S> in france the first fear of the king of england , charles i. , on learning of the death of the duke , was that such terrible news might <UNK> the rochellais ; he tried , says richelieu in his memoirs , to conceal it from them as long as possible , closing all the ports of his kingdom , and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which buckingham was getting together had gone , taking upon himself , in default of buckingham , to superintend the departure .: 128.15
<S> adieu . au revoir .: 55.65
<S> d artagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face .: 26.17
<S> he ordered two horses to be saddled , and himself went as guide to the young guardsman .: 66.93
<S> he persisted until , at last , he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole .: 63.89
<S> sell ! cried mousqueton , about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character left .: 262.44
<S> anne followed him with her eyes , and as he withdrew , at every step he took , a disdainful smile was seen playing , then gradually burst upon her lips .: 60.61
<S> bonacieux would have fled in terror ; but she was absorbed by jealousy .: 71.75
<S> high heads expose themselves from afar , and the cardinal is <UNK> . well , said porthos , in the first place make a bargain with the mercer , and a good bargain . that s useless , said d artagnan ; for i believe if he does not pay us , we shall be well enough paid by another party . at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs ; the door was thrown violently open , and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held .: 58.43
<S> why , the man must owe me a fearful grudge . does his action appear like that of an enemy ? no ; certainly not . well , then and so he is in paris ? yes . and what effect does he produce ? why , said albert , he was talked about for a week ; then the <UNK> of the queen of england took place , followed by the theft of mademoiselle mars s diamonds ; and so people talked of something else . my good fellow , said cha teau renaud , the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly .: 81.97
<S> henceforth , valentine , you will never again be separated on earth , since he has rushed into death to find you .: 69.34
<S> the pope , therefore blesses with the fingers .: 135.58
<S> twenty times he <UNK> for edmond .: 293.88
<S> franz gave him albert s letter .: 39.38
<S> bonacieux had made with him for that very evening ; but we are bound to say , to the credit of our hero , that the bad opinion entertained by m. de tre ville of women in general , did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess .: 81.63
<S> the duke exchanged a signal with them .: 70.67
<S> a rich uniform , half french , half oriental , set off his graceful and stalwart figure , and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the legion of honor .: 103.75
<S> they proposed a game of bouillotte .: 185.07
<S> his boots were covered with dust , and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to england .: 70.73
<S> you are the king s servant , and must go wherever that service calls you . oh , villefort ! cried rene e , clasping her hands , and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness , be merciful on this the day of our betrothal . the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair <UNK> sat , and leaning over her chair said tenderly : to give you pleasure , my sweet rene e , i promise to show all the <UNK> in my power ; but if the charges brought against this bonapartist hero prove correct , why , then , you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off . rene e shuddered at the word cut , for the growth in question had a head .: 114.93
<S> is the deed of sale ready ? yes , count . have you brought it ? here it is . very well ; and where is this house that i purchase ? asked the count carelessly , addressing himself half to bertuccio , half to the notary .: 52.49
<S> however , i swear i was not guilty , i swear it by the queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear , and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry , a small coffer of rosewood set in silver , and laying it on the altar : i swear , she said , by these sacred relics that buckingham was not my lover . what relics are those by which you swear ? asked mazarin , smiling .: 90.05
<S> we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders . as to my health , since it has stood five years of prison , with monsieur de chavigny to boot , tis excellent !: 96.88
<S> take notice , captain , he continued , giving planchet his expected title , take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from here told me privately to distrust these gentlemen . and i , said planchet , with dignity , i know them and i answer for them . as he said this , he pressed grimaud s hand , who seemed honored by the distinction .: 101.50
<S> the noiseless door again turned on its hinges , and the count of monte cristo reappeared .: 39.30
<S> the safety of the horseman , you know , depends almost always upon the goodness of his horse . well , transfer it to me at the price it cost you ? i was going to make you the offer , my dear d artagnan , giving you all the time necessary for <UNK> me such a trifle . how much did it cost you ? eight hundred livres . here are forty double pistoles , my dear friend , said d artagnan , taking the sum from his pocket ; i know that is the coin in which you were paid for your <UNK> . you are rich , then ? said aramis .: 55.61
<S> nobody knows you .: 59.22
<S> ah , my dear friend ! he cried , what bad <UNK> for my horses here . indeed ! said d artagnan ; i am most unhappy to hear it , on account of those fine animals . and i , also i was also wretchedly off , he answered , moving backward and forward as he spoke ; and had it not been for the hostess , he added , with his air of vulgar self complacency , who is very agreeable and understands a joke , i should have got a lodging elsewhere . the pretty madeleine , who had approached during this <UNK> , stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing porthos s words , for she thought the scene with the swiss was about to be repeated .: 89.41
<S> then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton , that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another , he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared .: 147.74
<S> at eight o clock in the morning morrel entered their chamber .: 15.27
<S> after which , the cardinal , who had been informed that d artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him , took leave of the king , inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke .: 50.05
<S> at length villefort , the most composed of all , spoke : sir , said he to maximilian , you say you loved valentine , that you were betrothed to her .: 58.21
<S> but first of all i must get there . he went back to the room where he had left monte cristo .: 30.54
<S> here s to our colonel , and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as london and farther . and as d artagnan , as he spoke , looked at harrison , the colonel imagined the toast was for himself .: 91.62
<S> his vengeance , therefore , consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin ; he even tried to make some verses on him , but soon gave up the attempt , for monsieur de beaufort had not only not received from heaven the gift of <UNK> , he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose .: 117.72
<S> porthos drew back a step .: 31.40
<S> nineteen , returned dante s .: 37.92
<S> the young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness , while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity .: 26.10
<S> thus , from <UNK> to <UNK> , everyone trembles at the name of cucumetto .: 234.72
<S> this malady admits but of one remedy ; i will tell you what that is .: 159.63
<S> i do assure you , grandpapa ah m .: 138.78
<S> he was alone .: 13.80
<S> woe to them if it be so ! and he turned around , so stern with anger , strength and threat , that the most excited rebels <UNK> back on one another , in order to escape , and some of them even rolled into the seine .: 105.18
<S> as to aramis , he never played .: 23.16
<S> where do you suffer ? asked the doctor .: 13.61
<S> in the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar , which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited them .: 112.26
<S> in the first place , said athos , let us leave this chamber ; the dead are not agreeable company , particularly when they have died a violent death . planchet , said d artagnan , i commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care .: 49.13
<S> paternal affection .: 167.82
<S> as to the gentleman , he resumed his place at the window , and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience , evidently annoyed by their remaining <UNK> .: 62.69
<S> as mademoiselle de scudery remarks . scarron and raoul laughed .: 489.60
<S> d artagnan , i am ready to follow you . and i also , said porthos .: 12.37
<S> if i were a frondeur , said d artagnan , i should knock here and should be sure of a good supper .: 36.48
<S> monsieur du vallon and i are the only two who are armed .: 43.85
<S> it was danglars letter to the king s attorney , which the count of monte cristo , disguised as a clerk from the house of thomson french , had taken from the file against edmond dante s , on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to m. de boville .: 27.57
<S> in the most simple and natural manner possible .: 42.22
<S> having passed through the rue du mont blanc , guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path , he found himself at the end of the rue la <UNK> .: 93.14
<S> i want to learn . everything , said the abbe .: 23.47
<S> the women had already fled , taking refuge in vitry ; only a few men remained .: 174.21
<S> arrived at <UNK> , d artagnan assembled his friends .: 148.07
<S> could you ever have credited such a thing , my dear danglars ? asked m. morrel , as , on his return to the port for the purpose of <UNK> fresh tidings of dante s , from m. de villefort , the assistant procureur , he overtook his supercargo and caderousse .: 72.95
<S> there is a certain fatality in it . yes , you are right , d artagnan , a fatality that will separate and ruin us !: 57.88
<S> milady made one step forward , and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent .: 24.79
<S> bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening .: 116.46
<S> what do you say , athos , to that proposition ?: 26.02
<S> she was forced to return to tours ; she is not faithless ; she still loves me !: 57.41
<S> yes , count , returned julie , we may indeed say he has , for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen ; he sent us one of his angels . the count s cheeks became scarlet , and he coughed , in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth .: 60.73
<S> in exchange , he continued , give me the red silk purse that m. morrel left on old dante s chimney piece , and which you tell me is still in your hands . caderousse , more and more astonished , went toward a large oaken cupboard , opened it , and gave the abbe a long purse of faded red silk , round which were two copper <UNK> that had once been gilt .: 119.31
<S> trembling , his hair erect , his brow bathed with perspiration , he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart .: 81.35
<S> to you my preserver , perhaps !: 84.50
<S> then he turned again to the clock , counting time now not by minutes , but by seconds .: 166.25
<S> how do you know it is the doctor ? asked valentine , astonished .: 13.10
<S> how did these letters come ? said he .: 39.83
<S> she also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon d artagnan when he spared the life of her brother .: 94.19
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> i forgot to mention to you , said the count , that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment ; those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money , while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me , and among whom it will be divided at my death .: 145.15
<S> they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder ; they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office , nor the corporal with his four men ; and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying .: 173.00
<S> when caderousse turned around , he saw behind him la carconte , paler and trembling more than ever .: 60.84
<S> the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all .: 98.45
<S> then , in spite of the failure of his first search , he began a second , after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids .: 70.06
<S> he was too late ; milady had stabbed herself .: 35.56
<S> bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes .: 39.89
<S> and when he had discharged his two pistols , what a terrible noise he made with his sword !: 62.37
<S> what is this ? asked the captain .: 6.45
<S> but i make war in my own way . the two friends were crouching down , meantime , behind a tub in the side alley .: 83.05
<S> happy beyond measure ! well , i am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health . d artagnan almost leaped with joy .: 92.06
<S> so pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait , and , after that , tell me why i see you in a dress so singular that at first i did not recognize you . dearest valentine , said the young man , the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love , but yet i can not find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul , and tell you how fondly i adore you .: 78.60
<S> his early refinement of character was not only not lost , it grew even greater than ever ; but it was now applied to the little , instead of to the great things of life to the martial condition of the soldier comprised under the head of a good lodging , a rich table , a <UNK> hostess .: 176.03
<S> on the evening of the twenty fifth , as they were entering arras , and as d artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine , a horseman came out of the post yard , where he had just had a relay , started off at a gallop , and with a fresh horse took the road to paris .: 51.94
<S> there is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count ; she insists upon it that i can tell her his birth , education , and <UNK> , where he came from , and whither he is going .: 132.48
<S> on entering the banker s mansion , they perceived the phaeton and servant of m. andrea cavalcanti .: 61.21
<S> beneath these lines was written in another hand : see note above nothing can be done . he compared the writing in the <UNK> with the writing of the certificate placed beneath morrel s petition , and discovered that the note in the <UNK> was the same writing as the certificate that is to say , was in villefort s handwriting .: 206.04
<S> i see they kept their promise . no , monsieur , returned monte cristo upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends .: 72.11
<S> is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden ? cried monte cristo .: 41.88
<S> he opened his eyes .: 7.95
<S> go to the count of monte cristo , avenue des champs e lyse es , on the 26th of may , at seven o clock in the evening , and demand of him your father .: 25.70
<S> one single , solitary light was burning there , and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness ; it was selim s flaming lance .: 270.90
<S> let them hold themselves in readiness to march to night .: 59.15
<S> that s true , replied d artagnan ; i have not the uniform , but i have the spirit .: 21.10
<S> he was right ; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside .: 78.63
<S> while his horses were impatiently <UNK> the ground , held in by the coachman , who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box , the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrance gate , and cast out on the doorsteps m. andrea cavalcanti , as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess .: 111.03
<S> how soft and perfumed was the air ; how lovely the blue heavens and star <UNK> sky !: 805.10
<S> i am a friend . captain groslow ! cried mordaunt .: 35.58
<S> i admire , i love him for i know his former adventures but i shall not speak to him until the day after to morrow . and why day after to morrow ? asked madame de chevreuse .: 48.99
<S> the aldermen did as they had done before , and preceded by their sergeants , advanced to receive their illustrious guest .: 92.34
<S> supposing , also , i should persuade the marquis to give me my capital , which is not likely , but still is possible , we would place these two or three millions in your hands , whose talent might make it realize ten per cent . i never give more than four per cent , and generally only three and a half ; but to my son in law i would give five , and we would share the profits . very good , father in law , said cavalcanti , yielding to his low born nature , which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic <UNK> with which he sought to conceal it .: 84.31
<S> and his name ? said he .: 16.32
<S> then they <UNK> him as they had done the first , laid him on their bed and bound him with the <UNK> which composed the bed the bedstead being of oak .: 177.55
<S> athos is so cool , so brave , and handles his sword so skillfully . no doubt .: 121.44
<S> this reasoning seemed to d artagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted ; and about eight o clock in the evening , the time when the <UNK> of night begin to thicken in the streets , he left the hotel de la chevrette , and followed by planchet set forth from the capital by way of the saint denis gate .: 68.52
<S> i understand , said the child , with that jeering smile which marks especially the <UNK> de paris . well , we must wait . they had not long to wait .: 84.19
<S> <UNK> ne ni no yes , yes , yes , said the old man s eye .: 87.42
<S> pay him , booby ! cried the stranger to his servant , without checking the speed of his horse ; and the man , after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host , galloped after his master .: 105.19
<S> on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes , but covered with rags .: 96.69
<S> did not touch those hearts of stone ; not one man stirred , so monsieur de beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the sun .: 161.93
<S> but how can you continue to receive us ? asked the coadjutor ; if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame . oh , no ! cried scarron , i should compromise you too much . perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant ? i shall borrow from the queen . but her majesty has no property , interposed aramis .: 68.56
<S> each had his own particular visit to make .: 192.48
<S> you , my dear chevalier d herblay , he said , are the fronde incarnate .: 40.84
<S> and besides , if it is not the prince , then monsieur de gondy but monsieur de gondy is to be made a cardinal ; they are soliciting the hat for him . and are there no cardinals that can fight ?: 81.70
<S> well , let us , as you say , go and ask a dinner from the master of that house .: 28.32
<S> he promised to be here , and i have very great faith in planchet , who appears to me to be a very good lad . but if he does not come ? said d artagnan .: 28.79
<S> she was beautiful , but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste ; her hair was <UNK> black , but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious ; her eyes , of the same color as her hair , were surmounted by well arched brows , whose great defect , however , consisted in an almost habitual frown , while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler <UNK> of her sex her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled <UNK> .: 260.02
<S> you prohibited my mentioning my father s name to her , but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital , and you have no idea how delighted i should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips . monte cristo turned to hayde e , and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words , he said in greek , , that is , tell us the fate of your father ; but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason . hayde e sighed deeply , and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow .: 70.25
<S> the count advanced to meet him .: 14.97
<S> andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the bell hotel , which with its triple <UNK> like those of a theatre , with the jessamine and clematis <UNK> round the light columns , forms one of the prettiest <UNK> to an inn that you can imagine .: 321.13
<S> the anger which fired the eyes of the musketeer , in spite of his efforts to <UNK> it , terrified his sensitive <UNK> .: 95.92
<S> oh , aramis ! continued athos , shaking his head mournfully , upon my soul , you make me the most miserable of men ; you <UNK> a heart not wholly dead to friendship .: 92.03
<S> because i would not annoy my little benedetto .: 114.83
<S> if any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an irish gentleman . the sailor departed without reply .: 96.48
<S> not a thought was given to a life which you once , merce de s , had the power to render <UNK> ; not one hour of peaceful calm was mine ; but i felt myself driven on like an exterminating angel .: 192.50
<S> then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand ; and , instead of the lively liquor expected by blaisois and mousqueton , he found beneath his fingers the <UNK> of some coarse powder .: 125.62
<S> come along !: 39.42
<S> in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin ; while on the other side was a black mass of trees , <UNK> on a stormy sky , invaded by large <UNK> clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night .: 161.35
<S> take care that no misfortune <UNK> you when you leave . i thank your majesty , said aramis , but under these robes i have a coat of mail , a pistol and a dagger . go , then , sir , and god keep you ! the king accompanied him to the door , where aramis pronounced his benediction upon him , and passing through the ante rooms , filled with soldiers , jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishop s palace .: 67.53
<S> not so bad yet , replied athos ; for by this time she must have quit the shores of france . d artagnan breathed again .: 44.16
<S> when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight , that grimaud kept bad watch ! cried porthos , who had a great inclination to vent his ill humor on somebody .: 89.26
<S> give it to me . the captain gave him a loaded carbine ; the traveller slowly raised it , and fired in the air .: 71.57
<S> in this garden merce de s had found , at the place indicated by the count , the sum of money which he , through a sense of delicacy , had described as having been placed there twenty four years previously .: 85.53
<S> the groom turned toward him with a look of surprise , but made no reply .: 19.44
<S> then the porter raised some difficulties , but the count of monte cristo produced a permit from the governor of rome , allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night ; the <UNK> was therefore raised , the porter had a louis for his trouble , and they went on their way .: 66.60
<S> come ! but where is the doctor ? exclaimed villefort ; where is he ? madame de villefort now deliberately descended the staircase .: 46.71
<S> however that might have been , the priest , dismounting , led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him .: 90.55
<S> mordaunt , pale and trembling with anger , rushed from the hall sword in hand , followed by six <UNK> , pushing , inquiring and panting in the crowd ; and then , having found nothing , returned .: 84.89
<S> all we require to insure success is courage , and that you possess , and strength , which i am not <UNK> in ; as for patience , you have abundantly proved yours you shall now see me prove mine . one instant , my dear friend , replied the abbe ; it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which i am endowed , and what use i intend making of my strength .: 87.93
<S> franz took it with a nervous trembling , and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively , until he came to m. at that letter the old man signified yes . m , repeated franz .: 94.10
<S> this evening , then , at a quarter to nine at the gate .: 23.25
<S> an idiot , who held the life of lord de winter in his hands and did not kill him , by which i missed three hundred thousand livres income . that s true , said kitty ; your son was the only heir of his uncle , and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his fortune . d artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this <UNK> creature reproach him , with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation , for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindnesses .: 92.25
<S> ah , madame , said comminges , hastening to d artagnan , here is one who can tell you better than myself , for he was my protector .: 27.16
<S> during the day i had nothing to fear .: 15.51
<S> at the moment she entered , the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed , was drawn , and the pale face of the cardinal appeared , he being dressed as a spanish cavalier .: 49.65
<S> love is the most selfish of all the passions .: 82.05
<S> we shall arrive at eight o clock .: 14.18
<S> he is going to fall ! cried morrel .: 15.69
<S> give it to me , said d artagnan , who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket , reckoning upon returning by that gate .: 52.30
<S> in the morning , as he was mounting his horse , d artagnan , who felt at the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke , took planchet aside .: 42.44
<S> i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness .: 28.20
<S> it arose from blows of hammer and hatchet , clinking of pincers and <UNK> of <UNK> .: 584.08
<S> the reason for so publicly announcing all this is , that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits , and , above all , beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance . and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful , are they ? asked franz somewhat <UNK> .: 199.57
<S> when i entered the house , the first thing i beheld in the middle of assunta s chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture , and in it a baby seven or eight months old .: 87.07

<S> if you go out , do not go out alone ; when you eat , use every precaution .: 66.53
<S> if he proves himself worthy of it , i will do what i can to advance his interests .: 60.87
<S> for you and your comrades . this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even porthos ; and this french generosity , repeated by lord de winter and his friend , was highly applauded , except by mm .: 207.95
<S> the gates had opened of themselves , and the king , <UNK> at least , had no other guard at his bed head but his mother .: 119.30
<S> descending into the grotto , he lifted the stone , filled his pockets with gems , put the box together as well and securely as he could , sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken , and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance ; then , quitting the grotto , he replaced the stone , <UNK> on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of <UNK> granite , filling the interstices with earth , into which he <UNK> inserted rapidly growing plants , such as the wild myrtle and <UNK> <UNK> , then carefully <UNK> these new <UNK> , he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps , leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and <UNK> as he had found it .: 284.75
<S> while the struggle between day and night lasted , dante s still doubted ; but as soon as the daylight gained the pre eminence , he saw that he was alone with a corpse .: 91.78

<S> we set forth on our journey . and have you never <UNK> that village ? eagerly asked madame de chevreuse .: 95.33
<S> but i m his cousin ; he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him , and in his place to conduct , wherever they wished to go , the gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner , like that one which you hold and one which i have in my pocket . and he drew out the handkerchief .: 74.25
<S> my fair friend , said athos , allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war .: 30.32
<S> he recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the rue des saints pe res , where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging , and thither he intended conducting the countess .: 163.94
<S> isn t this fox a genius , athos ? asked the gascon .: 90.12
<S> these arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and franz were , and on the other into a large square chamber , entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken .: 85.14
<S> the host recognized him .: 29.38
<S> i have my plan ; let me carry it out and we shall laugh . so much the better , said porthos ; i feel some need of it . hush ! said d artagnan ; the some one is coming . the sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule .: 31.35
<S> the abbess suspects nothing , and believes that i am taken by order of the cardinal .: 86.42
<S> you see he has a truly royal escort . ay , there s no fear in the daytime ; but at night ? we redouble our precautions . and what method of <UNK> do you employ ? eight men remain constantly in his room . the deuce , he is well guarded , then .: 153.78
<S> the queen saw this , and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion , for addressing raoul again : and no evil has happened to the young count de guiche ? she asked ; for not only is he our servant , as you say , sir , but more he is one of our friends . no , madame , replied raoul ; on the contrary , he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness , the prince , on the field of battle . the young princess clapped her hands ; and then , ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy , she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses , as if to inhale their odor .: 79.12
<S> let us talk of something else , said he .: 10.18
<S> in fact , he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words , to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign .: 97.01
<S> kitty , who was to set out that evening for tours , was waiting in the next chamber .: 35.43
<S> yes , my lord , answered the man .: 7.01
<S> and you go in an hour time to eat a morsel , during which i shall send for a post horse . capital !: 66.91
<S> mordaunt was among these .: 120.67
<S> he was no .: 36.31
<S> well , you soon become tired of singing , and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the minister s secretary .: 148.47
<S> but you are here , my dear fellow , let us speak of you .: 11.24
<S> the clerks , who , as it appeared , had <UNK> unusual perfumes in the house , were of military punctuality , and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit down .: 122.51
<S> fight the more for duels being forbidden , since consequently there is twice as much courage in fighting .: 505.78
<S> at the other end of the room , under a white sheet which covered it , lay the corpse , still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard .: 79.35
<S> i did not seek one , i did not ask for one .: 21.35
<S> there , in the twentieth chapter of the life of pope alexander vi. , were the following lines , which i can never forget : the great wars of <UNK> had ended ; c sar borgia , who had completed his conquest , had need of money to purchase all italy .: 167.53
<S> at the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held .: 51.84
<S> quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti , unable to be cardinal , he was obliged to remain a soldier .: 68.36

<S> the ball was given by the count for the particular pleasure of his daughter carmela , whom he adored .: 74.74
<S> a mournful answer awaited each of edmond s eager inquiries as to the information jacopo had obtained .: 270.93
<S> yes . shall i give these papers to m. de villefort ? no . to mademoiselle valentine ? no . to m. franz d e pinay ? yes . franz , astonished , advanced a step .: 32.10
<S> where are you ?: 12.73
<S> the confidence with which d artagnan spoke convinced patrick , which was the name of this minister of the minister .: 52.34
<S> a week before he had received , in a cradle , a beautiful little boy three months old , with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words : <UNK> october , <UNK> it was the date of that strange adventure , interrupted madame de chevreuse .: 163.87
<S> do not let us do things in a hurry .: 37.90
<S> four large vessels , recently built , had just been launched .: 165.24
<S> i am rich , for you have one of the first fortunes in france .: 28.58
<S> i have told you , and i repeat it , that to night we rescue charles i .: 59.27
<S> from whom can come so many <UNK> heaped upon her head , if not from him ?: 193.58
<S> but pray sit down . thank you , said albert , with a cold and formal bow .: 49.66
<S> a door that communicated with the palais de justice was opened , and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors , whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder .: 136.39
<S> forgive my servants , he said , for a terror i can not blame them for ; from being suspected they have become suspicious . madame danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded , but without the evidence of her own <UNK> she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far .: 94.58
<S> the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation , but rather with alacrity , and , mounting the steps at a bound , entered the hotel ; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room .: 64.01
<S> with the hundred pistoles we can live well to the end of the month .: 27.32
<S> we shall serve in a campaign , seek out all sorts of adventures return , in short , to our former life . these last words fell on mousqueton like a thunderbolt .: 135.11
<S> porthos said nothing , but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing .: 84.26
<S> my love , my blood , my life !: 20.85
<S> the four lackeys guarded the door and the window .: 36.15
<S> those studs which the king speaks of , you gave them to the duke of buckingham , did you not ?: 61.13
<S> the king pointed this out .: 93.96
<S> brute ! said danglars .: 37.61
<S> above all , she is very rich , at least , i believe so , said monte cristo .: 22.18
<S> ring , then , if you please , for a second knife , fork , and plate , and we will dine together . indeed ! replied villefort , looking at his father with astonishment , you really do seem very well informed . eh ?: 65.35
<S> all his emotion then burst forth ; he cast himself on the ground , weeping bitterly , and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished .: 87.65
<S> would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger ?: 74.66
<S> my sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure , for she is very partial to the little girl , to whom she intends to be more serviceable hereafter .: 121.82
<S> will your excellency visit saint peter s ? asked the cicerone .: 94.50
<S> so much the better !: 8.35
<S> the queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom .: 66.87
<S> hush ! said the captain ; it is a fire . but you told me the island was uninhabited ? i said there were no fixed <UNK> on it , but i said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers . and for pirates ? and for pirates , returned gaetano , repeating franz s words .: 112.64
<S> personally , i am on bad terms with him , on account of the quarrels between madame de montbazon , my mother in law , and madame de longueville .: 37.73
<S> to the palais royal , he called out .: 22.82
<S> as to the second reproach , i have heard it said that she does not love the english , but an englishman . well , and by my faith , said athos , it must be acknowledged that this englishman is worthy of being loved .: 42.68
<S> you must henceforth be admired and <UNK> as a model of it .: 122.30
<S> i follow you , though i am not hungry . come , if one can t always eat , one can always drink a maxim of poor athos , the truth of which i have discovered since i began to be lonely . d artagnan , who as a gascon , was inclined to sobriety , seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of athos s maxim , but he did his best to keep up with his host .: 69.79
<S> a great age , you mean , monsieur porthos .: 34.14
<S> but danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the <UNK> of the posting master .: 106.43
<S> to horse ! re echoed athos ; everything is arranged and decided . now , gentlemen , cried the king , forward !: 87.61
<S> a thousand livres !: 41.20
<S> then she grasped the front hair , which she also cut off , without expressing the least regret ; on the contrary , her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony eyebrows .: 101.59
<S> the young man s finger , glided over the words , but at each one noirtier answered by a negative sign .: 86.73
<S> the celebrated breviary remained in the family , and was in the count s possession .: 59.53
<S> nothing <UNK> a man more than these devilish strains .: 446.09
<S> i would lay a wager he has stolen it . do you think so ? answered d artagnan , but little convinced , as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was , and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity .: 93.81
<S> but it s all my fault ; yes , it s all my fault , because it is myself who <UNK> my men .: 64.16
<S> two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand ; but albert , a first rate <UNK> , sent them rolling in the street , one after the other , and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo .: 101.43
<S> but are you no longer aware , continued anne , giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will , that in former days the queen had once need of a young , brave and devoted cavalier that she found this cavalier and that , although he might have thought that she had forgotten him , she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart ? no , madame , i was ignorant of that , said the musketeer .: 55.54
<S> but the soil was moist ; on reaching the top of the bank , she slipped and fell upon her knees .: 54.57
<S> fire !: 52.80
<S> the marechal de grammont and the comte de guiche had returned to paris and he was quite lonely .: 26.35
<S> i have a jolly little circle of witty abbe s and pretty women ; everything goes on smoothly , so certainly , dear friend , i shall not meddle in politics . well , listen , my dear aramis , said d artagnan ; your philosophy convinces me , on my honor .: 90.69
<S> they are binding her ; they are going to drag her away , cried d artagnan to himself , springing up from the floor .: 47.36
<S> then why did you smile ? why , you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself , valentine . do you want me to go away ? ah , no , no .: 27.68
<S> that evening milady was still more impatient than on the preceding evening .: 48.02
<S> is it not a curious affair ? so curious , that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for <UNK> of character . not at all ; we have received with the information all the requisite proofs , and we are quite sure m. de morcerf will not raise his voice against us ; besides , it is rendering a service to one s country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them . beauchamp was thunderstruck .: 114.28
<S> he found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughter s grave .: 86.48
<S> yes , count , replied villefort , in a voice now scarcely human .: 31.62
<S> assassinate the duke of buckingham , or cause him to be assassinated i care very little about that !: 139.89
<S> but how have you become acquainted with all these details ? asked the president .: 18.25
<S> the only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit .: 268.12
<S> is treated at the court of france . monsieur aramis is not an officer ? asked the queen of lord de winter .: 33.01
<S> parry , who accompanied him , stood behind him .: 32.60
<S> even if you gained the yard , there would still be three iron gates for you to pass .: 135.93
<S> obey , laporte , do you not see i have no time to lose ? laporte broke the seal , and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke ; but buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing .: 47.56
<S> these proceedings made d artagnan and porthos draw back .: 104.59
<S> he pushed the door open and entered .: 24.75
<S> we have made considerable advances ; and this very morning the surgeon declared that if monsieur porthos did not pay him , he should look to me , as it was i who had sent for him . porthos is wounded , then ? i can not tell you , monsieur . what !: 42.20
<S> instead of striking between the sixth and seventh left ribs , as your countrymen do , you must have struck higher or lower , and life is very tenacious in these lawyers , or rather there is no truth in anything you have told me it was a fright of the imagination , a dream of your fancy .: 177.96
<S> without this , danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time , for daylight did not reach his cell .: 55.53
<S> you look at me and you are going to laugh at me . no , on the contrary , i am not inclined to laugh , said athos , suppressing a sigh .: 23.56
<S> i owe you some explanations for my conduct , and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me , i will give them .: 50.84
<S> in other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage , and the <UNK> of two old oak trees , the refuge of the <UNK> , startled by the travelers , were in deep shadow .: 127.20
<S> on my part , i will go out with my hands in my pockets , that nothing may be suspected .: 28.73
<S> if he detested her , it would be all the better , replied athos .: 25.46
<S> mazarin rose .: 24.82
<S> the soldiers , pushed back by these living walls , were in danger of being crushed against the <UNK> of the wheels and the panels of the carriages .: 102.64
<S> yes there are , and most hideous , or rather most admirable ones , for i found them ugly enough to frighten me . come , my dear albert , said debray , confess that your cook is <UNK> , that the oysters have not arrived from <UNK> or <UNK> , and that , like madame de <UNK> , you are going to replace the dish by a story .: 124.10
<S> deuce take it !: 74.28
<S> d artagnan made his way through the crowd , advanced toward the host , and pronounced the word forward ! the host instantly made him a sign to follow , went out with him by a door which opened into a yard , led him to the stable , where a saddled horse awaited him , and asked him if he stood in need of anything else .: 45.45
<S> mousqueton ! exclaimed d artagnan , draw up the blinds of his majesty s carriage . it is he ! cried porthos .: 21.19
<S> anne of austria , who , in consequence of the <UNK> of her letter , expected reproaches , was much astonished the next day to see the king make some attempts at reconciliation with her .: 96.94
<S> the sound of his voice was at once penetrating and melodious ; and then , that which was inconceivable in athos , who was always retiring , was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the usages of the most brilliant society those manners of a high degree which appeared , as if unconsciously to himself , in his least actions .: 138.72
<S> no , he is a countryman of yours , if a corsican is a countryman of anyone s .: 93.67
<S> a poor musketeer , a beggar , an unknown who hates slavery , and finds himself ill placed in the world . aramis , aramis ! cried d artagnan , looking at his friend with an air of doubt .: 55.62
<S> pardieu ! said he , here is a strange thing !: 11.08
<S> he concluded by calling for an investigation , which might dispose of the <UNK> report before it had time to spread , and restore m. de morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion .: 182.45
<S> they did not even acquaint me with their intentions , and i only discovered them by chance , that is why i have been so reserved with you , dear grandpapa .: 53.87
<S> open , sir , she said , and look for yourself . mazarin opened the coffer ; a knife , covered with rust , and two letters , one of which was stained with blood , alone met his gaze .: 58.67
<S> upon gaining this advantage d artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise ; it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor , it was a woman !: 75.26
<S> what do you mean by a struggle ?: 20.13
<S> his heart beat , but not like d artagnan s with a young and impatient love .: 105.27
<S> now , he continued , withdraw a little and let me say my prayer , i beseech you .: 43.48
<S> why , three days ago the emperor had not landed . no matter , i was aware of his intention . how did you know about it ? by a letter addressed to you from the island of elba . to me ? to you ; and which i discovered in the pocket book of the messenger .: 50.35
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> the bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of jean jacques <UNK> , you remember , the <UNK> who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger .: 316.25
<S> no , said porthos , i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood , who have just sent me word they could not come .: 44.71
<S> an old proverb says , like master , like man . let us pass , then , from the valet of athos to the valet of porthos , from grimaud to mousqueton .: 77.63
<S> oh , quite the contrary , dear friend , i swear ; and as a proof of what i say , permit me to declare i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound . ah , he ll come round , thought d artagnan ; that s not bad ! this gentleman , who is my friend , has just escaped from a serious danger , continued aramis , with <UNK> , pointing to d artagnan with his hand , and addressing the two ecclesiastics .: 55.24
<S> the horses , impelled by fear , flew towards the house .: 53.02
<S> every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle , when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day .: 190.56
<S> mordaunt , he cried .: 25.66
<S> oh , cried edmond , to think that in half an hour i could join her , did i not fear being questioned , detected , and conveyed back to marseilles !: 87.01
<S> the queen attributed this joyous feeling to the beauty of the fe te , to the pleasure she had experienced in the ballet ; and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen , whether she smile or weep , everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of the city of paris .: 122.85
<S> this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage ; and when he had bound the scarf around his waist , and when his hat , placed <UNK> on one side , let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons , franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations .: 182.44
<S> where ? in that box . no , replied the countess , it was certainly empty during the first act ; then , resuming the subject of their previous conversation , she said , and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize ? i am sure of it . and who afterwards sent the cup to me ? undoubtedly . but i don t know him , said the countess ; i have a great mind to return it . do no such thing , i beg of you ; he would only send you another , formed of a magnificent sapphire , or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby .: 61.90
<S> and then , you ungrateful being , you are not pleased to see an old friend ?: 55.82
<S> i have , replied morrel .: 15.25
<S> depend on my care to see that your youth is not blighted , or suffered to pass away in <UNK> solitude ; and of this be well assured , that if you love me as a father , i love you as a child . you are wrong , my lord .: 75.37
<S> oh , madame , said the count , when valentine had left the room , was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away ? by no means , replied the young lady quickly ; but this is the hour when we usually give m. noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his <UNK> existence .: 63.33
<S> we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance .: 84.24
<S> she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven .: 101.01
<S> but hear me , continued she .: 37.05
<S> you are convinced now , edmond , are you not ? asked the abbe .: 17.82
<S> let them know , on the contrary , that their punishment , which had been decreed by providence , is only delayed by my present determination , and although they escape it in this world , it awaits them in another , and that they are only exchanging time for eternity . while he was thus agitated by gloomy <UNK> , wretched waking dreams of grief , the first rays of morning pierced his windows , and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence .: 129.24
<S> had old <UNK> appeared at this moment , he would have been proclaimed king of the moccoli , and <UNK> the heir <UNK> to the throne .: 218.00
<S> i hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place , nor should i accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were left to us , but our estates are confiscated , our ready money is exhausted , and we are reduced to turn to service everything we possess .: 142.16
<S> everything in her mind was lost for an instant ; when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order .: 56.08
<S> as to the rest of the blade , the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a <UNK> pin .: 123.57
<S> he now wished to be amongst them , in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer ; he sighed for the galleys , with the infamous costume , the chain , and the brand on the shoulder .: 75.34
<S> you were still fast asleep , and i did not know what to do with myself ; i was still stupid from our yesterday s <UNK> .: 90.84
<S> i am rejoiced to hear you speak of monsieur d emery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity .: 206.07
<S> there is one comfort , we are all in cash , said d artagnan .: 39.65
<S> have you wanted money , father ? i want nothing now that i have you , said the old man .: 36.00
<S> the country was beautiful , <UNK> by <UNK> as green as the emerald .: 242.03
<S> well , said villefort , what is it ? who rang ? who asked for me ? a stranger who will not send in his name . a stranger who will not send in his name !: 53.31
<S> valentine , whose heart is pure as a diamond or a <UNK> ! no pity , procureur ; the crime is fragrant .: 171.76
<S> bonacieux s glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quickness .: 156.68
<S> besides , we will have no words about it .: 31.28
<S> it is you , monsieur d artagnan , she said , fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer , and i know you well .: 29.11
<S> lord winter answers for his regiment , or at least very nearly so we will not split <UNK> about words let him place himself at the head of his men , we will place ourselves at the side of your majesty , and we will mow a <UNK> through cromwell s army and reach scotland . there is another method , said aramis .: 127.18
<S> has not your excellency heard that the french charge d <UNK> was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of <UNK> ? oh , yes , i heard that . well , then , if , like us , your excellency lived at leghorn , you would hear , from time to time , that a little merchant vessel , or an english yacht that was expected at bastia , at porto ferrajo , or at civita vecchia , has not arrived ; no one knows what has become of it , but , doubtless , it has struck on a rock and foundered .: 101.64
<S> follow me , said an officer , who came up behind the guards .: 33.82
<S> lord de winter had announced her embarkation for the twenty third , and it was now the morning of the twenty second .: 60.17
<S> danglars signature chapter 105 .: 355.55
<S> so , so , replied porthos .: 21.18
<S> eh ? said he , showing it .: 25.95
<S> now , said the count , let us follow him . franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path , which , at the distance of a hundred paces , led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley .: 37.51
<S> will they never bring that emetic ? asked the doctor .: 58.20
<S> whom does this belong to ? he inquired .: 88.28
<S> he touched him on the shoulder .: 18.13
<S> he used to weep , he now laughs ; he grew thin , he now grows fat .: 284.95
<S> see !: 35.16
<S> be brave , faithful and loyal , he said , you are brave , faithful and loyal .: 50.11
<S> i will go , said comminges ; and if they come back , fire ! not at all not at all , replied d artagnan ; let no one move .: 34.58
<S> grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of vincennes .: 228.97
<S> he had assumed the entire costume of cucumetto .: 53.70
<S> oh , i remember , said d artagnan .: 7.46
<S> you see someone pays me a visit .: 64.77
<S> by whom ? by the gentleman who was here yesterday .: 40.53
<S> so you and the cardinal have been talking about me ?: 57.12
<S> she was my mother !: 43.21
<S> pardon me , my friend . we will see about that presently , said d artagnan , with a slight smile .: 18.52
<S> good bye , then . good bye , till we meet again . they had arrived in the champs e lyse es .: 25.27

<S> i waited a month , or rather i suffered for a month !: 59.47
<S> diplomat or not , i don t know ; i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission , which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction , that had i been king , i should have instantly created him knight of all my orders , even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter . well , since we are not to sit down to table , said debray , take a glass of sherry , and tell us all about it . you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa . it is a road your ancestors have traced for you , said albert gallantly .: 65.90
<S> the instant she appeared the door keeper rose , came to her , and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment ; and on her affirmative answer being given , he conducted her by a private passage to m. de villefort s office .: 66.78
<S> go on ! count , said morrel , you are the <UNK> of all human knowledge , and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than ours . there is something true in what you say , said the count , with that smile which made him so handsome ; i have descended from a <UNK> called grief . <UNK> i believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning ; for instance , you told me to live , and i did live ; you told me to hope , and i almost did so .: 84.87
<S> as he gained the top of the rue gue <UNK> , he saw two persons coming out of the rue dauphine whose appearance very much struck him .: 129.94

<S> i do not know a woman that is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost .: 44.33
<S> merce de s extended her hand to the count .: 12.16

<S> dante s inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid , and pressing with all his force on the handle , burst open the fastenings .: 85.45
<S> debray , maximilian morrel , and m. de cha teau renaud . did they speak of me ? not a word . so much the worse . why so ?: 23.79
<S> i love you as my life , for you are the best , the noblest of created beings ! <UNK> let it be , then , as you wish , sweet angel ; god has sustained me in my struggle with my enemies , and has given me this reward ; he will not let me end my triumph in suffering ; i wished to punish myself , but he has pardoned me .: 78.22
<S> you have the window , that is sufficient .: 30.30
<S> monsieur <UNK> , if you please , my good woman , replied andrea .: 42.93

<S> besides , mother , remark how vivid his eye , how <UNK> black his hair , and his brow , though so pale , is free from wrinkles , he is not only vigorous , but also young . the countess bent her head , as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts .: 138.14
<S> what name did you pronounce then , madame de morcerf ? said he .: 25.75
<S> oblige me by taking a seat , said d artagnan , pushing a chair toward mordaunt , who sat down , pale but calm .: 53.52
<S> he could not understand how albert s fiery nature , of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits , had suddenly stooped to this humiliation .: 85.73
<S> with what my father said just now ? he returned a sign in the negative .: 57.39
<S> they were untouched ; the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers pocket , and in that of his greatcoat he found the little note case containing his letter of credit for 5,050,000 francs .: 181.23
<S> three months passed away .: 25.98
<S> a friend , maximilian ; and who is this friend ?: 33.80
<S> france is so prosaic , and paris so civilized a city , that you will not find in its eighty five <UNK> i say eighty five , because i do not include corsica you will not find , then , in these eighty five <UNK> a single hill on which there is not a telegraph , or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a <UNK> .: 195.03
<S> but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago , which is generally but too fatal . but who , then , is this assassin , this murderer ? let me also ask you a question .: 147.23
<S> you have lived on the money he has given you . true , said caderousse ; benedetto has become the son of a great lord . how can he be the son of a great lord ? a natural son . and what is that great lord s name ? the count of monte cristo , the very same in whose house we are . benedetto the count s son ? replied monte cristo , astonished in his turn .: 39.92
<S> have you tied the knot ? inquired the first speaker .: 101.79
<S> nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dante s ; the very paper was different , while the articles of <UNK> furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmond s time had all disappeared ; the four walls alone remained as he had left them .: 112.82
<S> after so many years of painful separation , said andrea , in the same tone of voice , and glancing towards the door , what a happiness it is to meet again ! indeed it is , after so long a separation . will you not embrace me , sir ? said andrea .: 57.83
<S> and yet it appears , in spite of all your diligence , you have arrived too late . you see ! said athos , pointing to mme .: 32.78

<S> your quarrels with the parliament , your noisy dissensions with the princes , who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you , the popular following directed by the coadjutor , president blancmesnil , and councillor broussel all that disorder , in short , which <UNK> the several <UNK> of the state , must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war ; for in that event england , exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas , will ally herself with spain , already seeking that alliance .: 254.08
<S> i have been waiting for a long time to tell him what i think of him .: 13.65
<S> already rich , he held a high official situation , though only twenty seven .: 380.62
<S> the duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax , even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its <UNK> by force of arms .: 90.84

<S> he was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse .: 148.36
<S> and we say , proud as a gascon , replied d artagnan .: 23.83
<S> will your eminence please read and examine ? i am acquainted with it . sign it , then . reflect , gentlemen , that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence . monseigneur will be at hand to <UNK> that it was freely given . suppose i refuse ? then , said d artagnan , your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal . would you dare to touch a cardinal ? you have dared , my lord , to imprison her majesty s musketeers . the queen will revenge me , gentlemen . i do not think so , although inclination might lead her to do so , but we shall take your eminence to paris , and the parisians will defend us . how uneasy they must be at this moment at rueil and saint germain , said aramis .: 82.38
<S> he was <UNK> , tended , cured ; and one fine morning , in better health than ever before , he set out for france .: 214.48
<S> good lord ! said d artagnan , who , as we have often said , never stumbled at anything .: 34.25
<S> we will take possession of it and cut the cable .: 36.00
<S> yes , replied the stranger .: 7.35
<S> from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie , from the rue saint <UNK> du louvre to the pont neuf , from the rue richelieu to the porte saint honore , there were more than ten thousand armed men ; those who were at the front <UNK> defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the palais royal , the gates of which were closed behind them , a precaution which made their situation precarious .: 115.43
<S> oh , yes , sir , you are right it is fatality ! the minister <UNK> before this outburst of sarcasm .: 105.85
<S> they reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were , and the study in which they ought to have been .: 45.25
<S> do not seek to know how i discovered it ; i know it that is sufficient .: 37.75
<S> i know that porthos was in a fair way , replied d artagnan ; and as to aramis to tell you the truth , i have never been seriously uneasy on his account .: 27.96
<S> come , and i will explain to you . and with a firm step morrel went up to his study , while maximilian followed him , trembling as he went .: 25.69
<S> is anyone ill in the house ? the eyes of noirtier seemed as though they would start from their sockets .: 60.55
<S> i am about to struggle for the last time with them .: 24.98
<S> drops of perspiration trickled down his face , and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to <UNK> away the blood that <UNK> from it .: 116.82
<S> i wish i had never seen you ! cried d artagnan , with that ingenuous <UNK> which women often prefer to the <UNK> of politeness , because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason .: 173.79
<S> in another hour every light in the house was extinguished , and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept .: 83.78
<S> then , after a moment of reverie , he remembered where he had left d artagnan and porthos and that they must have overheard everything .: 31.13
<S> they were <UNK> , cleopatra , messalina , those three celebrated <UNK> .: 783.04
<S> the terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her ; she shuddered , and yet had not strength to utter a word .: 83.86
<S> only , as our gascon was not easily intimidated or rather , thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country , he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear he placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards , and waited with his hand on his hip , in an attitude by no means <UNK> in majesty .: 120.84
<S> i had such a delightful dream .: 49.19
<S> pardon me , i love him so much ! these two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace .: 51.90
<S> let us put down <UNK> , added albert , smiling .: 71.29
<S> ha , ha , ha ! she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh , her arms stiffened and twisted , her head fell back on her chair , and she remained motionless .: 63.17
<S> so much the better ; it proves that we know how to keep our secrets . i do not reproach you , monsieur , said d artagnan ; tis only because monsieur de la fere has spoken of friendship that i question your conduct . and what do you find in it that is worthy of blame ? asked aramis , haughtily .: 45.10
<S> it was granted , and was to take place after her morning s <UNK> , at which , in accordance with his rights of birth , he was entitled to be present .: 68.93
<S> d artagnan ! cried athos , my son , i entreat you ; the wretch is dying , and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him .: 52.28
<S> my faith !: 16.94
<S> in which m. se guier , keeper of the seals , looks more than once for the bell it is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made upon louis xiii .: 171.79

<S> d artagnan , finding a lantern on the deck , took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain , in english , come , being , with the classic english oath , the only english words he knew , and so saying he descended to the lower deck .: 72.22
<S> all i have is at his service . the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper ; then , observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded , he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show , and therefore said , speaking with a strong italian accent , you are , i presume , m. caderousse ? yes , sir , answered the host , even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it ; i am gaspard caderousse , at your service . gaspard caderousse , rejoined the priest .: 132.13
<S> there is no situation , however terrible it may be , which can authorize a creature of god to inflict death upon himself .: 136.33

<S> there , said d artagnan , this is capital !: 12.54
<S> france refuse hospitality to an unfortunate prince ?: 510.41
<S> no , replied beauchamp , i have not considered the question ; a totally different subject interests me . what is it ? the article relative to morcerf . indeed ?: 74.37
<S> and no one thinks of us in this country , for each must think about his own affairs .: 84.88
<S> villequier , said guitant .: 186.57
<S> what is it ? asked d artagnan , who did not at all comprehend the hilarity of his friend .: 10.72
<S> but when is this ball to take place ? monday next . monday next !: 299.35
<S> all the events we have described had taken place within a half hour .: 34.47

<S> spada turned pale , as c sar looked at him with an ironical air , which proved that he had anticipated all , and that the snare was well spread .: 49.33
<S> in your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality . enter the guardroom , said the sergeant ; we will lay your case before the commandant of the post . the guardroom was filled with citizens and common people , some playing , some drinking , some talking .: 261.52
<S> de monte cristo receives my apology .: 200.74
<S> at all events , if you want me , remember the rue tiquetonne , hotel de la chevrette . and i shall be at the convent of jesuits ; from six in the morning to eight at night come by the door .: 49.57
<S> morrel followed him , and looked also for his sister and brother in law ; he soon discovered them in another box , and kissed his hand to them .: 46.68
<S> however , there are plenty in the world , but you don t look in the right direction for them , my lord . indeed !: 36.50
<S> then grimaud , lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room , to the horror of all present , made a sign to the host to follow him , paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse .: 72.74
<S> and you were right , cried aramis and porthos , with one voice .: 23.32
<S> i offered to pay them for <UNK> the lease ; they demanded 6,000 francs .: 301.43

<S> each time he had been brought into contact with his father , something terrible had happened .: 65.96
<S> the crisis seemed past , a low moaning was heard , and he raised himself on one knee .: 76.69
<S> at length they arrived at the famous room .: 20.65
<S> he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome , although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty .: 274.26
<S> they are aiming they are going to fire ! they have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach the palais royal ! exclaimed mazarin .: 91.81
<S> it seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always dined . oh !: 54.16
<S> that s well .: 16.02
<S> mine , also , are from him ! indeed , sir , i recognize you ; you are captain mordaunt . mordaunt was startled .: 72.85

<S> in the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized cocles ; but as he had but one eye , and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years , cocles did not recognize the count .: 80.58
<S> all at once felton stopped .: 48.62
<S> madame de villefort is ill. <UNK> but mademoiselle de villefort stammered the nurse .: 145.25
<S> let us try not to find them out by accident , but from our notions .: 64.40
<S> they had understood each other without speaking .: 42.56
<S> the procureur then told his wife to come up .: 33.87
<S> farewell , till the next time we meet , cried chatillon , and he set off , full gallop .: 55.23

<S> we will embrace raoul , and perhaps he will have news of athos . stop an idea ! cried porthos ; indeed , my dear d artagnan , i don t know how you manage , but you are always full of ideas ; let us go and embrace raoul . woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment , said mousqueton to himself ; i wouldn t give a <UNK> for his life . they set out .: 54.38
<S> i could not defer my pleasure , so i took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealer s .: 93.19
<S> the boat is waiting for us ; come . besides , said aramis , what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time ?: 65.16
<S> listen ; i am already upon the scent , resumed d artagnan .: 36.72
<S> then began his travels , his duels , his caprices ; then the insurrection in greece broke out , and he had served in the grecian ranks .: 197.06
<S> now the four friends began to speak loud , scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began , and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table .: 155.43
<S> but first , let hayde e be informed that i have returned . here i am , said the young girl , who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return safely .: 53.55
<S> what is become of her ?: 28.30
<S> monsieur !: 26.79
<S> u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff .: 93.72
<S> for instance , having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m. noirtier , i resolved to try one last means , and for three months i have been giving him brucine ; so that in the last dose i ordered for him there were six <UNK> .: 173.92
<S> ah madame danglars had risen , and stood before the procureur , whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp .: 111.86
<S> then turning toward the second musketeer , d artagnan said : monsieur du verger , help me to place this man in a place of safety . the musketeer , thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise , bowed , and drawing his sword , signified that he was ready .: 52.48
<S> in the first place , i warn you that that letter is for monsieur de tre ville , and it must be found , or if it is not found , he will know how to find it . his threat completed the <UNK> of the host .: 33.36
<S> moreover , in defending ourselves , we shall cover ourselves with glory .: 160.29
<S> where are you going , marechal ? asked the queen .: 13.52
<S> as bertuccio , with a respectful bow , was moving away , the count called him back .: 72.27
<S> but what s going on in the city yonder ? said athos .: 43.39
<S> that gentleman , your friend , defended himself desperately .: 138.05
<S> it is the longest road , but certainly the most amusing . d artagnan was on the point of telling athos all ; but one consideration restrained him .: 86.41
<S> andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door ; the groom , in every respect a <UNK> of the english fashion , was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron gray horse .: 91.51
<S> why , what good would it do ? asked caderousse .: 30.59
<S> at the end of half an hour or thereabouts , a clerk came to put an end to his tortures , but not to his anxiety , by giving the order to conduct m. bonacieux to the chamber of examination .: 59.05
<S> they had , besides , to look constantly to their own proper safety ; milady was a phantom which , when it had once appeared to people , did not allow them to sleep very quietly .: 113.87
<S> the servant announced m. albert de morcerf .: 56.24
<S> i call on you where are you ?: 53.79
<S> the idea of thinking ministers understand anything about princes ! there is something in what you have just said , said beauchamp , laughing .: 96.93
<S> the two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air .: 80.57
<S> d artagnan , however , could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments , not enough to distinguish her features .: 59.95
<S> this time the illusion , or rather the reality , surpassed anything valentine had before experienced ; she began to believe herself really alive and awake , and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder .: 189.15
<S> it is a folly , i admit , but still it is the fashion .: 29.47
<S> athos dwelt in the rue fe rou , within two steps of the luxembourg .: 31.85
<S> are you also in accord with spain and england , with madame de chevreuse and the queen ? sire , replied the cardinal , sighing , i believed myself secure from such a suspicion . monsieur cardinal , you have heard me ; i will have those letters . there is but one way . what is that ? that would be to charge monsieur de se guier , the keeper of the seals , with this mission .: 60.03
<S> danglars instantly descended ; although he did not yet speak italian , he understood it very well .: 85.10
<S> i live retired in the house of my noble protector , but i do it from choice .: 107.42
<S> besides , if he will do nothing <UNK> , he will answer any questions you propose to him .: 78.32

<S> the trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the street door .: 40.06
<S> it was no longer a rival who was beloved ; it was himself who was apparently beloved .: 69.79
<S> come , then , as early as you like at seven o clock ; but beware , if you and your musketeers are guilty . if my musketeers are guilty , sire , the guilty shall be placed in your majesty s hands , who will dispose of them at your good pleasure .: 54.45
<S> ten minutes after she pitched forward , then the other way , <UNK> round and round , and then good bye to the pharaon .: 177.66
<S> d artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object , which she unfolded quickly , and which took the form of a handkerchief .: 47.51
<S> that s right , said athos ; put your other hand here . and he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support , so that his head almost touched that of mordaunt ; and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers .: 120.43
<S> but listen to me listen and you will pity me who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief i am about to reveal , without casting the least portion upon you . oh , you frighten me !: 101.39
<S> ah ! said the coadjutor , you are avaricious , my good fellow . the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag .: 28.28
<S> it was the abode of the little abbe scarron .: 24.93
<S> ah , monsieur porthos , cried the procurator s wife , when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the <UNK> could either see or hear her , ah , monsieur porthos , you are a great conqueror , as it appears ! i , madame ? said porthos , drawing himself up proudly ; how so ? the signs just now , and the holy water !: 64.52
<S> ah , yes , it is true , murmured d avrigny .: 8.73
<S> besides , you can tell them that you have full confidence in me , and they will not be more incredulous than you . i can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days , that is all to athos , whose wound still makes him suffer , to go to the waters of forges ; to porthos and aramis to accompany their friend , whom they are not willing to abandon in such a painful condition .: 56.98
<S> bonacieux , darting at her the most loving glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little person ; and while he descended the stairs , he heard the door closed and double locked .: 83.43
<S> the project gutenberg ebook of the three musketeers this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the united states and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever .: 23.40
<S> where did you place it ?: 30.79
<S> oh , how charitable , kind , and good you are ; you affect this gayety to inspire me with courage . you are wrong , morrel ; i was really happy . then you forget me , so much the better . how so ? yes ; for as the gladiator said to the emperor , when he entered the arena , he who is about to die salutes you . then you are not consoled ? asked the count , surprised .: 63.03
<S> the king s closet at the tuileries we will leave villefort on the road to paris , travelling thanks to <UNK> fees with all speed , and passing through two or three apartments , enter at the tuileries the little room with the arched window , so well known as having been the favorite closet of napoleon and louis xviii. , and now of louis <UNK> .: 145.86
<S> come instantly , pray come ! madame , madame ! cried valentine , calling her step mother , and running upstairs to meet her ; come quick , quick ! and bring your bottle of smelling salts with you . what is the matter ? said madame de villefort in a harsh and constrained tone .: 73.19
<S> the lackeys followed , armed to the teeth .: 59.17
<S> the young man is here , said the valet de chambre in the same tone .: 13.81
<S> well , then , said mordaunt , i choose for my adversary the man who , not thinking himself worthy to be called comte de la fere , calls himself athos . athos sprang up , but after an instant of motionless silence he said , to the astonishment of his friends , monsieur mordaunt , a duel between us is impossible .: 59.79
<S> we , on our side , do the same .: 33.11
<S> let us do justice to d artagnan .: 21.36
<S> hunting for the equipments chapter <UNK> .: 332.35
<S> they were , one in the rue de vaugirard , no .: 22.11
<S> my good dame , asked d artagnan , can you tell me what has become of one of my friends , whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen days ago ? a handsome young man , three or four and twenty years old , mild , amiable , and well made ? that is he wounded in the shoulder . just so .: 42.86
<S> it seems a likely story to me . and to me , too . besides , we can but blow out his brains if he proves false , said the gascon ; and you , athos , you know something of everything and can be our captain .: 71.22
<S> ere the cardinal , your predecessor , sent our mother , marie de medicis , to die in exile , she taught us that language .: 133.25
<S> no , monsieur , he has not a lady with him . with whom is he , then ? with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits of amiens . good heavens ! cried d artagnan , is the poor fellow worse , then ? no , monsieur , quite the contrary ; but after his illness grace touched him , and he determined to take orders . that s it ! said d artagnan , i had forgotten that he was only a musketeer for a time . monsieur still insists upon seeing him ? more than ever . well , monsieur has only to take the right hand staircase in the courtyard , and knock at number five on the second floor . d artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated , and found one of those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our old fashioned <UNK> .: 59.27
<S> decidedly , athos , you were born to be a general , and the cardinal , who fancies himself a great soldier , is nothing beside you . gentlemen , said athos , no divided attention , i beg ; let each one pick out his man . i cover mine , said d artagnan .: 83.88
<S> go there ? murmured julie .: 68.03
<S> poor cardinal !: 35.77
<S> a table , which had been covered with an elegant supper , was overturned .: 67.55
<S> this quantity , which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of m. noirtier , which has become gradually accustomed to it , would be sufficient to kill another person . my dear doctor , there is no communication between m. noirtier s apartment and that of madame de saint me ran , and barrois never entered my mother in law s room .: 55.17
<S> d artagnan , placed in line with his company , saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends , whose eyes soon discovered him , and m. de tre ville , who detected him at once .: 54.97
<S> he recovered a little , reopened his eyes , and hope revived in all hearts .: 105.72
<S> should she forsake mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side ; but you know better than i do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon mazarin . perhaps you are right , said aramis , thoughtfully ; therefore i shall not pledge myself . to them or to us , do you mean , aramis ? to no one .: 92.02
<S> and how many men had he with him ? i do not know , sire , answered the minister of police .: 17.45
<S> all my hopes are blighted , my heart is broken , my life a burden , everything around me is sad and mournful ; earth has become distasteful to me , and human voices distract me .: 183.91
<S> the retreat of rocca bianca was at the top of a small mountain , which no doubt in former days had been a volcano an extinct volcano before the days when <UNK> and <UNK> had deserted <UNK> to come and found the city of rome .: 247.72
<S> then morrel came out from his hiding place with a beating heart , and looked through the small opening in the gate ; there was yet no one to be seen .: 52.19
<S> no , she must have conceived some pathetic scene ; she will come and throw herself between us ; and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous . the blush of pride mounted to the count s forehead as this thought passed through his mind .: 112.72
<S> the lemonade morrel was , in fact , very happy .: 65.06
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> the worthy sergeant had recognized the minister s secretary and the <UNK> , and , by way of paying extra attention to his noble neighbors , promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to beauchamp .: 129.07
<S> still five days before us .: 79.01
<S> the company of french guards was composed of half of m. duhallier s men and half of m. dessessart s men .: 211.92
<S> the morrel family chapter 51 .: 213.50
<S> take these flowers into the anteroom or dressing room , said the viscount ; they make the countess ill. the footman obeyed his orders .: 253.54
<S> then , taking the glass with a firm hand , she said , drink .: 37.76
<S> two angelic faces .: 670.13
<S> haste to him and warn him , cried the wounded man , if he still lives ; warn his friends , too .: 117.93
<S> m. coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further ; but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon porthos , he contented himself with saying , monsieur our cousin will do us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the campaign , will he not , madame coquenard ? this time porthos received the blow right in his stomach , and felt it .: 128.70
<S> oh , mother , he exclaimed , such a misfortune has happened ! what ?: 22.06
<S> remember that i write to you now to repeat how much affection for you i still cherish .: 149.35
<S> it was , then , in the neighborhood of noyon that he must seek that estate .: 44.61
<S> someone has vexed you ; i will allow no one to annoy you . you are deceived , lucien , i assure you , replied madame danglars ; and what i have told you is really the case , added to the ill humor you remarked , but which i did not think it worth while to allude to . it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves ; or that , as debray had guessed , she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone .: 89.08
<S> on one of those immense staircases , upon whose space modern civilization would build a whole house , ascended and descended the office seekers of paris , who ran after any sort of favor gentlemen from the provinces anxious to be <UNK> , and servants in all sorts of liveries , bringing and carrying messages between their masters and m. de tre ville .: 271.42
<S> for the present , i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness danglars excuse my impatience , my dear count , but a client like you is almost like a member of the family . monte cristo bowed , in sign that he accepted the <UNK> honor ; danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a <UNK> livery .: 121.90
<S> what !: 14.83
<S> we are observed ; they are coming to meet us .: 22.64
<S> i thought you wished them to forget you ? if they did not speak of me , i am sure they thought about me , and i am in despair . how will that affect you , since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you ?: 52.36
<S> we have cruelly wounded , as you know , that personal pride by which d artagnan is blindly governed .: 176.23
<S> but , said caderousse , again smiling with the disagreeable expression he had before assumed , you must pay for it you understand ? well , what do you want ? i think that with a hundred francs a month well ? i could live upon a hundred francs ! come you understand me ; but that with with ? with a hundred and fifty francs i should be quite happy . here are two hundred , said andrea ; and he placed ten gold louis in the hand of caderousse .: 58.46
<S> de chevreuse and mme .: 21.65
<S> no , sir .: 10.74
<S> the comte de la fere ! he cried in his turn .: 6.98
<S> how ?: 28.72
<S> you have purchased it dearly enough . d artagnan left athos s chamber and went to that of porthos .: 46.79
<S> be satisfied , all who are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve , even the queen herself . what do you say , sire ?: 53.47
<S> just so .: 79.72
<S> if i am happy in an error , do not have the cruelty to lift me from it .: 57.38
<S> he alone would have any influence with them ; i do not even know them under their true names . you suspect me , monsieur de rochefort ; i want him and you and all to aid me . begin with me , my lord ; for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to one s destination . you , my dear monsieur de rochefort , shall have the post of confidence ; you shall go to vincennes , where monsieur de beaufort is confined ; you will guard him well for me .: 60.25
<S> the demon had known how to wound him .: 180.42
<S> who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dante s ? every eye was turned towards the young man who , spite of the agitation he could not but feel , advanced with dignity , and said , in a firm voice : i am he ; what is your pleasure with me ? edmond dante s , replied the magistrate , i arrest you in the name of the law ! me ! repeated edmond , slightly changing color , and wherefore , i pray ? i can not inform you , but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination . m. morrel felt that further resistance or <UNK> was useless .: 88.22
<S> but to return to our duchess . which the duchess de chevreuse or the duchess de longueville ? have i not already told you that there is nothing between me and the duchess de longueville ?: 41.68
<S> for me !: 31.02
<S> return as soon as you can , florentin .: 66.68
<S> the next morning d artagnan ran to find athos .: 20.97
<S> besides , he wore the uniform of the guards , which , next to that of the musketeers , was most admired by the ladies .: 39.63
<S> it is too late , said mazarin , tearing his hair , too late ! the gale had given way .: 53.59
<S> d artagnan thought it was proper to follow this example .: 24.66
<S> god knows how much i love , <UNK> you . see that you forget nothing , said athos , appearing to look about him , that he might hide his emotion .: 64.06
<S> that happened which m. de tre ville had foreseen .: 37.89
<S> mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach .: 86.04
<S> at the same time , he saw they were about to lower the boat .: 18.42
<S> it lasted nearly three hours ; he then heard a noise of something falling , and all was silent .: 75.57
<S> ah ! said porthos , let us hear what he says . d artagnan opened the letter and read as follows : dear d artagnan , dear du vallon , my good friends , perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me .: 27.12
<S> you are right , your excellency , he said ; this must be one of your friends . then going to albert , he touched him on the shoulder , saying , will your excellency please to awaken ? albert stretched out his arms , rubbed his eyelids , and opened his eyes .: 33.58
<S> no , i slept , as i generally do when i am weary without having the courage to amuse myself , or when i am hungry without feeling inclined to eat . but you can sleep when you please , monsieur ? said morrel .: 60.79
<S> it is he who in an encounter with your eminence s guards decided the victory in favor of the king s musketeers ; it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de wardes , your emissary , and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail ; it is he who , knowing it was i who had madame bonacieux carried off , has sworn my death . ah , ah ! said the cardinal , i know of whom you speak . i mean that miserable d artagnan . he is a bold fellow , said the cardinal .: 53.76
<S> how did your father receive him , albert ?: 42.78
<S> in all probability he has , replied the valet , for i saw the horses harnessed to his eminence s carriage this morning , and when i asked where he was going , they told me , to st. germain . he is beforehand with us , said m. de tre ville .: 31.87
<S> impossible ! the conversation had rested there and scarron , through sheer obstinacy , had seen monsieur de gondy only the more frequently .: 314.13
<S> he was wealthy once , perhaps ? said the inspector .: 104.30
<S> help , cried caderousse ; i am murdered ! we are here ; take courage . ah , it s all over !: 64.61
<S> valentine now requires only the <UNK> of the priest . <UNK> you are mistaken , sir , exclaimed morrel , raising himself on one knee , his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt you are mistaken ; valentine , dying as she has , not only requires a priest , but an avenger .: 138.51
<S> how ? replied d artagnan , you care little if she kills buckingham or causes him to be killed ?: 194.27
<S> i am not a priest . you are not a priest ! cried the executioner .: 13.56
<S> it was an imposing sight to witness this old man , apparently a mere useless burden , becoming the sole protector , support , and adviser of the lovers who were both young , beautiful , and strong .: 191.52
<S> and now that you have all you want , and that we understand each other , jump down from the tilbury and disappear . not at all , my good friend . how ?: 44.27
<S> and if i do not possess that talent , which your smiles prove to me you doubt , should i not still have that ardent love of independence , which will be a substitute for wealth , and which in my mind <UNK> even the instinct of self preservation ?: 146.98
<S> no , but , perhaps , you will permit me to call to mind stay ! the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts .: 42.24
<S> in a moment . you didn t forget my purse ? no ; be easy . good . porthos and mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post .: 76.85
<S> save me , i am pursued ! said andrea , clasping his hands .: 22.96
<S> always the same always the child s corpse , coming every night in my dreams , rising from the earth , and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture .: 187.59
<S> but this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made was perfectly just .: 264.38
<S> saved ! mechanically repeated the young gentleman , releasing the mane and sliding from the saddle into raoul s arms ; raoul was but ten yards from the shore ; there he bore the fainting man , and laying him down upon the grass , unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his doublet .: 126.87
<S> porthos lived in an apartment , large in size and of very sumptuous appearance , in the rue du vieux colombier .: 84.11
<S> nothing , nothing , replied the priest ; go on . it was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand , that his writing might not be recognized , and fernand who put it in the post . but , exclaimed the abbe suddenly , you were there yourself . i ! said caderousse , astonished ; who told you i was there ? the abbe saw he had <UNK> the mark , and he added quickly , no one ; but in order to have known everything so well , you must have been an eye witness . true , true ! said caderousse in a choking voice , i was there . and did you not <UNK> against such infamy ? asked the abbe ; if not , you were an accomplice . sir , replied caderousse , they had made me drink to such an excess that i nearly lost all perception .: 64.13
<S> there is so much fog in that detestable country , at least so d artagnan declares . just as the <UNK> conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded , hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door .: 224.94
<S> he is some spanish or flemish spy , said he , putting his hand to his pistol .: 55.51
<S> it is eleven o clock in the morning and the pious <UNK> have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of king charles i .: 132.11
<S> no , i want to live ; i shall struggle to the very last ; i will yet win back the happiness of which i have been deprived .: 59.26
<S> besides , kitty will tell nothing ; will you , kitty ?: 63.71
<S> in the name of heaven , run , call !: 36.12
<S> the third attack will either carry me off , or leave me paralyzed for life . no , no , cried dante s ; you are mistaken you will not die !: 48.92
<S> the sun , red and flaming , was sinking into the embrace of the <UNK> ocean .: 99.15
<S> and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufort , nor to de bouillon , nor to the coadjutor , nor to d elbeuf .: 130.09
<S> are you fond of traveling ? my life has been passed on the high road . would anything retain you particularly in paris ? nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in paris . very well .: 117.17
<S> that , continued the cardinal , arose not only from a feeling of natural <UNK> , but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to you . d artagnan became more and more astonished .: 76.97
<S> albert rejoined his mother ; she was very pale .: 40.58
<S> there i will indicate to you the best place and time . the two young men bowed and separated , aramis ascending the street which led to the luxembourg , while d artagnan , perceiving the appointed hour was approaching , took the road to the carmes deschaux , saying to himself , decidedly i can t draw back ; but at least , if i am killed , i shall be killed by a musketeer . chapter v. the king s musketeers and the cardinal s guards d artagnan was acquainted with nobody in paris .: 59.57
<S> never , never ! the devil ! said athos .: 19.78
<S> i desire that these horses , with completely new harness , may be at the door with my carriage . bertuccio bowed , and was about to retire ; but when he reached the door , he paused , and then said , at what o clock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready ? at five o clock , replied the count .: 38.26
<S> de winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment , intending to watch the spy ; but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table , he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the room .: 48.19
<S> great , therefore , was the astonishment when at the end of the month , he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality .: 50.13
<S> get up ! he continued his way toward the quai des <UNK> augustins , while the two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate porthos .: 76.79
<S> count , he said , i swear to you my soul is no longer my own . maximilian , you know i have no relation in the world .: 21.80
<S> the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative .: 128.48
<S> at that moment he cut it .: 46.37
<S> m. danglars was disagreeable , certainly , but i know how much you care for his ill humor .: 82.41
<S> porthos , abated , no doubt , of his too great confidence by his adventure of chantilly , played with skill and prudence .: 164.88
<S> do not dig any more , said the voice ; only tell me how high up is your excavation ? on a level with the floor . how is it concealed ? behind my bed . has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner ? no . what does your chamber open on ? a corridor . and the corridor ? on a court . alas ! murmured the voice .: 99.61
<S> of whom do you speak ?: 29.01
<S> at bottom the character of m. bonacieux was one of profound selfishness mixed with <UNK> avarice , the whole <UNK> with extreme cowardice .: 382.34
<S> if the abbe busoni should by any accident return , think of me . in another week you will have left beaucaire , remarked caderousse , for the fair ends in a few days . true , but that makes no difference .: 104.33
<S> tis raoul who has come back , said athos ; and we can now hear how the poor child is . in fact , the young man appeared at the gate , covered with dust , entered the courtyard , leaped from his horse , which he consigned to the charge of a groom , and then went to greet the count and d artagnan .: 35.15
<S> yes ; do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is introducing ? said morcerf .: 30.13
<S> porthos turned to look at his sword , which was hanging on the wall ; aramis seized his knife ; d artagnan arose .: 30.06
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> and when did he set out ? yesterday evening . planchet , my friend , interrupted d artagnan , you are really a precious fellow . you will understand , monsieur , i thought there would be still time , if you wish , to see monsieur de cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet gone .: 40.02
<S> oh , heavens ! exclaimed morrel , i do not deceive myself that young man who is waving his hat , that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant , is albert de morcerf ! yes , said monte cristo , i recognized him . how so ? you were looking the other way . <UNK> the count smiled , as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply , and he again turned towards the veiled woman , who soon disappeared at the corner of the street .: 42.21
<S> captivity : the second day chapter liv .: 58.14
<S> madame danglars did not see them ; she was engaged in <UNK> the beatings of her heart , and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth .: 82.25
<S> this beam crossed , or rather blocked up , the hole dante s had made ; it was necessary , therefore , to dig above or under it .: 153.75
<S> i can recognize the flavor of the <UNK> in which it has been dissolved .: 73.84
<S> you are free to night , without fighting ; so much the better !: 38.02
<S> milady was looking out at the window , and pretended not to hear the door as it opened .: 26.55
<S> he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued , and having reached it , he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone .: 102.81
<S> so much the worse , so much the worse diavolo ! as they say in my country . reverend sir , i am impelled every criminal says the same thing . poverty pshaw ! said busoni disdainfully ; poverty may make a man beg , steal a loaf of bread at a baker s door , but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited .: 164.93
<S> you whose devotion recognizes neither country nor misfortune , you who are sent to me by henrietta ; whatever news you bring , speak out . sire , cromwell has arrived this night at newcastle . ah ! exclaimed the king , to fight ? no , sire , but to buy your majesty . what did you say ? i said , sire , that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the <UNK> army . for <UNK> wages ; yes , i know it .: 116.27
<S> franz fell powerless on a chair ; villefort opened the door and escaped , for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man .: 71.84
<S> he went to desire you to come to the palace .: 43.36
<S> but he bethought him of m. de villefort s promise ; and , besides , death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible .: 65.08
<S> a loan , nothing more !: 117.59
<S> grimaud , said athos , put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk . grimaud shuddered , and nodding , awaited the departure , regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence .: 72.65
<S> you look like four conspirators . oh , as to that , monseigneur , it is true , said athos ; we do conspire , as your eminence might have seen the other morning .: 55.49
<S> it was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final homage .: 133.83
<S> good heavens , madame , said the count , are you ill , or is it the heat of the room that affects you ? are you ill , mother ? cried the viscount , springing towards her .: 35.92
<S> if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement , you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.e.8 .: 17.36
<S> the stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs ; and that the footsteps , which were those of several persons , stopped at the door .: 46.08
<S> it was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear , bordering on the side street , stables and a sort of garden .: 69.15
<S> conclusion .: 151.45
<S> the devil !: 10.10
<S> come , you are no longer twenty years old . to my great regret , mordieu !: 39.46
<S> i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted .: 67.24
<S> the surgeon approached the dying man , who seemed to have fainted .: 28.66
<S> throw myself in the water and strangle him . oh , gentlemen ! cried athos , be men !: 64.93
<S> this battle of folly and flame continued for two hours ; the corso was light as day ; the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible .: 144.32
<S> edmond resigned the lugger to the master s care , and went and lay down in his hammock ; but , in spite of a sleepless night , he could not close his eyes for a moment .: 51.93
<S> during the whole of this nocturnal ride , during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges , guitant and villequier , mazarin was , in truth , studying more especially one man .: 107.20
<S> she had been there some moments , and had heard the last words of the visitor .: 36.33
<S> come , sweep away all that for me !: 123.90
<S> my father is king s attorney , replied andrea calmly .: 46.95
<S> patience , athos !: 37.82
<S> in the antechamber , upon long circular benches , <UNK> the elect ; that is to say , those who were called .: 130.89
<S> my darling !: 55.46
<S> but he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of vengeance .: 107.51
<S> morrel was leaning against one of these , mechanically fixing his eyes on the graves .: 85.25
<S> i shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you . and who is this witness , or rather this enemy ? asked the count , in a tone in which there was a visible alteration .: 42.07
<S> the man made no reply .: 14.01
<S> it is not the king ! exclaimed the cavalier .: 14.69
<S> for three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with ice .: 129.25
<S> mazarin made a grimace , as if he meant to say , but he does not wear the cardinal s cap ; then he added : so , my friend , it s your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape ? that s my idea , my lord ; and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of vincennes , i should refuse it .: 40.61
<S> this is no act of selfishness , but of delicacy .: 84.41
<S> he knows my tastes , my caprices , my wants .: 120.59
<S> and what , he continued , has been done with the poor body ? by order of cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it .: 85.90
<S> on <UNK> <UNK> , coming exclaimed peppino , who from frequenting the house of signor pastrini understood french perfectly in all its <UNK> .: 742.20
<S> rochefort obeyed and retired .: 90.79
<S> the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states .: 25.52
<S> yet the parisian world is so strange , that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune .: 167.25
<S> good day , dear friend ! replied d artagnan .: 13.02
<S> danglars had not intended starting so late , or he would have remained ; he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town .: 82.79
<S> no country can say it saw my birth .: 236.61
<S> the duke of buckingham and his english , masters of the isle of re , continued to besiege , but without success , the citadel st. martin and the fort of la pre e ; and hostilities with la rochelle had commenced , two or three days before , about a fort which the duc d angoule me had caused to be constructed near the city .: 90.86
<S> grimaud and i got behind a tree , and the scotchman having nowhere to hide himself , threw himself on his face in the road .: 68.61
<S> forward ! cried d artagnan , in his <UNK> voice ; we shall laugh over all this in five minutes . and they darted on anew .: 64.21
<S> you know that it was in leaving his house that m. de caderousse was murdered by his friend benedetto .: 54.31
<S> this note was in a different hand from the rest , which showed that it had been added since his confinement .: 53.37
<S> he followed him .: 15.98
<S> it was captain leclere who gave orders for this delay . talking of captain leclere , has not dante s given you a letter from him ? to me ? no was there one ? i believe that , besides the packet , captain leclere confided a letter to his care . of what packet are you speaking , danglars ? why , that which dante s left at porto ferrajo . how do you know he had a packet to leave at porto ferrajo ? danglars turned very red .: 80.62
<S> albert had left the count to speak to his mother , danglars to converse with young cavalcanti ; monte cristo was for an instant alone .: 48.92
<S> i imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower , or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers , and i wept !: 164.60
<S> their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said , in observing the proceeding of the cardinal , and in looking out for all the couriers who arrived .: 97.36
<S> in short , groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception .: 43.78
<S> a man who holds a sword in his hand , and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that sword , and does not fight , is a coward !: 55.25
<S> planchet and fourreau , as pale as death , were trying to give him succor ; but it was plain that all assistance was useless all the features of the dying man were distorted with agony .: 89.64
<S> it was late ; the priest , who had gone to bed , cried out to them to come in .: 44.51
<S> he thought how one day , in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he was now placed , he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his honor .: 49.38
<S> the more he strove against this <UNK> passion the more his senses yielded to its <UNK> , and at length , weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul , he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble <UNK> , and the enchantment of his marvellous dream .: 271.22
<S> yes , yes , yes ! continued the old man .: 8.41
<S> when i wished to retire into a convent , you remember how angry you were with me ? a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid .: 48.70
<S> after giving me the plan of this house , doubtless hoping i should kill the count and he thus become his heir , or that the count would kill me and i should be out of his way , he <UNK> me , and has murdered me . i have also sent for the procureur . he will not come in time ; i feel my life fast <UNK> . wait a moment , said monte cristo .: 67.11
<S> as the carriage stopped at the door , and albert was alighting , a man approached and gave him a letter .: 25.78
<S> i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us .: 72.64
<S> before this room , to which you could ascend by the grand , and go out by the back staircase , the servants passed with curiosity , and bertuccio with terror .: 90.71
<S> after a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket ; he found rita senseless in the arms of cucumetto .: 67.85
<S> what then ? ah , my dear count , said albert .: 12.68
<S> then the demigod vanished ; he remained scarcely a man .: 121.61
<S> there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg electronic works .: 25.38
<S> the four muskets made but one report , but four men fell .: 117.40
<S> these horsemen were our friends , or rather , an avant garde , composed of d artagnan and athos .: 73.99
<S> bonacieux was acquainted with all the <UNK> and windings of this part of the louvre , appropriated for the people of the household .: 99.39
<S> as soon as they arrived at the spot where groslow stood they stopped , as if guessing that he was the man they wanted .: 48.31
<S> i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry . true , said andrea .: 61.78
<S> master broussel is being killed !: 143.12
<S> grimaud , in fact , was not only the <UNK> , but the <UNK> of the party ; and as he was a man full of forethought , these trousers , carefully rolled up in his valise , contained every sort of tool for immediate use .: 87.68
<S> he remembered that all the first part of his life had been <UNK> by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine , and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul .: 92.80
<S> i can be no longer <UNK> , but you must pardon me , my dear count , for confessing to some degree of astonishment . nay , answered monte cristo , with the most gentlemanly air , tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded .: 74.68
<S> d artagnan placed the ring on his finger , and again waited ; it was evident that all was not yet over .: 26.48
<S> do you think it will be long before he comes in ? no , i think not , for he ordered his breakfast at ten o clock . well , i will go and take a turn in the champs e lyse es , and at ten o clock i will return here ; meanwhile , if the count should come in , will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me ? you may depend on my doing so , sir , said baptistin .: 25.86
<S> unfold your plan , my lord , and we will see . take notice that you are shut up captured . you well know , my lord , that there always remains to us a last resource . what ? that of dying together . mazarin shuddered .: 92.19
<S> yes , the sheep are fed in my meadows , which are excellent <UNK> . give me another cutlet . no , try this hare , which i had killed yesterday in one of my <UNK> . zounds !: 154.08
<S> there was no longer any doubt , the bankrupt was in the hands of roman banditti .: 38.62
<S> do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal can not reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand ?: 72.98
<S> indeed , i think provincial air will suit us much better just now than the air of paris .: 178.88
<S> we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead , and because a remembrance is less <UNK> than a living creature , though a remembrance is sometimes devouring . but , said milady , in a hollow , faint voice , what brings you back to me , and what do you want with me ? i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes , i have not lost sight of you . you know what i have done ? i can relate to you , day by day , your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening . a smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of milady .: 54.60
<S> but d artagnan was too far off to hear him ; and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed , he certainly would not have remarked it .: 58.62
<S> it must have been charming , indeed .: 28.93
<S> i had prepared it beforehand , for i am much in want of money today . and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand , while with the other he held out the receipt to danglars .: 42.64
<S> men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by god s .: 95.08
<S> the first moments of her captivity were terrible ; a few convulsions of rage which she could not <UNK> paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature .: 318.97
<S> he was not deceived ; it was she whom he sought .: 32.31
<S> the shade of richelieu was mazarin .: 50.22
<S> but how shall i address the minister ? sit down there , said villefort , giving up his place to morrel , and write what i dictate . will you be so good ? certainly .: 52.49
<S> a month of fever could not have changed her more than this one night of sleeplessness and sorrow .: 185.28
<S> i know not whom ; look and judge for yourself . thank you , i understand .: 55.24
<S> yes , this self , of whom i thought so much , of whom i was so proud , who had appeared so <UNK> in the dungeons of the cha teau d if , and whom i had succeeded in making so great , will be but a <UNK> of <UNK> tomorrow .: 66.75
<S> hallo , fernand !: 110.66
<S> no , said felton , it is nothing . but what , then , is the noise ? that of the patrol going their rounds . where is their road ? just under us . they will discover us ! no , if it does not <UNK> . but they will run against the bottom of the ladder . fortunately it is too short by six feet . here they are !: 62.20
<S> it would be , no doubt , parbleu , if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast importance , of the horrors of the cardinal speak lower ! said athos .: 110.30
<S> excuse my little subterfuge , said the countess , in reply to her companion s half reproachful observation on the subject ; but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable , and i longed to be alone , that i might compose my startled mind . franz essayed to smile .: 156.15
<S> ah , valentine , tell me , if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles ?: 37.38
<S> and now , said la ramee , i must ask your highness s pardon , but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure . the duke tried to exchange a glance with grimaud , but there was no glance in grimaud s eyes .: 35.94
<S> tell us about it , said athos , palpitating .: 29.27
<S> it is a woman s voice , cried aramis ; faith , i would give a good deal if she is young and pretty . and he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of her .: 43.40
<S> yes , said morrel , it is true ; i have but now left a house where death has just entered , to run to you . are you then come from m. de morcerf s ? asked monte cristo .: 27.40
<S> for you hear that , instead of becoming calmer , the noise increases . madame , said d artagnan , the people want to see the king and they must see him . what !: 58.41
<S> i made a sign to grimaud and the scotchman , and we all three retired into a corner of the square .: 47.06
<S> the duke ! porthos and d artagnan roared out both at once .: 56.50
<S> but don t let us hinder you , mousqueton ; go and perform your master s orders .: 50.75
<S> an order to conduct you to a room , and to leave you there to talk to me . oh , cried andrea , leaping with joy .: 43.64
<S> you see , then , felton , i can do nothing but die .: 23.97
<S> adieu , and a prosperous voyage .: 190.21
<S> athos was a gentleman , punctilious in points of honor ; and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady , he was sure , certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan .: 160.59
<S> it was nearly eight o clock when they set out again .: 17.23
<S> ah , sir , the poor fellow told you the truth . and for that reason , he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate , and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it . and here the look of the abbe , becoming more and more fixed , seemed to rest with ill concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse .: 104.16
<S> what are you going to do ? cried mme .: 7.89
<S> i am in his majesty s guards , monseigneur , and i have no reason to be dissatisfied . but it appears to me that my guards mine are also his majesty s guards ; and whoever serves in a french corps serves the king . monseigneur , your eminence has ill understood my words . you want a pretext , do you not ?: 81.06
<S> he dressed entirely in black , with the exception of his white tie , and his funeral appearance was only <UNK> by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button hole , and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush .: 167.25
<S> indemnity you agree to indemnify and hold the foundation , the trademark owner , any agent or employee of the foundation , anyone providing copies of project gutenberg electronic works in accordance with this agreement , and any volunteers associated with the production , promotion and distribution of project gutenberg electronic works , harmless from all liability , costs and expenses , including legal fees , that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur : a distribution of this or any project gutenberg work , b alteration , modification , or additions or deletions to any project gutenberg work , and c any defect you cause .: 24.40
<S> at the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop .: 14.32
<S> the first words exchanged between the four friends , on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration , were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness .: 98.86
<S> and , with his lackey , he took the road to the governor s country house .: 31.39
<S> if he comes out we shall catch him .: 43.67
<S> it was true , and raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning ; he gave his horse its head , struck his spurs into its sides , and the animal , urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him , bounded over a kind of <UNK> which inclosed the landing place , and fell into the river , scattering to a distance waves of white froth .: 108.85
<S> speak , said the duke .: 9.91
<S> additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work .: 33.49
<S> and then he a <UNK> on the earth , a man without fortune , a man without family , a soldier accustomed to inns , cabarets , <UNK> , and <UNK> , a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treats was about to partake of family meals , to enjoy the pleasures of a comfortable establishment , and to give himself up to those little attentions which the harder one is , the more they please , as old soldiers say .: 229.59
<S> but will that not excite suspicion , sir ? asked the queen .: 51.63
<S> it was seven o clock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed place .: 18.58
<S> yes , monsieur officer , stammered the mercer , more dead than alive , at your service . come in , said the officer .: 38.17
<S> well , i went to a horse dealer s , where i saw this magnificent horse , which i have named me de ah .: 64.04
<S> the comte de wardes was announced , and d artagnan was introduced .: 16.51
<S> in truth , madame , do you think that can be possible ? indeed , sir , said milady , you must be either drunk or mad .: 28.16
<S> nothing broken ? asked de guiche .: 83.33
<S> the old patron , who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of piedmont and france , between nice and fre <UNK> , urged dante s to try and rise .: 85.14
<S> no , said athos ; monsieur aramis does me the honor to share my opinions . could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend ?: 97.35
<S> she held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion .: 32.65
<S> monsieur d artagnan !: 6.34
<S> but d artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious .: 24.86
<S> the cardinal drew near to the king , and placed in his hand a small casket .: 18.54
<S> this was groslow .: 58.42
<S> but you , madame , so beautiful in reality , you , so pure in appearance , must have committed great iniquities for lord de winter to pursue you thus . they have eyes , repeated milady , with an accent of indescribable grief , but they see not ; ears have they , but they hear not . but , cried the young officer , speak , then , speak ! confide my shame to you , cried milady , with the blush of modesty upon her countenance , for often the crime of one becomes the shame of another confide my shame to you , a man , and i a woman ?: 114.40
<S> must we , then , asked anne of austria , yield to the storm , buy peace , and patiently and <UNK> await better times ? mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech , which showed that she had taken the minister s proposal seriously .: 178.51
<S> he might perhaps have been bought for less ; but while d artagnan was discussing the price with the dealer , athos was counting out the money on the table .: 84.51
<S> it is very soon to leave me , he thought , but he follows the common custom .: 67.04
<S> wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished ? then only she pretended to hear the sound of felton s steps , and rising quick as thought , she blushed , as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees .: 117.30
<S> he rose again to the surface , struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man , uttered a third cry , and felt himself sinking , as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet .: 125.36
<S> this hole communicated with a kind of loft the space between the floor of the king s room and the ceiling of the one below it .: 90.44
<S> my father , the comte de morcerf , although of spanish origin , possesses considerable influence , both at the court of france and madrid , and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself , and all to whom my life is dear , at your disposal . monsieur de morcerf , replied the count , your offer , far from surprising me , is precisely what i expected from you , and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made ; nay , i will go still further , and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands . oh , pray name it . i am wholly a stranger to paris it is a city i have never yet seen . is it possible , exclaimed albert , that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world ?: 74.06
<S> at the end of a quarter of an hour vampa quitted the grotto ; his costume was no less elegant than that of teresa .: 25.59
<S> at auteuil , near paris . m. de villefort a second time raised his head , looked at benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of medusa , and became livid .: 44.25
<S> m. de villefort entered , followed by barrois .: 16.66
<S> count , added merce de s with a supplicating glance , there is a beautiful arabian custom , which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof . i know it , madame , replied the count ; but we are in france , and not in arabia , and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another . but , said the countess , breathlessly , with her eyes fixed on monte cristo , whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands , we are friends , are we not ? the count became pale as death , the blood rushed to his heart , and then again rising , dyed his cheeks with crimson ; his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled .: 71.43
<S> yes . franz took them from barrois and casting a glance at the cover , read : to be given , after my death , to general <UNK> , who shall bequeath the packet to his son , with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important document . well , sir , asked franz , what do you wish me to do with this paper ? to preserve it , sealed up as it is , doubtless , said the procureur .: 76.67
<S> porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting , given by a lady to a cavalier , or by a cavalier to a lady , which had been disturbed by the presence of d artagnan and his yellow horse .: 54.39
<S> why for him and not for me ?: 48.51
<S> the two assistants had borne andrea to the scaffold , and there , in spite of his struggles , his bites , and his cries , had forced him to his knees .: 68.34
<S> how , sir ! she cried , as d artagnan finished , you dare to tell me the details of your crime to give me an account of your treason ! pardon , madame , but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me .: 72.74
<S> the third attack now that this treasure , which had so long been the object of the abbe s meditations , could insure the future happiness of him whom faria really loved as a son , it had doubled its value in his eyes , and every day he expatiated on the amount , explaining to dante s all the good which , with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs , a man could do in these days to his friends ; and then dante s countenance became gloomy , for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory , and he reflected how much ill , in these times , a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies .: 111.32
<S> he made fruitless efforts to go on ; it was impossible .: 74.19
<S> s blood ; does that astonish you ? and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method .: 173.45
<S> i can do much for you , my friend , replied the count .: 11.80
<S> de monte cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our family . if such be the case , my dear valentine , you must yourself have felt , or at all events will soon feel , the effects of his presence .: 92.65
<S> from what he has told me , i know you now .: 19.10
<S> but , continued d artagnan , you shall judge of him for yourself .: 19.82
<S> the ho tel de la tre mouille ! at these cries , all who were in the ho tel rushed out and fell upon the four companions , who on their side cried aloud , to the rescue , musketeers ! this cry was generally heeded ; for the musketeers were known to be enemies of the cardinal , and were beloved on account of the hatred they bore to his eminence .: 65.98
<S> but in fifteen days , as you know , or as you do not know , this fatal campaign is to open .: 50.97
<S> the captain glanced at him , but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure , that suspicions , if the captain had any , died away .: 95.70
<S> and will you sign the contract ? i see no objection to that ; my scruples do not go thus far . well , since you will grant me no more , i must be content with what you give me .: 47.27
<S> a movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers , and pointing to the bench where his enemies were : fire on that bench ! he cried .: 121.19
<S> athos saw the movement ; he made a step toward the muskets , upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes , like men ill disposed to allow themselves to be taken .: 54.47
<S> that woman that woman ! which ? the one with a white dress and so many diamonds the fair one . madame danglars ? i do not know her name ; but it is she , sir , it is she ! whom do you mean ? the woman of the garden ! she that was enceinte she who was walking while she waited for bertuccio stood at the open door , with his eyes starting and his hair on end .: 79.72
<S> it was a long time before i was able to make out what place i was in , or to take account of the details i describe .: 38.87
<S> this costs us nothing , and <UNK> the life , or at least the liberty , of a fellow creature , who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption . ah ! said franz , then you are a smuggler occasionally , gaetano ? your excellency , we must live somehow , returned the other , smiling <UNK> .: 190.05
<S> milady had him one day turned out of doors , with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions .: 224.21
<S> be easy , my dear boy ; they will come in due season ; it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them . morcerf then , with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or well lined pocketbook , supped , went to bed , slept soundly , and dreamed he was <UNK> all over rome at carnival time in a coach with six horses .: 240.55
<S> at the same instant the firing began on the other side , and the balls penetrated the boards all round us .: 69.75
<S> laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and monsieur du vallon , instead of being in the depths of despair about it . but d artagnan was still in a desponding mood .: 88.08
<S> what are the wishes of his eminence ? he wishes to have you in his service . and who spoke to him of me ? rochefort you remember him ? yes , pardieu !: 44.30
<S> it is for me , then , to interrogate grimaud . where is she ? asked athos .: 18.06
<S> athos sighed deeply .: 31.87
<S> tell me , now , can you deny all this ? and who told you this fine story , sire ? asked tre ville , quietly .: 35.29
<S> splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt , and lace fell also over the top of his boots .: 258.48
<S> ah , that would indeed be infamous . how did danglars usually write ? in a handsome , running hand . and how was the anonymous letter written ? <UNK> . again the abbe smiled .: 248.15
<S> but if i were wrong i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday ; i have been thinking of your firmness all night , and i said to myself that justice must be on your side , or man s countenance is no longer to be relied on . but , morrel , albert is your friend ? simply an acquaintance , sir . you met on the same day you first saw me ? yes , that is true ; but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me . thank you , morrel . then ringing the bell once , look . said he to ali , who came immediately , take that to my <UNK> .: 81.18
<S> debray , perhaps , as it was once proposed .: 53.43
<S> it is already done , he said ; brucine is no longer employed , but a simple narcotic !: 72.63
<S> he was pale , but calm and collected , and saluting his judge with easy politeness , looked round for a seat , as if he had been in m. morrel s salon .: 53.27
<S> now , then , she said , what next ? madame , my friend du vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in the way of fortune to desire ; but i think i remember that there was a question between him and monsieur mazarin as to making his estate a barony .: 49.75
<S> where is he ? there , in the salon .: 32.02
<S> aha ! continued d artagnan , it is clear that they are afraid of something or other ; for look , the sentinels are being reinforced .: 61.51
<S> d artagnan , with a sudden <UNK> of wrath , seized the lad by the ear and led him apart , with the injunction : stay you where you are and don t you stir , or i will pull this ear off .: 132.68
<S> my dear grimaud , thou <UNK> seldom , but when thou dost , one must do thee justice thy words are words of gold . chapter xx .: 358.64
<S> hayde e had three french <UNK> , and one who was a greek .: 134.05
<S> d artagnan desired planchet to be summoned , but he had disappeared .: 27.67
<S> one individual went from door to door , bending under the weight of swords , guns , muskets and every kind of weapon , which he deposited as fast as he could .: 124.24
<S> he told me that he should henceforth recruit his musketeers from among the guards of monsieur the cardinal . the guards of the cardinal !: 47.79
<S> well , sir , the rupture of a blood vessel on the <UNK> of the brain has destroyed all this , not in a day , not in an hour , but in a second .: 74.08
<S> you will not swear , my master , said the concierge , shaking his head .: 13.86
<S> i am planchet planchet , whom you know well . but the honest servant could say no more , so much was he overcome by this unexpected interview .: 88.14
<S> it is raoul who has worked in me the change you see ; i was dried up like a miserable tree , isolated , attached to nothing on earth ; it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life .: 145.60
<S> many young men of palestrina , frascati , and pampinara had disappeared .: 115.50
<S> an officer who saw me , with a jealous eye , reading the lives of the saints to the mistress of the house , entered suddenly and without being announced .: 66.07
<S> whilst d artagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint germain , athos and aramis returned to paris .: 22.86
<S> could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality , and not coiners say ? yes , monsieur , you are right , said the host .: 49.55
<S> that is no impediment , sir , said she ; i have had greater men than you arrested guitant ! mazarin sprang forward .: 91.71
<S> the rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace .: 104.33
<S> lord de winter tore his hair .: 26.73
<S> go , go , i implore you , and return hereafter !: 52.63
<S> the host remained standing in front of him , looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face , <UNK> both gravity and sweetness of expression .: 107.91
<S> liked a pleasant jest .: 419.60
<S> if they continue to advance , we must fire again .: 47.22
<S> poor madame du vallon !: 49.17
<S> i am not one of those tyrants who detain women by force .: 98.20
<S> when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore , the man on the beach , who carried a carbine , presented arms after the manner of a sentinel , and cried , who comes there ? in sardinian .: 82.58
<S> and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles ? my first sentiment was horror , the second indifference , the third curiosity . curiosity that is a terrible word . why so ?: 255.63
<S> put him to death ! franz sprang back , but the count seized his arm , and held him before the window .: 35.64
<S> defend yourself . one minute , said the young man .: 28.10
<S> you may see matters differently , d artagnan , and think otherwise .: 88.82
<S> do you know of what he died ! asked d avrigny , placing his hand on noirtier s shoulder .: 18.17
<S> on the contrary , when one <UNK> a blow that is the <UNK> way to strike .: 120.18
<S> he was now , as we have said , three and thirty years of age , and his fourteen years imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance .: 27.40
<S> but how ? asked mazarin .: 13.75
<S> 21 in molie re s comedy , le <UNK> .: 1652.83
<S> the cry proceeded from the grotto .: 45.84
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> it was evident that the abbe limited himself to objects of strict necessity .: 128.17
<S> i will not have you left alone so long .: 34.96
<S> from this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer , but to have everything he wanted .: 69.87
<S> monsieur baptistin , said the count , you have been in my service one year , the time i generally give myself to judge of the merits or <UNK> of those about me .: 72.65
<S> the dim light , the profound silence , and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour , and still more by her own conscience , all combined to produce a sensation of fear ; the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work .: 109.32
<S> i have no hope of penetrating , sword in hand , to paris , i know that well .: 51.98
<S> then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden <UNK> ; he arose , rushed out of the room and to the stairs , exclaiming energetically , julie , julie emmanuel , emmanuel ! monte cristo endeavored also to leave , but maximilian would have died rather than <UNK> his hold of the handle of the door , which he closed upon the count .: 127.15
<S> we can now part ; come , i shall engage your passage . and you , my dear boy ? i shall stay here for a few days longer ; we must accustom ourselves to parting .: 80.04
<S> go , then , said the duke , and return as soon as possible . does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday ? grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent .: 76.35
<S> once under my grandfather s roof , m. morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector , if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness ; in that case i shall expect m. morrel to come and claim me at my own hands .: 107.23
<S> richelieu in fact , said aramis , it is an absolution according to rule . that paper must be torn to pieces , said d artagnan , who fancied he read in it his sentence of death .: 68.25
<S> the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it , whilst d artagnan stood imperturbable , without showing either impatience or curiosity .: 145.09
<S> halloo ! cried jussac , advancing toward them and making a sign to his men to do so likewise , halloo , musketeers ?: 70.81
<S> all at once , at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers ; she counted two , then five , then eight horsemen .: 122.93
<S> haven t you some one who will relieve me of my horse ? groslow whistled and a sailor appeared .: 144.37
<S> and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself ? i should , my dear d artagnan , have been so , but nature said no . when i am in the <UNK> , if by chance a pretty woman looks at me , i look at her again : if she smiles , i smile too .: 76.86
<S> monsieur the abbe , said he , do you like blows with a cane ? i can not say , monsieur , answered i ; no one has ever dared to give me any . well , listen to me , then , monsieur the abbe !: 28.00
<S> halloo !: 28.51
<S> all i ask is , that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles .: 104.79
<S> you didn t know king charles ; to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him . so saying , he stretched out his hand , but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side .: 68.46
<S> during the exchange of these two words felton drew back quickly , and when lord de winter entered , he was several paces from the prisoner .: 47.75
<S> danglars was tired and sleepy ; he therefore went to bed , placing his pocketbook under his pillow .: 76.24
<S> i then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning , and here i am .: 50.45
<S> it had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the <UNK> commander ; he dismounted and entered .: 123.28
<S> but scarcely had the two rapiers clashed , when a company of the guards of his eminence , commanded by m. de jussac , turned the corner of the convent .: 81.62
<S> meanwhile , the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king s room , attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men , had stolen little by little toward the table , and standing on tiptoe , <UNK> , watching the game , over the shoulders of d artagnan and porthos .: 115.62
<S> she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger , and maximilian began to laugh .: 14.90
<S> she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan <UNK> , a red and black bodice , and golden pins in her hair .: 118.62
<S> hurry ! the horses bounded beneath the whip ; and in five minutes they stopped before the count s door .: 58.27
<S> these two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions , and formed into pills .: 302.59
<S> indeed , the name of bernajoux was known to all the world , d artagnan alone <UNK> , perhaps ; for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not repress .: 98.64
<S> listen , said morrel ; it is not the first time you have contemplated our present position , which is a serious and urgent one ; i do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow ; leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret .: 76.04
<S> they were yours , you disposed of them according to your fancy , and i asked no questions ; but it is not the less true that you have this year received 500,000 livres . well , sir , and what then ? ah , yes , it was just after this that you spoiled everything . really , your manner of speaking it expresses my meaning , and that is all i want .: 72.19
<S> well , here i am ; be satisfied .: 19.56
<S> it was three o clock ; at a quarter past , a merchant presented himself to insure two ships ; it was a clear profit of 15,000 francs .: 79.97
<S> it is a veritable army ! my faith , yes , said athos ; there they are .: 42.67
<S> do you know in what crime you are to day engaged ?: 63.19
<S> he could not distinguish her countenance , but a sinister smile passed over the lips of athos .: 25.24
<S> i love you as one loves a father , brother , husband !: 61.79
<S> the fact is , one can not remain thus , with a sword hanging eternally over his head , said athos .: 71.07
<S> see the fatal example : on the vendomois road , d artagnan , you so brave , and you , porthos , so valiant and so strong you were beaten ; to day aramis and i are beaten in our turn .: 121.55
<S> buckingham remained for a moment dazzled .: 101.17
<S> he wished to lodge the two travelers each in a charming chamber ; but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the opposite extremities of the ho tel .: 86.49
<S> without remorse , said he .: 32.02
<S> this insolent boy <UNK> others , cried he ; and i hope that this time he whom he ought to <UNK> will not escape him as before . will not escape him ? replied the stranger , knitting his brow .: 97.64
<S> after mass the young monarch drove to the parliament house , where , upon the throne , he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed , but issued new ones , each one , according to cardinal de retz , more <UNK> than the others a proceeding which drew forth a strong <UNK> from the chief president , mole whilst president blancmesnil and councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes .: 430.74
<S> but , suggested d artagnan , have we not our friend mousqueton , who managed for us so well at chantilly , porthos ? yes , said porthos , we have mousqueton , but since he has been steward , he has become very heavy ; never mind , let us call him , and to make sure that he will reply agreeably here !: 63.41
<S> the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city , which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil , had awakened to such feverish commotion ; nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them , declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears .: 113.47
<S> the youth s dark hair was <UNK> parted and hung in curls , forming a sort of dark frame around his face ; such was the fashion of the day .: 158.52
<S> towards the close of the first act , the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened ; a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris , where indeed , he had imagined she still was .: 89.56
<S> i was going to ask you if you had received any news of monsieur franz . yes , yesterday . what did he tell you ? that he was leaving at the same time as his letter . well , now then , the count ? the count will come , of that you may be satisfied . you know that he has another name besides monte cristo ? no , i did not know it . monte cristo is the name of an island , and he has a family name . i never heard it . well , then , i am better informed than you ; his name is zaccone . it is possible . he is a maltese . that is also possible .: 35.15
<S> the face of the steward , despite one slight shade of care , light as a summer cloud , seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity .: 233.72
<S> he was then informed of the contents of the letter from the island of elba , in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party .: 27.74
<S> raoul at the same time seized one of the young man s hands and placed it on the mane , which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man .: 36.19
<S> i should myself have recommended the match , had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it . is it possible the king could have <UNK> so far as to express himself so favorably of me ? asked the enraptured villefort .: 152.65
<S> cocles went first , and the stranger followed him .: 22.73
<S> this event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal ; and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of la rochelle , which was determined , he had sent monsieur to direct the first operations , and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the <UNK> of war .: 90.37
<S> grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man , for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastion something he had till then doubted he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat .: 105.46
<S> my story will be accepted , for there is no one left to contradict me . as he spoke , dante s looked toward the spot where the fishing vessel had been <UNK> , and started .: 67.26
<S> tell me what it says . count , will you allow me to send baptistin to inquire after someone you know ? i am at your service , and still more my servants . oh , i can not live if she is not better . shall i ring for baptistin ? no , i will go and speak to him myself . morrel went out , called baptistin , and whispered a few words to him .: 46.42
<S> he was very much inclined to do so , the contemptible fellow .: 36.03
<S> de cha teau renaud m .: 36.56
<S> have i by any means displeased you ?: 87.36
<S> go to the assistance of madame de villefort , he said to the nurse .: 19.13
<S> save me !: 26.39
<S> confide in me .: 352.28
<S> madame , said he .: 9.67
<S> each of you take a horse by the bridle , he said to porthos and mousqueton ; turn to the left , so that athos and aramis may see you clearly from the window . they are coming , then ? said porthos .: 47.04
<S> and what has procured me so flattering a distinction ? what ?: 84.29
<S> fortunately , deceived by d artagnan s trick , they neglected to reload their guns .: 123.84
<S> remember at a later period and at a certain moment , if any mischance should happen to you , said richelieu , significantly , that it was i who came to seek you , and that i did all in my power to prevent this misfortune <UNK> you . i shall entertain , whatever may happen , said d artagnan , placing his hand upon his breast and bowing , an eternal gratitude toward your eminence for that which you now do for me . well , let it be , then , as you have said , monsieur d artagnan ; we shall see each other again after the campaign .: 47.77
<S> the unknown waited for silence , and then resumed , i told you well that she would know me .: 53.71
<S> however , the vessel and the swimmer insensibly <UNK> one another , and in one of its <UNK> the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him .: 157.21
<S> yes , albert , from whatever source the blow may have proceeded it may be from an enemy , but that enemy is only the agent of providence . albert held his head between his hands ; he raised his face , red with shame and bathed in tears , and seizing beauchamp s arm : my friend , said he , my life is ended .: 80.48
<S> the motive given for all the taxes <UNK> imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition , was the necessity of sustaining the honor of france and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy .: 204.92
<S> judge for yourself , replied he .: 49.60
<S> i did not expect to see you again , said he feebly , to dante s .: 28.14
<S> you particularly wish it ? asked he .: 71.14
<S> he was dressed in violet tinted velvet , trimmed with silk of the same color .: 163.73
<S> valentine and morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of noirtier when a ring was heard at the door bell .: 87.99
<S> well , then , with well acted good humor , i allow grimaud , but no one else ; you must manage it all .: 80.91
<S> to whom was this letter addressed ? to m. noirtier , rue coq he ron , no .: 54.91
<S> an hour had elapsed since her condemnation ; at that moment , doubtless , she was recalling all her crimes to her memory ; she was asking pardon for her sins ; perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous husband a forgiveness she was purchasing with her death !: 241.94
<S> but hast thou nothing to say to thy friend planchet ? how , my friend planchet ?: 151.20
<S> the notary left the room backwards , and bowing down to the ground ; it was the first time he had ever met a similar client .: 42.30
<S> you believe me to be a frenchman , for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself .: 58.45
<S> now , leave me , and desire my valet de chambre to come hither . scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber .: 63.02
<S> villefort was no longer the civilized man ; he was a tiger hurt unto death , gnashing his teeth in his wound .: 160.24
<S> not so foolish as all that . ah ! muttered athos , i may be mistaken , i haven t the unerring eye of d artagnan . who is speaking of monsieur d artagnan ? asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room .: 39.87
<S> they reached saint german without any accident ; on descending , the queen found the prince awaiting her , bare headed , to offer her his hand .: 144.01
<S> oh , he is the exact <UNK> of what i have been led to expect !: 82.87
<S> locusta valentine was alone ; two other clocks , slower than that of saint <UNK> du roule , struck the hour of midnight from different directions , and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was silent .: 338.39
<S> poor fellow !: 31.61
<S> with this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of d artagnan .: 57.53
<S> oh , said he , is it you , captain ?: 13.17
<S> it will take quite six weeks to <UNK> the cargo , and we can not get you ready for sea until three months after that ; only be back again in three months , for the pharaon , added the owner , <UNK> the young sailor on the back , can not sail without her captain . without her captain ! cried dante s , his eyes sparkling with animation ; pray mind what you say , for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart .: 103.32
<S> such as were only beautiful gave their beauty , whence , without doubt , comes the proverb , the most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has . such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money ; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be <UNK> who would neither have won their spurs in the first place , nor their battles afterward , without the purse , more or less furnished , which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow .: 257.48
<S> indeed , almost before the door opened , the scene changed .: 55.93
<S> he was on villefort s premises had arrived there by <UNK> the wall .: 203.60
<S> but if i am to believe you , sir , the people seem to have thrown off all restraint . it is a bad year for kings , said gondy , shaking his head ; look at england , madame . yes ; but fortunately we have no oliver cromwell in france , replied the queen .: 53.12
<S> not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere .: 256.33
<S> deuce take it !: 74.28
<S> monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once , the one violently , the other secretly .: 217.06
<S> you talk of sacrilege !: 81.31
<S> what are you doing here ? asked the count , seeing him covered with dust ; i did not send for you , i think ? baptistin , without answering , approached the count , and presented the letter .: 26.82
<S> be assured that i am devoted to both these all powerful masters , and that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the king , and also the cardinal one of the most illustrious geniuses that france has ever produced .: 104.22
<S> the cardinal s , replied mme .: 20.55
<S> on the contrary , there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory . yes , yes , said porthos , trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone .: 39.10
<S> meanwhile , morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase , which , being carpeted , prevented his approach being heard , and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of m. de villefort even would not have alarmed him .: 68.25
<S> i know you are not rich , madame coquenard , and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a few paltry crowns from them .: 95.58
<S> this letter was read publicly in all parts of the city .: 71.03
<S> sire , stammered the baron .: 39.07
<S> and you , said athos , you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing lord de winter s name .: 44.69
<S> oh , do not fear the scaffold , madame , said the magistrate ; i will not dishonor you , since that would be dishonor to myself ; no , if you have heard me distinctly , you will understand that you are not to die on the scaffold . no , i do not understand ; what do you mean ? stammered the unhappy woman , completely overwhelmed .: 33.73
<S> i begin , and without any <UNK> . allow me , porthos , said aramis .: 47.02
<S> assunta took care of all , and our little fortune increased .: 147.56
<S> indeed ! thought porthos , casting a glance at the three hungry clerks for the errand boy , as might be expected , was not admitted to the honors of the magisterial table , in my cousin s place , i would not keep such <UNK> !: 140.64
<S> d avrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every morning .: 56.46
<S> five minutes later he came down the grand staircase . you followed him ? cried athos .: 46.85
<S> i must know what you mean to do ! said she .: 18.55
<S> the universal response was , that the fare was detestable , and that they wanted to be set free .: 103.69
<S> you say truly , the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars ; besides , what would it be to them ?: 87.99
<S> yes , and i would rather face your majesty , however threatening your smile , than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from i know not whence , unless from deepest hell . bravo , said d artagnan in a whisper to porthos ; well answered . well , said the queen , biting her lips , whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise , what is the desire of my people ? that broussel shall be given up to them , madame . never ! said the queen , never ! your majesty is mistress , said la meilleraie , retreating a few steps .: 103.77
<S> dear , excellent friend , murmured albert , still burning the papers .: 123.75
<S> at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock .: 39.46
<S> then you must suffer hunger . suffer hunger ? said danglars , becoming pale .: 109.77
<S> a regiment of cuirassiers , nearly equal as to numbers , issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it .: 252.38
<S> do you think his uncle de winter would have brought up that young viper ?: 81.58
<S> albert went to his room , and dressed with unusual care .: 35.55
<S> that s against all rules .: 239.51
<S> he will speak to me of god and death , as he has spoken to many another dying man , not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper , his children to the cold contempt of public charity . and he raised the medallion to his lips .: 127.05
<S> the dead are everywhere , said morrel ; did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris ? maximilian , said the count , you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at marseilles .: 49.79
<S> come , come , continued d arminges , to dinner ; for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a repast .: 166.97
<S> one morning albert was awakened by his valet de chambre , who announced beauchamp .: 50.67
<S> the queen had just regained her chamber , and d artagnan was about to retire , when he felt his shoulder lightly touched .: 40.45
<S> the commission might well be called delicate ; and the king had reached , in his jealousy of buckingham , the point of not being jealous of anyone else .: 102.74
<S> athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy ; he looked long on this young man , whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes <UNK> soft dreams and lightest slumber , as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection .: 238.42
<S> after a moment s silence , the lady inquired : do you know , my dear count , she said , that you are a very terrible <UNK> , and that you look at the world through a somewhat <UNK> medium ?: 51.26
<S> in returning with the comte de la fere and monsieur d herblay our crime would be confirmed .: 48.24
<S> yes . noirtier raised his eyes , it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything .: 63.24
<S> their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages .: 432.27
<S> the duchess de longueville has invited me to pass a few days in normandy , and has deputed me , while her son is being <UNK> , to go and prepare her residence at rouen ; after which , if nothing new occurs , i shall go and bury myself in my convent at noisy le sec . and i , said athos , am returning to bragelonne .: 109.78
<S> two feet below you ; take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the floor .: 139.25
<S> if i thought the fellow knew me by my name i would be <UNK> , for fear it might be thought i knew him . he knows you better by your actions than your name ; he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of monsieur de beaufort , and he has <UNK> an active search for them , i can answer for it . by whom ? by me ; and this morning he sent for me to ask me if i had obtained any information . and what did you reply ? that i had none as yet ; but that i was to dine to day with two gentlemen , who would be able to give me some . you told him that ? said porthos , a broad smile spreading over his honest face .: 58.78
<S> the favorite of two kings , immensely rich , all powerful in a kingdom which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice , george villiers , duke of buckingham , had lived one of those fabulous existences which survive , in the course of centuries , to astonish posterity .: 233.93
<S> but whoever you may be , i charge you not to advance another step . long live the emperor ! said the figure .: 98.48
<S> the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit , as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos , who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air , and saluted him courteously .: 62.10
<S> but you are unable to oppose them , you , whose mind is so quick , and whose will is so firm are nevertheless , as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself .: 135.59
<S> franz and albert had brought to rome letters of introduction to them , and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the <UNK> of his travelling companion .: 86.78
<S> the servant soon returned .: 43.16
<S> the name was not wholly forgotten , but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections .: 127.80
<S> it is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it .: 32.33
<S> i thought so , madame , stammered the young girl .: 14.54
<S> now , retire to your chambers , said athos , and leave me to act .: 44.73
<S> i have never understood how i could have laid low a head so beautiful , with a face so pale . the monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion ; he trembled all over ; he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask .: 120.11
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> your mother , albert , knows that poor house well .: 154.68
<S> i had often heard him complain of the <UNK> of his rank with his fortune ; and i advised him to invest all he had in an annuity .: 71.67
<S> since your eminence has come so far , come a few steps further ; conduct us , my lord , to the wall . be it so , replied the cardinal ; and walking in a straight line he went to the wall , at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same instant .: 44.64
<S> each was accompanied by two priests .: 72.50
<S> i only know for a certainty that he fell ; and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions . the devil , gentlemen ! said the cardinal , three men placed hors de combat in a cabaret <UNK> !: 73.73
<S> you will not ?: 26.98
<S> one moment longer and all would disappear .: 246.30
<S> not at all ! said d artagnan .: 11.06
<S> the sum was collected in a minute .: 50.29
<S> at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty , and hastening his steps , as if to reach the other side of the port , scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking .: 47.34
<S> he sank into his seat , and hastily turning over the packet , drew forth the fatal letter , at which he glanced with an expression of terror .: 45.22
<S> in order to go from the door to the house , or from the house to the door , m. de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees .: 25.01
<S> why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from mazarin ?: 120.59
<S> they all rushed towards him , for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority ; yet jacopo reached him first .: 195.33
<S> he could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction ; but this smile soon disappeared , and returning to the adventure of meung , tell me , continued he , had not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek ? yes , such a one as would be made by the <UNK> of a ball . was he not a fine looking man ? yes . of lofty stature . yes . of pale complexion and brown hair ? yes , yes , that is he ; how is it , sir , that you are acquainted with this man ?: 67.30
<S> we are all mortal , my poor friends . you are late , my dear porthos . yes , there were some people on the way who delayed me .: 49.42
<S> at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door , and she perceived felton , who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her .: 51.94
<S> ah , ah ! cried he , seizing my arm , and <UNK> from me the weapon that had so badly served me , you want to take my life , do you , my pretty puritan ?: 59.01
<S> i know nothing . can you not understand that monsieur d artagnan , being my friend , might take me into his confidence ? truly ? do you not perceive that i know all your abduction from the little house at st. germain , his despair , that of his friends , and their useless inquiries up to this moment ?: 67.55
<S> i did , replied the count .: 12.24
<S> i do not know her , but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature , and that there is something fatal about her . you are right , said d artagnan ; i will have done with her .: 31.61
<S> at that moment the door opened .: 5.89
<S> are the half of the sum , mother ; the other will be paid in a year . merce de s raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe , and tears , which had hitherto been restrained , now yielded to her emotion , and ran down her cheeks .: 34.84
<S> but we must say farewell , edmond , and let us part . before i leave you , merce de s , have you no request to make ? said the count .: 27.29
<S> an officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawing room , and was advancing towards danglars , preceded by a commissary of police , girded with his scarf .: 61.21
<S> anne questioned d artagnan by a look .: 67.67
<S> on the 4th a yacht will wait for you in the port of bastia , it will be called the <UNK> .: 96.84
<S> yes , you are right ; a <UNK> is needful . still another obstacle , murmured mme .: 86.86
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> arrived in london , you will seek buckingham . i must beg your eminence to observe , said milady , that since the affair of the diamond studs , about which the duke always suspected me , his grace distrusts me . well , this time , said the cardinal , it is not necessary to steal his confidence , but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator . frankly and loyally , repeated milady , with an unspeakable expression of duplicity .: 96.91
<S> a tear , which appeared in the old man s eye , expressed his thanks to the doctor .: 37.88
<S> he descended fifteen steps , and the door of a dungeon was opened , and he was thrust in .: 33.26
<S> athos , said the musketeer .: 15.78
<S> but what astonished franz , who had treated gaetano s description as a fable , was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself .: 86.03
<S> upon my soul , everything degenerates ; and i don t know whether it is the game which leaves no scent , or the dogs that have no noses .: 129.25
<S> the count wished to speak , but a gush of blood stifled him .: 46.18
<S> escape !: 50.00
<S> let us get down , count , and examine this rock . they both alighted .: 58.62
<S> his companions followed his example .: 47.63
<S> to any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his <UNK> condition ; but to his friends to athos and aramis was apparent a certain <UNK> in his gayety .: 123.68
<S> this thought the house of morrel is about to stop payment bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise have done .: 162.32
<S> whom ? the man we are seeking . it seems , said d artagnan , that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have entered , without suspecting it , into the kingdom of mysteries . come , replied the same lofty tone , answer !: 79.81
<S> tell him , answered the brave man , to let the king know that they have not killed me <UNK> .: 60.09
<S> he seated himself at his desk and d artagnan proceeded to examine his face , as he had just examined the letter he held , but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter .: 53.72
<S> at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase , and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times .: 31.33
<S> planchet is brave and shrewd ; they are two qualities out of the four . gentlemen , said aramis , the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet , the most strong , the most clever , or the most brave ; the principal thing is to know which loves money the best . what aramis says is very sensible , replied athos ; we must speculate upon the faults of people , and not upon their virtues .: 127.31
<S> then , once free , from the day and hour and moment when he was so , he could have but one only thought , which was , to gain monte cristo by some means , and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions ; and once there , to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns , and search in the appointed spot , the appointed spot , be it remembered , being the farthest angle in the second opening .: 164.09
<S> it was said that she had poisoned her second husband ; she had tried to assassinate her brother in law ; she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival , and before leaving england she had , it was believed , caused the favorite of the king to be murdered . buckingham ? cried the monk .: 57.47
<S> heavens !: 81.96
<S> i have promised to remain forever with you , and now i could not break my promise if i would .: 31.21
<S> yes , you are right ; i am but a poor friend to you .: 17.95
<S> then , while passing , he had cast a rapid , investigating glance into the kitchen ; and he was obliged to confess to himself , to the shame of the procurator s wife and his own regret , that he did not see that fire , that animation , that bustle , which when a good repast is on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living .: 104.79
<S> you know , gentlemen , that i served the piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant ? yes . well , one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens , who began to march , some with the right foot , others with the left , i succeeded , i did , in making them all begin with the same foot , and i was made lieutenant on the spot . so i presume , said athos , that you have a large number of the nobles with you ? certainly .: 82.05
<S> besides , is he not a butcher s son ?: 52.69
<S> otherwise , you see , although i am sure that general oliver cromwell can intend them no harm , it would have a bad appearance . mordaunt recoiled ; he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at d artagnan , who responded by the most amiable expression that ever <UNK> a human countenance .: 100.12
<S> i do not say i regret ; no , i will never pronounce that sentence , which would not be orthodox . the jesuit raised his hands toward heaven , and the curate did the same .: 41.05
<S> but what has become of m. d e pinay ? replied morrel .: 9.44
<S> as they were going down d artagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their leader .: 34.58
<S> i thought for a long time that he was dumb ; he answers only by signs .: 56.64
<S> one day , as i was conveying my wife back to the louvre , he was coming out as she was going in , and she showed him to me . the devil !: 34.30
<S> in what a tone you speak ! cried valentine .: 49.76
<S> must i always be the same ? said he , and shall i never succeed in overcoming the old leaven ?: 113.85
<S> all the way along d artagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in m. de tre ville , or whether he should only ask him to give him carte blanche for some secret affair .: 78.61
<S> let me see .: 18.82
<S> she wouldn t believe me , saying that she knew anne of austria , who was too proud to love such a <UNK> coxcomb .: 65.35
<S> i do not deny the influence of which you speak , or that i have not myself experienced it , but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good . well , valentine , said morrel with a sigh , we will not discuss the matter further .: 55.86
<S> the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it , and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps , followed by a gentleman in black .: 55.09
<S> bernajoux now fell , and as the guardsmen were only two against four , they began to cry , to the rescue !: 108.68
<S> milady sprang toward him .: 23.98
<S> he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major s little finger ; for the major , like a prudent man , in case of any accident happening to his bank notes , had immediately converted them into an available <UNK> .: 176.50
<S> you will , in turn , enter it , my dear d e pinay , for you will soon be numbered as one of the family .: 35.42
<S> at the hotel de ville ?: 20.67
<S> this time there was no longer any doubt ; it was at the traitor s cross that lesser criminals were executed .: 44.32
<S> you have , indeed , a noble nature , edmond , and i see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment .: 42.10
<S> we can dispose of the business , if we please , in an hour , for i have received a letter from m. delaunay , in which he offers to purchase the good will of the house , to unite with his own , for 300,000 francs .: 54.31
<S> you ought , i say , then , to husband the means you have , however large the sum may be ; but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in the exercises becoming a gentleman .: 126.52
<S> the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent <UNK> .: 240.74
<S> you scoundrel ! cried d artagnan , taking the man for a thief and seizing his sword .: 33.35
<S> today , he said with an effort , today the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt . involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of noirtier s room , where he had seen him the preceding night .: 95.34
<S> i will ask the cardinal . it was the cardinal , then , who informed you of this fe te ? yes , madame , replied the astonished king ; but why do you ask that ? it was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs ? that is to say , madame it was he , sire , it was he ! well , and what does it signify whether it was he or i ?: 33.85
<S> the friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of pierrefonds , to which porthos escorted his friend .: 81.95
<S> you are , then , some secret , implacable , and mortal enemy !: 54.52
<S> it is men who drive me to death ; it is men who make you weep . yes , sire , said aramis , yes , you are right .: 33.77
<S> had not government better profit by it ?: 1066.01
<S> for , notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures , i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young again a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with merce de s , my betrothed ! <UNK> the general , with his head thrown back , hands extended , gaze fixed , looked silently at this dreadful apparition ; then seeking the wall to support him , he glided along close to it until he reached the door , through which he went out backwards , uttering this single mournful , lamentable , distressing cry : edmond dante s ! then , with sighs which were unlike any human sound , he dragged himself to the door , reeled across the courtyard , and falling into the arms of his valet , he said in a voice scarcely intelligible , home , home . the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants , partly recalled his senses , but the ride was short , and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived .: 163.13
<S> the count s anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man .: 71.25
<S> your eminence , it concerns the war which the king , my husband , is now sustaining against his rebellious subjects .: 115.26
<S> i saw the executioner return into the king s room , change his clothes , put on a black hat and a large cloak and disappear .: 71.50
<S> felton , in his rapid walk , reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of james i. and charles i. , furnished by two years of <UNK> meditation and a long sojourn among the puritans .: 226.27
<S> this was more than his life , the life of the woman he loved ; this was , in case of ill fortune , a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions .: 85.08
<S> coward ! he is a coward , indeed , grumbled the host , drawing near to d artagnan , and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man , as the heron of the fable did with the <UNK> he had despised the evening before .: 83.80
<S> give way ! at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head , but it was too late .: 37.31
<S> what is your opinion , gentlemen , and does not m. mouston s suggestion appear to you full of sense ? oh ! said aramis , suppose the master is a puritan ? so much the better , mordioux ! replied d artagnan ; if he is a puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king , and in honor of the news he will kill for us his <UNK> <UNK> . but if he should be a cavalier ? said porthos .: 54.94
<S> thanks to the sale of his horse , he commenced his career with four more crowns than m. de tre ville possessed at the commencement of his .: 72.32
<S> one evening i went , according to custom , to a house which i frequented with much pleasure : when one is young , what can be expected ? one is weak .: 140.88
<S> to leghorn . then why , instead of <UNK> so frequently , do you not sail nearer the wind ? because we should run straight on to the island of rion . you shall pass it by twenty fathoms . take the helm , and let us see what you know . the young man took the helm , felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that , without being a first rate sailor , she yet was tolerably obedient .: 139.82
<S> he replied in <UNK> and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another .: 102.77
<S> it is understood is it not ? but , count , do you remember that the 5th of october child , replied the count , not to know the value of a man s word !: 41.14
<S> yes your friend at least hopes so . come upstairs with me , and i will give it to you . i prefer waiting here , said the messenger , with a smile .: 39.65
<S> parliament indeed ! cried athos .: 114.67
<S> it was from mme .: 25.45
<S> the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key ; but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed .: 40.52
<S> there are about two hundred in paris and three thousand in france ; and then , perhaps , on entering the convent he changed his name .: 53.93
<S> they are quite new , and have not yet been used .: 39.15
<S> ho !: 16.63
<S> he made a great start and looked at me .: 48.65
<S> in consequence , he brought them the key of his own at least such was the apparent motive of his visit .: 65.31
<S> in what am i benefited by accompanying my son so far , since i now abandon him , and allow him to depart alone to the <UNK> <UNK> of africa ?: 181.63
<S> alas , my boy , said he , human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits ; and when i have taught you <UNK> , <UNK> , history , and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted , you will know as much as i do myself .: 103.72
<S> he was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only <UNK> , but just .: 64.94
<S> at least keep him there till my daughter be married . impossible , madame ; justice has its formalities . what , even for me ? said the baroness , half jesting , half in earnest .: 116.56
<S> when i am convinced that the statement is false . what ? the thing is worth looking into , and i will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly . but what is there to investigate , sir ? said albert , enraged beyond measure at beauchamp s last remark .: 104.04
<S> he was thinking by himself , and even seriously <UNK> his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied , with which he did not doubt , as with the lever for which archimedes sought , they should succeed in moving the world , when someone tapped gently at his door .: 187.56
<S> do you not know him ? i have not that honor . you have never heard his name ? never . well , then , he is a bandit , compared to whom the decesaris and the <UNK> were mere children . now then , albert , cried franz , here is a bandit for you at last . i <UNK> you , signor pastrini , that i shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us ; having told you this , begin .: 44.68
<S> he examined him , and found him sound and without blemish .: 94.50
<S> there is your proud and selfish nature .: 175.58
<S> louis xviii .: 14.91
<S> he found athos reclining upon a large sofa , where he was waiting , as he said , for his outfit to come and find him .: 48.98
<S> it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect .: 130.34
<S> the little company started off at a trot on the road to cambrin , where they expected to find the prince .: 47.87
<S> bonacieux , and letting her head sink pensively upon her bosom .: 58.23
<S> and is he aware of the danger he has been in ? i think not . then it will be but charitable to inform him .: 51.76
<S> no , no , said he .: 6.23
<S> i wish , after such a scene , to be alone . mazarin bent low before her .: 52.76
<S> he had received a ball in his thigh , which had broken the bone .: 27.96
<S> what consoles me , said the cardinal after reading the letter , is that , at least , in this chase , d artagnan has done me one good turn he has destroyed broussel .: 89.58
<S> i shall retire and die tranquilly at home . for my part , said porthos , i desire to be made a baron . you shall be one . and have you not seen any of our other friends ? yes , i have seen aramis . and what does he wish ?: 32.63
<S> in that case felton would escape her for in order to secure success , the magic of a <UNK> seduction was necessary .: 165.14
<S> d artagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be described .: 62.73
<S> do you still wish to do so ? i have no wishes , count ; only i fancy i could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else . so much the better , for i must leave you ; but i carry your word with me , do i not ? ah , count , i shall forget it . no , you will not forget it , because you are a man of honor , morrel , because you have taken an oath , and are about to do so again . oh , count , have pity upon me .: 34.64
<S> in a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the rue du helder .: 9.66
<S> treat him kindly , therefore , in the future . captain , said the young king to d artagnan , on descending from the carriage , the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner to day you and your friend the baron du vallon . that was a great honor for d artagnan and for porthos .: 58.56
<S> god will help you . gentlemen , in the name of heaven ! said the wounded man , collecting all his forces , as if to get up , let us not lose time in useless words .: 34.17
<S> the prince had supplied him with fifty light horse , not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queen s generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at pleasure .: 255.16
<S> it was , in fact , mordaunt whom d artagnan had followed , without knowing it .: 33.53
<S> alas , alas , sir , have pity on me ! the old man s eyes remained fixed on the door .: 15.75
<S> come , said boville , with a tone of entire incredulity , five millions to that gentleman who just left , and who bowed to me as though he knew me ? perhaps he knows you , though you do not know him ; m. de monte cristo knows everybody . five millions ! here is his receipt .: 66.74
<S> the skiff lightning . d artagnan had judged correctly ; mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose , and he lost none .: 80.74
<S> i remained in my ignorance , and the count of spada in his poverty .: 60.77
<S> it is not my intention here to enter into an <UNK> of this curious work ; and i shall satisfy myself with referring such of my readers as appreciate the pictures of the period to its pages .: 140.10
<S> the ball struck the animal full in front .: 162.14
<S> can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo ? ah , said the count negligently , looking attentively at morcerf , is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo ? yes , returned franz , finding that the count was coming to the point he wished .: 41.76
<S> no , no , answered dante s ; don t imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby manner .: 29.31
<S> only a few days , replied monte cristo .: 19.70
<S> these steps came on , came fast .: 88.58
<S> besides , i have lost nothing by this journey because i see you . yes , replied anne , but you know why and how i see you ; because , insensible to all my sufferings , you persist in remaining in a city where , by remaining , you run the risk of your life , and make me run the risk of my honor .: 67.68
<S> porthos foamed with rage , and made a movement to rush after d artagnan .: 67.76
<S> i have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is , from whence he came , and whither he is going . where he comes from i am ignorant ; but i can readily tell you where he is going to , and that is down below , without the least doubt . let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make , said franz .: 56.12
<S> d artagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls , and meeting nothing to suspect , regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel .: 117.09
<S> you would wish a notary to be sent for then ? said valentine .: 52.77
<S> d aiguillon , marion de lorme , and several other gay women .: 291.46
<S> albert , completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated monte cristo , was sleeping in an armchair near the window , while the count was <UNK> with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house , when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made albert look up .: 103.00
<S> while we can not and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate .: 122.13
<S> an apartment , as we have said , had been retained beforehand , and thus he had but to go to signor pastrini s hotel .: 43.57
<S> in july we added 1,700,000 francs , it was , you know , the month of the spanish bonds .: 160.82
<S> m. villefort , i beg to remind you my mother speaks to you . if the marquise will deign to repeat the words i but imperfectly caught , i shall be delighted to answer , said m. de villefort .: 63.36
<S> think what a figure you will make when you are asked , how do they execute at rome ? and you reply , i do not know ! and , besides , they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel , who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son .: 101.86
<S> caderousse was , like fernand , <UNK> in the army , but , being married and eight years older , he was merely sent to the frontier .: 79.83
<S> gentlemen , said athos , addressing at the same time his companions and their adversaries , are we ready ? yes ! answered the englishmen and the frenchmen , as with one voice .: 57.35
<S> d artagnan , pressing his hand , repeated his call .: 21.04
<S> athos s horse , where is that ? in the stable . how much is it worth ? fifty pistoles at most . it s worth eighty .: 91.20
<S> d artagnan pulled up his horse , and whilst his musketeers continued to charge , he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down .: 66.80
<S> an academician would say that the <UNK> of the fashionable world are <UNK> of flowers which attract inconstant <UNK> , famished bees , and buzzing <UNK> .: 1147.60
<S> as he finished , the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which , fortunately for him , had been left out of the cellar .: 78.61
<S> i always suppose anything people please , and , besides , you must <UNK> something to <UNK> minds .: 247.93
<S> the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtier s lips , seemed to start from his eyes .: 48.65
<S> we will cross switzerland , and go down into italy by the saint <UNK> .: 138.40
<S> but the glass cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies .: 147.87
<S> let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three musketeers behind him ; if we see a close carriage , at all suspicious in appearance , come out , let us fall upon it .: 111.42
<S> dante s listened with admiring attention to all he said ; some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew , or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire .: 150.50
<S> i can not help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife . do you think so ? i am sure of it . and you have heard his fortune mentioned ? nothing else was talked of ; only some said he was worth millions , and others that he did not possess a <UNK> . and what is your opinion ? i ought not to influence you , because it is only my own personal impression . well , and it is that my opinion is , that all these old <UNK> s , these ancient <UNK> , for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces , my opinion , i say , is , that they have buried their millions in corners , the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons , who have done the same from generation to generation ; and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance , like the <UNK> of the <UNK> , which , from being constantly gazed upon , have become reflected in them . certainly , said danglars , and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land . very little , at least ; i know of none which cavalcanti possesses , excepting his palace in lucca . ah , he has a palace ? said danglars , laughing ; come , that is something . yes ; and more than that , he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house .: 99.87
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes , for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness , and which ran as follows : madame and most faithful wife . debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness , whose face became covered with blushes .: 69.62
<S> the king signed the order for release , and tre ville carried it away without delay .: 71.09
<S> if we ever escape together , half this treasure is yours ; if i die here , and you escape alone , the whole belongs to you . but , inquired dante s hesitating , has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves ? no , no , be easy on that score ; the family is extinct .: 92.93
<S> when landing at portsmouth , milady was an englishwoman whom the persecutions of the french drove from la rochelle ; when landing at boulogne , after a two days passage , she passed for a frenchwoman whom the english persecuted at portsmouth out of their hatred for france .: 240.93
<S> why did you not say so at once , my dear sir !: 21.32
<S> my friend , exclaimed monte cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness .: 22.85
<S> i will have three fleur de lis embroidered on it in gold , and will give it to your company as a standard . monseigneur , said m. de tre ville , that will be unjust to the guardsmen .: 59.70
<S> thinking of all this , and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse , d artagnan completed his short journey , and arrived at st. germain .: 50.16
<S> but how can lord de winter , my protector , my father , asked felton , possibly be mixed up with all this ? listen , felton , resumed milady , for by the side of base and contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures .: 101.97
<S> as for me , i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one ; she will enrich you , and you will <UNK> her . albert shook his head , and looked thoughtful .: 51.32
<S> i am glad to see you pay attention to the usages of the world .: 30.29
<S> what is there , then , behind this wall ?: 27.68
<S> this double error became an irresistible reality , and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth , he bounded from his hiding place , and with two strides , at the risk of being seen , at the risk of alarming valentine , at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl , he crossed the flower garden , which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake , and having passed the rows of orange trees which extended in front of the house , he reached the step , ran quickly up and pushed the door , which opened without offering any resistance .: 77.73
<S> i believe i saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court .: 92.58
<S> to whom , then ? to your new master . who and where is he ? he is here . and kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father , said hayde e , in a tone of <UNK> anger .: 74.53
<S> four shots replied to them almost instantaneously , but much better aimed than those of the <UNK> ; three soldiers fell dead , and one of the pioneers was wounded .: 215.87
<S> what is he waiting for ?: 24.45
<S> everyone looked at carlini ; the sheath at his belt was empty .: 96.92
<S> d artagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife , so that she might not be anxious about him , but planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was , while he , planchet , remembering her <UNK> of tongue , would die of anxiety if she did know .: 113.45
<S> the marriage feast chapter 6 .: 117.43
<S> the young man , in reply , took up the chisel , bent it into the form of a horseshoe , and then as readily straightened it .: 62.06
<S> no , never !: 21.09
<S> well , my faith !: 12.40
<S> still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another , like sentinels .: 123.84
<S> he took from the duke all the steel <UNK> and silver <UNK> and replaced them with silver <UNK> and wooden <UNK> , pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at vincennes , he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide .: 195.86
<S> the sight of this officer recalled villefort from the third heaven to earth ; he composed his face , as we have before described , and said , i have read the letter , sir , and you have acted rightly in arresting this man ; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy . we know nothing as yet of the conspiracy , monsieur ; all the papers found have been sealed up and placed on your desk .: 107.40
<S> carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened .: 67.74
<S> i depend upon you to escort me home .: 60.19
<S> well , said he to morcerf , but i think your father will not be the only angry one ; m. and madame danglars will think me a very ill <UNK> person .: 60.32
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme .: 23.92
<S> we still remain four friends devoted to each other ; but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him , of being mazarinists or frondists , then we are only two . is monsieur aramis with d artagnan ? asked lord de winter .: 68.48
<S> then all became clear and manifest to me , and i reproached myself with what had happened , as though i myself had done the guilty deed .: 116.31
<S> what can i do for the son ?: 19.02
<S> thank god , we can keep a secret . the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker .: 84.07
<S> come , come , my little fellow , don t be angry .: 13.32
<S> meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs , my little fellow ?: 133.70
<S> this did not seem sufficient ; the man , or rather the ghost for he trod so softly that no sound was heard then poured out about a spoonful into the glass , and drank it .: 125.13
<S> only he is not quite sure about the women , for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish , so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues . the two young men looked at morcerf as if to say , are you mad , or are you laughing at us ? and i also , said morrel thoughtfully , have heard something like this from an old sailor named penelon . ah , cried albert , it is very lucky that m. morrel comes to aid me ; you are vexed , are you not , that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth ? my dear albert , said debray , what you tell us is so extraordinary . ah , because your ambassadors and your <UNK> do not tell you of them they have no time .: 86.25
<S> he is waiting till your majesty is ready . i am .: 55.90
<S> all these trees , great or small , were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows , one of the three curses of provence , the others being the <UNK> and the parliament .: 173.35
<S> you must dress yourself , raoul , said athos , i am going to present you to some one . to day , monsieur ? asked the young man .: 19.28
<S> oh , sire , replied the minister , we have no occasion to invent any ; every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial <UNK> , coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render , but can not ; they trust to fortune , and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions . well , sir , go , said louis xviii. , and remember that i am waiting for you . i will but go and return , sire ; i shall be back in ten minutes . and i , sire , said m. de blacas , will go and find my messenger . wait , sir , wait , said louis xviii .: 75.49
<S> d artagnan is for mazarin , he said to himself .: 17.15
<S> you have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door . go , sir , said the queen ; i will follow you . d artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box .: 25.94
<S> i agree to athos s plan .: 49.70
<S> you have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address , but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded them .: 334.23
<S> that s all that is necessary , said athos ; now for my idea . i should like , however , to comprehend , said porthos .: 27.66
<S> under any other circumstances he would have <UNK> the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry , but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak .: 283.12
<S> you know , raoul , grimaud is an old and zealous servant ; he will follow you . yes , sir , answered raoul .: 32.64
<S> we shall meet again in better days . and whenever we find each other , in whatever place it may be , said kitty , you will find me loving you as i love you today . <UNK> oaths ! said athos , while d artagnan went to conduct kitty downstairs .: 102.76
<S> it was evident , from her figure and the perfumes she had about her , that she was young and fastidious in her tastes , but that was all .: 53.57
<S> and who knows it ? noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out .: 22.32
<S> i am not mistaken ? d artagnan ! cried rochefort .: 19.88
<S> or rather at what he said ? and what was he saying ? he said this , madame : mazarin is a stumbling block .: 80.57
<S> it was this that made me start when you said the other day , at m. de morcerf s , that messrs. thomson french were your bankers .: 107.30
<S> it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief , but her total <UNK> to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act .: 135.08
<S> nevertheless , they had not the power of convincing milady .: 44.67
<S> all these old soldiers commit <UNK> which were tolerated in the time of the emperor , but which are not suffered now , for the people here do not like soldiers of such <UNK> conduct . monsieur , i replied , it is not for myself that i entreat your interference i should grieve for him or avenge him , but my poor brother had a wife , and were anything to happen to me , the poor creature would perish from want , for my brother s pay alone kept her .: 156.21
<S> i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it . you don t mention those who aided and <UNK> the deed , said caderousse .: 147.81
<S> the contract was to have been signed three days since ; we shall find it all ready , and can sign it today . but the mourning ? said franz , hesitating .: 65.64
<S> you shall be my body guard .: 91.89
<S> monsieur mordaunt , he said , since , after running after one another so long , chance has at last brought us together , let us have a little conversation , if you please . chapter <UNK> .: 68.80
<S> now , especially , did he find the description valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him ; he arrived safely at the top of the staircase , and while he was feeling his way , a sob indicated the direction he was to take .: 74.88
<S> didn t you see that monsieur d artagnan mounted with difficulty ?: 55.93
<S> listen , said he ; just now i told you it was of m. de monte cristo you must demand an explanation . yes ; and we are going to his house . reflect , morcerf , one moment before you go . on what shall i reflect ? on the importance of the step you are taking . is it more serious than going to m. danglars ? yes ; m. danglars is a money lover , and those who love money , you know , think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel .: 65.32
<S> porthos has , perhaps , sixty thousand francs income .: 71.01
<S> i do not know , but he wishes to speak to you . ah ? said monte cristo , i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult ! i do not think that such is his intention , said morrel .: 25.66
<S> in fact , at one of the doors which opened into the queen s apartment appeared the pretty mme .: 43.63
<S> we render service to god , madame , in serving a prince so unfortunate , a queen so virtuous .: 196.99
<S> the queen smiled , but instead of answering : see , de winter , she said , i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen ; and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame . then turning toward her daughter : what do you want , henrietta ? she demanded .: 54.21
<S> an elegant carriage waited below , and as it was drawn by two excellent horses , they were soon at the place royale .: 54.54
<S> night arrived ; i allowed it to become quite dark .: 184.93
<S> in the place of the fowl a dish of <UNK> beans made its appearance an enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show themselves .: 224.59
<S> well , does not this tell you that in grief , as in life , there is always something to look forward to beyond ?: 127.27
<S> we must inform the queen . ah , my faith , yes ! said porthos and d artagnan , at the same time ; we are coming nearer to it now . inform the queen ! said athos ; and how ?: 29.74
<S> maximilian s avowal chapter <UNK> .: 307.53
<S> an entire wing of the villa was burnt down ; but what of that , as long as carmela was safe and <UNK> ?: 195.38
<S> ah , said he , between his teeth , is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps ? follow me , monsieur , said mazarin .: 65.78
<S> the devil ! cried aramis , you have a magnificent horse there , porthos . yes , replied porthos , it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first .: 22.45
<S> it is very interesting , he said , but it must be very tedious for a lifetime . yes .: 30.41
<S> it was the island of monte cristo .: 9.51
<S> but one fine day i learned that the <UNK> of this telegraph was only a poor wretch , hired for twelve hundred francs a year , and employed all day , not in studying the heavens like an <UNK> , or in gazing on the water like an <UNK> , or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him , but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white <UNK> , black <UNK> fellow insect , four or five leagues distant from him .: 178.89
<S> he ran to porthos and threw himself into his arms ; the whole body of servants , arranged in a semi circle at a respectful distance , looked on with humble curiosity .: 73.44
<S> morrel bounded to the door , opened it , and found valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs .: 23.70
<S> i will go by the way of boulogne to clear the way ; athos will set out two hours after , by that of amiens ; aramis will follow us by that of noyon ; as to d artagnan , he will go by what route he thinks is best , in planchet s clothes , while planchet will follow us like d artagnan , in the uniform of the guards . gentlemen , said athos , my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair .: 57.94
<S> i have proof that her majesty , notwithstanding her excellent heart , has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his eminence persons who had served her . trust me , madame ; the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons , but we must not put faith in appearances .: 102.05
<S> the queen made a sign for every one , except mazarin , to quit the room ; and gondy bowed , as if to leave with the rest .: 40.55
<S> his resolution not to sign lasted two days , after which he offered a million for some food .: 120.81
<S> but enough of money matters .: 108.95
<S> the angel was a demon ; the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a church . and what did the count do ? the count was of the highest nobility .: 63.37
<S> at the knock , the door was immediately opened , and the young man who was seated beside the countess , in obedience to the italian custom , instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers , who , in turn , would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors .: 61.60
<S> the cardinal , in deep thought and in silence , began to take off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament , and to attire himself in the military coat , which he wore with a certain degree of easy grace , owing to his former campaigns in italy .: 81.56
<S> he remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his destiny .: 51.22
<S> if rage or sorrow ever torture the heart , it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy rival .: 239.99
<S> he has been here a week , with the instinct of a <UNK> , hunting by himself .: 63.54
<S> franz could not <UNK> breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert , to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite , since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex .: 421.60
<S> after casting a rapid glance around him , in order to assure himself that he was unobserved , he entered by the small gate , and , carefully closing and securing it after him , proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier .: 68.08
<S> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .: 6862.05
<S> my god , my god ! said she , thou knowest in what holy cause i suffer ; give me , then , strength to suffer . the door opened gently ; the beautiful <UNK> pretended not to hear the noise , and in a voice broken by tears , she continued : god of vengeance !: 72.63
<S> d artagnan s penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost .: 43.68
<S> your eminence is right .: 17.09
<S> what the devil !: 8.64
<S> her attitude , though perfectly natural for an eastern woman would , in a european , have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect .: 591.06
<S> the shade of cardinal richelieu .: 57.69
<S> this is the first time i have gone without my dinner for ten years , and it is generally my best meal . what do you think , d artagnan ? asked athos .: 17.19
<S> you are not judges !: 47.29
<S> very rich , do you think ? replied the young man .: 13.34
<S> but unfortunately i must wait . <UNK> you must wait for what ? asked caderousse .: 80.24
<S> the regiment of the guards was <UNK> among the first gentlemen of the kingdom ; and d artagnan , followed by a lackey , and traveling with four magnificent horses , despite the simplicity of his uniform , could not fail to make a sensation .: 56.27
<S> that great giant who was there gave it to him . in that case , said bazin , he must be pretty sick . so sick that he is dying , and he wants to confess to the coadjutor , who , they say , has power to remit great sins . and does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him ? to be sure ; the coadjutor has promised . who told you that ? monsieur maillard himself . you have seen him , then ? certainly ; i was there when he fell . what were you doing there ? i was shouting , down with mazarin ! death to the cardinal ! the italian to the gallows ! isn t that what you would have me shout ? be quiet , you rascal ! said bazin , looking uneasily around .: 72.08
<S> good day , monsieur dulaurier , replied d artagnan .: 16.65
<S> but , she exclaimed , suddenly , arsenic is indelible , <UNK> ; in whatsoever way it is absorbed , it will be found again in the body of the victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to cause death . precisely so , cried monte cristo precisely so ; and this is what i said to my worthy adelmonte .: 109.84
<S> coquenard .: 51.74
<S> but the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a word .: 75.69
<S> when the count arrived , he had under his touch his books and arms , his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures ; his dogs , whose caresses he loved , welcomed him in the antechamber ; the birds , whose songs delighted him , cheered him with their music ; and the house , awakened from its long sleep , like the sleeping beauty in the wood , lived , sang , and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished , and in which , when we are forced to leave them , we leave a part of our souls .: 115.58
<S> d artagnan needs to be alone , to weep and to sleep .: 53.54
<S> both were free from the fear of pursuit ; nobody ever came into milady s apartment before nine o clock , and it would require three hours to go from the castle to london .: 110.64
<S> you allow me to give you this title ? continued the count in french , it is necessary to excite this man s confidence . you can speak before me , said franz ; i am a friend of the count s. good ! returned peppino .: 40.68
<S> that s strange !: 54.09
<S> stop , and let us talk . talking with you brings me misfortune , said porthos .: 71.49
<S> at the extremity of the wood d artagnan perceived the road that had been described to him , and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle .: 36.28
<S> you have misunderstood me , all sympathy is extinct between us . <UNK> that you are ! ah !: 178.50
<S> but you , general , were you not at whitehall ? no , said cromwell .: 29.75
<S> i believe her to be a cardinalist ; she must know nothing of the matter . then , said aramis , i take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her . you , aramis ? cried the three friends .: 39.01
<S> the porter was in attendance ; he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the count s approach .: 41.67
<S> aramis blushed excessively , and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon .: 146.66
<S> at the next inn you will find a wounded man , now being attended by our servants , who has asked the assistance of a minister of god . i will go , said the monk .: 38.81
<S> well , said danglars , did you see him ? i have just left him , answered caderousse .: 13.10
<S> like all persons of real genius , milady knew what suited her nature and her means .: 263.91
<S> you have my promise , he said , after a minute s pause , extending his hand to monte cristo .: 20.17
<S> the contract shall not be signed ! cried morrel .: 43.60
<S> he turned up his <UNK> <UNK> and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor , but did not fail , however , to remark that mordaunt was looking about him in a singular manner .: 79.26
<S> you are the notary <UNK> to sell the country house that i wish to purchase , monsieur ? asked monte cristo .: 75.31
<S> why should you expose your game to your adversary ?: 111.10
<S> the hungry friends , followed by their lackeys , were seen haunting the quays and guard rooms , picking up among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with ; for according to the advice of aramis , it was prudent to <UNK> <UNK> right and left in prosperity , in order to reap a few in time of need .: 235.26
<S> now i am alone , my dear athos , said d artagnan ; open the door , i beg of you . instantly , said athos .: 15.57
<S> but wait a minute , said m. de tre ville , stopping him .: 18.30
<S> i ll circulate that saying , be assured , my dear fellow .: 77.80
<S> ah , wretch ! cried she , you have <UNK> betrayed me , and still more , you have my secret !: 57.31
<S> alas ! said charles , that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault . he continued his walk , but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces , when a furious fellow , leaning between two soldiers , spat in the king s face , as once an infamous and accursed jew spit in the face of jesus of <UNK> .: 135.68
<S> i love and esteem you , because honest folks are so rare .: 191.52
<S> the count of monte cristo ! she murmured .: 10.09
<S> madame , we are yours , body and soul . oh , sirs , said the queen , moved even to tears , this is the first time for five years i have felt the least approach to joy or hope .: 58.19
<S> d artagnan fancied quite naturally , according to his custom , that he must be the object of their conversation , and listened .: 37.89
<S> i drew near , and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag .: 88.70
<S> take this ring ; raise money with it , and let your husband set out . in an hour you shall be obeyed . you see the address , said the queen , speaking so low that mme .: 62.52
<S> suddenly edmond saw the gloomy , pale , and threatening countenance of fernand , as it was defined in the shadow .: 63.67
<S> as soon as his engagement with the patron of la jeune ame lie ended , he would hire a small vessel on his own account for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres and under some pretext land at the island of monte cristo .: 92.79
<S> yes , surely , he came with the prince ; a charming young man ; he is one of your friends then , monsieur le comte ? yes , sir , answered athos , agitated ; so much so that i wish to see him if possible . quite possible , sir ; do me the favor to accompany me and i will conduct you to <UNK> . halloo , there ! cried aramis , turning around ; what a noise behind us ! a body of cavaliers is coming toward us , said chatillon .: 57.67
<S> stay there , said aramis ; i shall return immediately . the two friends went toward the shed .: 25.89
<S> pass your arms around my neck , and fear nothing . but i shall make you lose your balance , and we shall both be dashed to pieces . don t be afraid .: 78.60
<S> poor dear girl !: 50.89
<S> it was in the name of comte de wardes .: 18.38
<S> pardieu , said i , my good gentleman , i have a horse to sell , too . ay , and a very fine one !: 52.96
<S> the boat was built for speed ; her two <UNK> wheels were like two wings with which she <UNK> the water like a bird .: 227.35
<S> the luck had turned , and groslow , having won some hundred pistoles , was in the <UNK> possible humor .: 163.20
<S> c sar and his father searched , examined , scrutinized , but found nothing , or at least very little ; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate , and about the same in ready money ; but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired : look well among my uncle s papers ; there is a will . they sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done , but it was fruitless .: 165.94
<S> d artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could , mistaking one sleeve for the other , so greatly was he still agitated .: 109.28
<S> d artagnan took his hat , examined the hole made by the ball , and shook his head .: 26.27
<S> the very dogs that wander <UNK> and <UNK> in the streets find some <UNK> hand to cast them a mouthful of bread ; and that a man , a christian , should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians , is too horrible for belief .: 229.67
<S> as for her husband , he was a strapping fellow of forty , or five and forty , who had more than once , in time of danger , given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage . and you say , interrupted monte cristo that this took place towards the year 1829 , your excellency . in what month ? june . the beginning or the end ? the evening of the 3rd . <UNK> ah , said monte cristo the evening of the 3rd of june , 1829 .: 95.11
<S> you can ride , you can go and come and fight for the cause of the people .: 49.52
<S> i have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good ; treat me in the same way .: 120.35
<S> your majesty is bored ?: 87.54
<S> it is you , your honor , he said , advancing toward d artagnan ; and i am truly pleased to meet you . d artagnan looked attentively at friquet and recognized the little chorister of the rue de la calandre .: 38.06
<S> unfortunately , there are great words , as there are great men ; i have measured them .: 73.14
<S> yes , dead , alas !: 29.57
<S> i confess this <UNK> me . and it has staggered everybody .: 231.39
<S> no doubt m. danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs .: 209.11
<S> the old man recognized his child , and carlini recognized the old man .: 26.26
<S> you do not believe me ? my lord , i never believe cardinals who are not priests . well , on the faith of a minister . you are no longer a minister , my lord ; you are a prisoner . then , on the honor of a mazarin , as i am and ever shall be , i hope , said the cardinal .: 35.83
<S> well , i will go to england a second time ; i will go and find buckingham . you shall not do that , d artagnan , said athos , coolly .: 21.65
<S> can i be of service to your majesty ? said all at once a voice full of sweetness and pity .: 51.48
<S> the sound of heavy steps was heard above his head .: 45.11
<S> the coadjutor , dragged along with his fugitive forces , passed near the group formed by athos , raoul and aramis .: 97.45
<S> no boat ! exclaimed groslow ; it is impossible . tis true , however , answered the sailor ; there s nothing in the wake of the ship ; besides , here s the end of the cable . what s the matter ? cried mordaunt , who , coming up out of the hatchway , rushed to the stern , waving his torch .: 37.94
<S> then did you not observe the agitation in the palais royal , the passing to and fro of busy people ?: 106.36
<S> another queen in want of help .: 73.66
<S> rita lay between them .: 535.21
<S> as for me , i must look after the anchoring , and dress the ship in mourning . the owner did not wait for a second invitation .: 69.65
<S> the story interests you , does it not , sir ? inquired caderousse .: 38.53
<S> no , but franz has ; for heaven s sake , not a word of this before him .: 37.40
<S> and you have , i am sure , the fullest confidence in my honor .: 55.89
<S> the whole intrigue is political , and there is not the least question of love in this letter ; but , on the other hand , there is abundant question of you . the cardinal took the letter , and read it with the greatest attention ; then , when he had arrived at the end of it , he read it a second time .: 34.36
<S> euge nie bowed coldly to the count , and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study , whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with <UNK> notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that of m. cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise d armilly , her singing teacher .: 230.04
<S> yes ; you said you had an idea , said athos .: 27.83
<S> yes .: 18.24
<S> sire , replied the queen , with a faltering voice , because , in the midst of such a crowd as this , i feared some accident might happen to them . and you were wrong , madame .: 37.61
<S> the night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy .: 91.57
<S> we don t know the <UNK> , and shall never find the wall .: 61.57
<S> and what is it to be ?: 13.85
<S> if i stay in paris i can not go to rome ; if i became pope i could not continue to be prime minister ; and it is only by continuing prime minister that i can make monsieur d artagnan a captain and monsieur du vallon a baron . true , said aramis , so , as i am in a <UNK> , i withdraw my proposition , so far as it relates to the voyage to rome and monseigneur s resignation . i am to remain minister , then ? said mazarin .: 95.36
<S> go , young men !: 30.30
<S> perhaps you had a spy at your heels ; and your visit , if it should ever be known to the cardinal , will thus seem legitimate . d artagnan drew up his request , and m. de tre ville , on receiving it , assured him that by two o clock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective <UNK> of the travelers .: 59.69
<S> sir , said villefort , after the first salutations were over , you were sent for by m. noirtier , whom you see here .: 34.95
<S> yes , sir , replied the coachman .: 8.18
<S> do you grasp that ? said athos , shrugging his shoulders ; the daughter of henry iv .: 22.30
<S> totally disregarding the business of the stage , he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman , aided by a powerful opera glass ; but , alas , this attempt to attract notice wholly failed ; not even curiosity had been excited , and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures , into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing , were all so much engrossed with themselves , their lovers , or their own thoughts , that they had not so much as noticed him or the <UNK> of his glass .: 185.35
<S> she would not be weary , thank god !: 47.82
<S> aramis , he continued , was intimate with a young needlewoman from tours , a cousin of his , named marie michon . ah , i knew her ! cried the duchess .: 73.56
<S> no , he went out early this morning , replied the valet .: 33.49
<S> mamma , mamma , said i , are we really to be killed ? and at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lamentations .: 79.25
<S> aramis here ? cried athos .: 50.62
<S> she remained nearly always in her second floor chamber , shivering in her chair , or stretched languid and feeble on her bed , while her husband kept his daily watch at the door a duty he performed with so much the greater <UNK> , as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his <UNK> , who never saw him without breaking out into bitter <UNK> against fate ; to all of which her husband would calmly return an <UNK> reply , in these philosophic words : hush , la carconte .: 327.90
<S> i must leave you , said du tremblay ; i am sent for to sign the release of a prisoner .: 43.61
<S> during the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind ; now another object , not less terrible , suddenly presented itself .: 111.05
<S> when they reached the street , aramis said : well , athos , what do you think ? of whom ? pardieu !: 24.20
<S> these words of felton s passed like ice through her veins .: 176.05
<S> if he send me his poniard , it will signify that the emperor s intentions are not favorable , and i am to set fire to the powder ; if , on the contrary , he send me his ring , it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him , and i am to extinguish the match and leave the <UNK> untouched . my friend , said my mother , when your master s orders arrive , if it is the poniard which he sends , instead of <UNK> us by that horrible death which we both so much dread , you will <UNK> kill us with this same poniard , will you not ? yes , vasiliki , replied selim tranquilly .: 99.16
<S> desire the french attendants not to weary her with questions , but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire .: 353.63
<S> if he did not come , the painful sensation became most intense ; if , on the contrary , he appeared , his noble countenance , his brilliant eyes , his amiability , his polite attention even towards madame danglars , soon dispelled every impression of fear .: 121.58
<S> then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the cellar .: 117.21
<S> fortunately , by our marriage contract , the survivor takes everything . all ? yes , all . you are a woman of precaution , i see , my dear madame coquenard , said porthos , <UNK> the hand of the procurator s wife tenderly .: 75.39
<S> it was that of la carconte .: 19.92
<S> they had gone rather more than a league and had begun to <UNK> the first houses of the village , the red <UNK> roofs of which stood out from the green trees which surrounded them , when , coming toward them mounted on a mule , they perceived a poor monk , whose large hat and gray worsted dress made them take him for an augustine brother .: 146.03
<S> why i was here only ten or twelve days ago .: 40.85
<S> the report of firearms was heard near the rue saint denis and occasionally church bells began to ring <UNK> and at the caprice of the populace .: 208.70
<S> felton jumped <UNK> , climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the <UNK> , saluted milady a last time , and took his course toward the city .: 136.31
<S> another recollection contributed also to <UNK> raoul : on their arrival at <UNK> he had perceived , hidden behind a screen of poplars , a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it , and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention .: 305.99
<S> it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak , and that milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say , and to <UNK> them in her memory when they should be spoken .: 71.32
<S> here i am , pursuing you remorselessly , he said with a <UNK> smile .: 99.25
<S> i tell you that with that wretched sum , continued andrea , i could obtain a coat , and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting . of course of course , said the prisoners ; anyone can see he s a gentleman ! well , then , lend him the twenty francs , said the keeper , leaning on the other shoulder ; surely you will not refuse a comrade ! <UNK> i am no comrade of these people , said the young man , proudly , you have no right to insult me thus . the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs , and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner , raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper .: 89.71
<S> above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another , inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest .: 211.51
<S> caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other .: 47.14
<S> the queen was in a morning gown , but it became her still ; for , like diana of <UNK> and <UNK> , anne of austria enjoyed the privilege of remaining ever beautiful ; nevertheless , this morning she looked handsomer than usual , for her eyes had all the sparkle inward satisfaction adds to expression .: 254.99
<S> porthos was discontented with his condition .: 70.52
<S> you are questioning me like a king s attorney .: 49.87
<S> these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long ; they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing , so legible that dante s could easily read it , as well as make out the sense it being in italian , a language he , as a provenc al , perfectly understood .: 232.82
<S> it is said that mazarin , who , though a cardinal , had not taken such vows as to prevent it , was secretly married to anne of austria . la porte s memoirs .: 103.33
<S> my mother inherited an estate from her husband , you have assassinated her ; my name would have secured me the paternal estate , you have deprived me of it ; you have despoiled me of my fortune .: 60.42
<S> in all , three clerks and a half , which , for the time , argued a very extensive <UNK> .: 132.85
<S> no , you sounded me , nothing more .: 69.30
<S> ho ! exclaimed d artagnan , picking up a louis and displaying it ; here s a louis that smells <UNK> of straw . mousqueton blushed so <UNK> that the gascon began to laugh at him and said : porthos would be angry , my dear monsieur mousqueton , but i pardon you , only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke , so be gay come along . mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance , saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it .: 164.81
<S> but where is my old friend winter ? the two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence .: 57.89
<S> what is it ? listen , said the guide ; i said to myself , something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years , so i began to sound the wall . ah , cried monte cristo , remembering the abbe s two hiding places .: 83.38
<S> the nephew replied no ; perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question .: 106.26
<S> but pride restrained him and he did not utter it .: 72.44
<S> i told my wife several times that it was surprising that linen <UNK> should live in such houses as those , in houses that had no signs ; but she always laughed at me .: 198.55
<S> of course it is of no consequence , he added , with a withering smile .: 28.05
<S> do you know the decision we have come to , mother ? have we come to any ? yes ; it is decided that you are to live at marseilles , and that i am to leave for africa , where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear , instead of the one i have thrown aside . merce de s sighed .: 50.87
<S> the jesuit persisted in his opinion .: 70.23
<S> two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part , while i must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person i declared could exculpate me if he would .: 135.35
<S> the two gentlemen were obliged , therefore , to get off their horses and take a boat ; and in that strange manner they approached the louvre .: 40.39
<S> don t you remember , porthos , we saw her at general cromwell s ? the roll call continued .: 133.22
<S> have you been working all night ?: 42.63
<S> you know something of that , as well as i do , i think .: 14.46
<S> he made a sign , which i understood , but the king s guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard .: 53.41
<S> they advanced towards a boat , which a custom house officer held by a chain , near the quay .: 145.72
<S> this threatening answer , unluckily for the court , produced quite a different effect to that which was intended .: 166.58
<S> this time kitty was nowhere waiting for him ; neither in the antechamber , nor in the corridor , nor beneath the great door .: 92.40
<S> as she told the queen , she had not seen her husband since his liberation ; she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal a change which had since been <UNK> by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort , who had become the best friend of bonacieux , and had persuaded him , without much trouble , that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife , but that it was only a political precaution .: 57.92
<S> it is on her account i am here ; i wish to see valentine . <UNK> villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball ; so he only said that she had gone out with her step mother , and that she should be fetched .: 53.72
<S> whitehall .: 245.37
<S> volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg s goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg collection will remain freely available for generations to come .: 27.40
<S> this costume is a fancy one , it appears , and the resemblance is so great that i think i still see my mother the same as she was in 1830 .: 76.53
<S> far from wishing my lord to quit paris , i hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister , as he is a great statesman .: 166.41
<S> bonacieux expected him .: 58.36
<S> you see , mother , i treat you handsomely for thirty five francs . albert then took a pen , and wrote : frs .: 75.53
<S> listen , if you please , till i have finished speaking , replied monte cristo .: 21.65
<S> now , grimaud , you come here , climb up to the window again and tell us if mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to bed .: 62.21
<S> they were four honest soldiers , each with a good heart , a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it .: 49.08
<S> now this was a sunday , and the abbe had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him .: 54.08
<S> the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself , and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is <UNK> . had morrel even any suspicions , so much kindness would have dispelled them .: 260.90
<S> but why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven o clock of the morning in the month of january ? sir , said planchet , you must know ; but , perhaps you ought not to know tell us what , returned d artagnan , but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains . sir , said the prudent planchet , in the first place , are you on good terms with monsieur de rochefort ? perfectly ; one of my dearest friends . ah !: 54.47
<S> will you allow me , father ? said carmela .: 38.81
<S> the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man , who , mounted on a chair , was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and <UNK> of clematis that <UNK> over the trellis at his window .: 122.92
<S> drive to the palace , said comminges to the coachman , who was by then more dead than alive .: 53.98
<S> he had stopped , like raoul , at the hotel of the bell and bottle , the best at compiegne ; and had started again on his journey , saying that he should sleep at noyon .: 55.79
<S> monsieur passed along the front of the line ; then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments , m. dessessart , captain of the guards , as well as the others .: 59.45
<S> why , in passing through lilliers you will send me your chaise , with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal . well . you have , no doubt , some order from the cardinal about you ? i have my full power . show it to the abbess , and tell her that someone will come and fetch me , either today or tomorrow , and that i am to follow the person who presents himself in your name . very well . don t forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess . to what purpose ? i am a victim of the cardinal .: 68.96
<S> ah ! said aramis .: 8.65
<S> her forehead almost touched the carpet , when the count sprang forward and raised her .: 64.65
<S> he shall assume a disguise , and place himself in front of the convent .: 83.49
<S> letters had been despatched to m. cavalcanti , as the count s father , who highly approved of the union , regretted his <UNK> to leave parma at that time , and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres .: 141.57
<S> but surely you are monsieur d artagnan ? and thou planchet ! cried the lieutenant .: 41.34
<S> and if the suspicions of your majesty , which i still continue to doubt , should prove to have any foundation , what a terrible disclosure , what a fearful scandal ! but as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief , he should have been louis xiii .: 110.79
<S> and you , my friend , there is a <UNK> for your trouble ; you will tell monsieur de tre ville that monsieur aramis is very much obliged to him .: 29.35
<S> one question first .: 171.10
<S> i will make you another offer . what is that ? i do not offer you a million , because i have it not ; but i will give you a hundred crowns if , the first time you go to marseilles , you will seek out a young girl named merce de s , at the catalans , and give her two lines from me . <UNK> if i took them , and were detected , i should lose my place , which is worth two thousand francs a year ; so that i should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred . well , said dante s , mark this ; if you refuse at least to tell merce de s i am here , i will some day hide myself behind the door , and when you enter i will dash out your brains with this stool . threats ! cried the jailer , retreating and putting himself on the defensive ; you are certainly going mad .: 55.60
<S> a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth , and he breathed painfully , and with extreme difficulty .: 105.32
<S> yes , my lord , replied the servant , m .: 9.53
<S> felton made a sign that she should not be disturbed ; and when all was arranged , he went out quietly with the soldiers .: 30.76
<S> dante s saluted villefort and retired .: 59.50
<S> the southern districts were ill watched in particular , in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in <UNK> , ni mes , or <UNK> s .: 392.26
<S> the <UNK> would not have objected , while he was about it , to have made some <UNK> in the garden , but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched .: 92.88
<S> bonacieux opened the door of a closet , which was entirely dark , and led d artagnan into it .: 26.96
<S> at length , with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench , and found himself on his feet .: 22.00
<S> the jailer came in the evening .: 28.09
<S> at six o clock lord de winter came in .: 14.96
<S> you can t imagine , my dear fellow , the sort of man he is .: 27.69
<S> this point , settled , the duke turned to d artagnan .: 30.47
<S> at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather <UNK> .: 73.51
<S> the title attracted me ; i took them home with me , with the permission of the guardian , and devoured them .: 97.24
<S> it is done , monsieur , she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her throat .: 53.59
<S> she will not hear what we say ; she never goes to bed before midnight . d artagnan cast a glance around him .: 44.10
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> it is a beautiful diamond left by poor edmond dante s , to be sold , and the money divided between his father , merce de s , his betrothed bride , fernand , danglars , and myself .: 56.32
<S> with this animal , which he called pistache , he was often shut up for hours alone , superintending , as every one supposed , its education .: 228.45
<S> this money was for her ; i destined it for her , and , knowing the treachery of the sea i buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at marseilles , on the alle es de meilhan .: 70.57
<S> i have it still ! <UNK> the carriage entered by the porta del popolo , turned to the left , and stopped at the ho tel d <UNK> .: 37.65
<S> it was not fatigue that stayed andrea here ; it was that he might form some resolution , adopt some plan .: 211.25
<S> but let us make haste , sir ; with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost . oh , this time , doctor , you shall not have to reproach me with weakness .: 30.90
<S> at the sound of that carriage i shuddered ; soon i heard steps on the staircase , which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don <UNK> .: 107.06
<S> it was a grain of a reddish color , which dissolved immediately .: 75.52
<S> wait whilst i light the lamp , said la carconte ; it is growing dark , and there may be some mistake . in fact , night had come on during this conversation , and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half hour .: 80.13
<S> this niece comes sometimes to see her uncle ; and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that i was , and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage . ah !: 69.31
<S> nevertheless , time passed on , and the rochellais did not surrender .: 52.85
<S> i devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes , till i knew them nearly by heart ; so that since i have been in prison , a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me .: 145.98
<S> in case i should be killed , said de guiche .: 18.76
<S> you were saying , signora , said albert , who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital , that the garrison of yanina , fatigued with long service had treated with the <UNK> kourchid , who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father ; it was then that ali tepelini after having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom he <UNK> great confidence resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself , and which he called <UNK> , or the refuge . and this officer , asked albert , do you remember his name , signora ? monte cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl , which was quite unperceived by albert .: 100.99
<S> are you going ? really , that is a good idea ! two hours have i been boring you to death with my company , and then you , with the greatest politeness , ask me if i am going .: 59.89
<S> one would think one was in the cave of ali baba .: 68.95
<S> bonacieux , eagerly , and looking at d artagnan with disquiet .: 37.14
<S> pardon me , and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace ? you are a brave young man , said buckingham , holding out his hand to d artagnan , who pressed it respectfully .: 25.90
<S> it appears to me you make dull jokes , my dear , said porthos .: 49.45
<S> he drew his sword entirely from the scabbard , and followed him , crying , turn , turn , master <UNK> , lest i strike you behind ! strike me ! said the other , turning on his heels , and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt .: 73.06
<S> three hours later , the man returned covered with dust , his errand was performed , and two minutes after , another man on foot , muffled in a mantle , opened the little door of the garden , which he closed after him .: 58.40
<S> the cardinal s guards ! cried aramis and porthos at the same time .: 14.57
<S> but how could you charge a nubian to purchase a house , and a mute to furnish it ? he will do everything wrong . undeceive yourself , monsieur , replied monte cristo ; i am quite sure , that , on the contrary , he will choose everything as i wish .: 45.36
<S> this could not , then , be a military ambuscade , as the ball was not of the regular <UNK> .: 79.62
<S> allow me to compliment you on your knowledge ; such learning is very rare among ladies . oh , i am aware of that , said madame de villefort ; but i have a passion for the occult sciences , which speak to the imagination like poetry , and are <UNK> to figures , like an algebraic <UNK> ; but go on , i beg of you ; what you say interests me to the greatest degree . <UNK> well , replied monte cristo suppose , then , that this poison was brucine , and you were to take a milligramme the first day , two <UNK> the second day , and so on .: 107.49
<S> a few moments passed ; a great noise was heard at the gate .: 19.94
<S> through the grating , however , dante s saw they were passing through the rue <UNK> , and by the rue saint laurent and the rue <UNK> , to the quay .: 54.68
<S> has he a lady with him ? jesus !: 74.79
<S> ruined ? said she .: 52.55
<S> he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread : cardinal , he said .: 60.52
<S> the result was that even if the king s troops remained quietly in their camp , it was evident that some day or other , buckingham , who only continued in the isle from obstinacy , would be obliged to raise the siege .: 110.82
<S> toward midday , lord de winter entered .: 49.94
<S> well , said he , friend , what matters the regiment of guards to us , and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance ?: 52.16
<S> for you must indeed be a great chemist , and the elixir you administered to my son , which recalled him to life almost instantaneously <UNK> oh , do not place any reliance on that , madame ; one drop of that elixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child , but three drops would have impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced most violent <UNK> ; six would have suspended his respiration , and caused <UNK> more serious than that in which he was ; ten would have destroyed him .: 230.08
<S> the sailors had again hoisted sail , and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves .: 143.29
<S> if you will only repeat that avowal now and then , i can endure anything . ah , maximilian , that is the very thing that makes you so bold , and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy , that i frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother , and her blind preference for her own child , or to be , as i now am , insensible to any pleasure save such as i find in these meetings , so fraught with danger to both . i will not admit that word , returned the young man ; it is at once cruel and unjust .: 94.00
<S> my ideas are never so clear as when i have had plenty of wine .: 62.28
<S> you have credit with your landlord , then ? asked porthos .: 32.41
<S> what wages are due to you ? oh , don t let us talk of that , m. morrel . yes , but we will talk of it . well , then , three months , said penelon .: 23.82
<S> gradually the reception room filled , and some of our old friends made their appearance we mean debray , cha teau renaud , and beauchamp , accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar , in literature , or the army , for m. de villefort moved in the first parisian circles , less owing to his social position than to his personal merit .: 141.67
<S> bazin , my friend , said aramis , you don t seem to be aware that i can see you in that mirror , and you forget that once for all i have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation .: 62.93
<S> all falsehood is a mask ; and however well made the mask may be , with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face .: 224.13
<S> they seem like poor fishermen , and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the indies . which means ? which means that my count of monte cristo is one of those fishermen .: 157.37
<S> dante s recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death , and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty .: 124.53
<S> if there were any danger to be apprehended on the road i am going , i would request you to accompany me ; but as there is none , remain where you are , finish your bottles , your game , and your letter .: 59.47
<S> in order that you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this letter , you will find enclosed an order for <UNK> francs , payable in florence , at signor <UNK> s ; also a letter of introduction to the count of monte cristo , on whom i give you a draft of 48,000 francs .: 82.76
<S> and then her thoughts , cleaving through space like a bird in the air , rested on cavalcanti .: 230.85
<S> at st. omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident , and ate a morsel from their hands on the stones of the street , after they departed again .: 119.42
<S> i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal . lower !: 102.77
<S> firstly , at a given signal , which shall be the words at last , you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the soldier nearest to you .: 166.92
<S> i do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of september ; it is ten years today since i saved your father s life , who wished to die . morrel seized the count s hand and kissed it ; the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him .: 32.43
<S> the lady was surpassingly beautiful , while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her .: 132.72
<S> sir , cried the groom , they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled half an hour . half an hour s rest is enough , replied the gascon .: 48.19
<S> charles , having proceeded with aramis as with athos , embraced them both .: 144.23
<S> as soon as the identity of my brother was proved , i was set at liberty .: 41.63
<S> the chevalier raised his head , saw the two young women , and without stopping , waved his hand in a friendly way to milady .: 41.07
<S> the name is wanting in this commission ; you can write it yourself . d artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it ; it was a lieutenant s commission in the musketeers .: 55.73
<S> then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a door , which after being opened to admit her was again fastened , and curiosity penetrated no farther .: 142.61
<S> gentlemen , continued the stranger , since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice , i must name myself .: 48.03
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> fire ! cried grimaud , unconsciously .: 46.70
<S> oh , i will find it , he cried ; you may pretend he is not here , but i will find him , though i dig forever ! monte cristo drew back in horror .: 48.38
<S> but with such men it is not the sword that should be employed ; it is the poniard . buckingham had left england the day before , sent as ambassador to spain , to demand the hand of the <UNK> for king charles i. , who was then only prince of wales .: 99.39
<S> he did not move at the sound of the door , and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an <UNK> glare the sombre walls of his cell ; then , raising his head , he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present .: 68.79
<S> it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber , for without it he would have been unable , perhaps , to reach the vessel certainly to return to shore , should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention .: 143.16
<S> opposite the tower of london he found the vessel that had been named to him , delivered his letter to the captain , who after having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to sail .: 77.11
<S> my good , my brave guitant , whatsoever command i may give you in that language in french whatever i may order you to do , will you not perform it ? certainly .: 111.01
<S> come , come , said monte cristo , confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson french .: 49.75
<S> the coadjutor , whose eyes devoured her slightest movements , seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it , returned to the window and waved it in his hand .: 81.77
<S> i feel the blood flowing towards my brain .: 74.13
<S> when i say i want , i mean the queen wants them .: 62.10
<S> with one spring he flew from the chamber of milady into that of the maid , and quick as lightning , he <UNK> to the door , and placed all his weight against it , while kitty pushed the bolts .: 87.22
<S> you are very fortunate to have lost , believe me , my dear d artagnan .: 15.30
<S> yes .: 18.24
<S> he soon saw that the vessel , with the wind dead ahead , was <UNK> between the cha teau d if and the tower of <UNK> .: 102.34
<S> at the moment he entered the vestibule , another man was entering likewise , dusty , out of breath , leaving at the gate a post horse , which , on reaching the palace , tumbled on his <UNK> .: 94.45
<S> finally he promised that he would leave her mistress s presence at an early hour that evening , and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the maid .: 74.27
<S> from the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants , he had been enamoured of teresa , and had sworn she should be his .: 40.10
<S> he was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class , when planchet approached and said : i will lay a wager , your honor , that you and i are thinking of the same thing . i doubt it , planchet , replied d artagnan , but what are you thinking of ? i am thinking , sir , of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested . always cautious , planchet . tis instinct , your honor . well , what does your instinct tell you now ? sir , my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose ; and i was reflecting on what my instinct had told me , in the darkest corner of the stable , when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men , came in . ah ah ! said d artagnan , planchet s recital agreeing with his own observations .: 81.10
<S> many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run , first men , then groups , and then a crowd of people ; hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it ; but friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage .: 125.72
<S> what do you intend doing ? valentine held down her head ; she was overwhelmed .: 34.74
<S> i have heard that she met with a strange adventure in i don t know what village , with i don t know what cure , of whom she asked hospitality and who , having but one chamber , and taking her for a cavalier , offered to share it with her .: 96.49
<S> he brought him also the amount of his wages , which captain gaumard had not dared to apply for .: 135.60
<S> it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such <UNK> pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her ; besides , the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested end useless injury is repugnant to every mind .: 499.90

<S> good natured , confiding , and <UNK> as i had been , i became revengeful , cunning , and wicked , or rather , immovable as fate .: 138.58
<S> you will say , then , to my good and faithful parisians , continued anne , with a smile , the expression of which did not deceive d artagnan , that you have seen the king in bed , asleep , and the queen also ready to retire . i shall tell them , madame , and those who accompany me will say the same thing ; but but what ? asked anne of austria .: 38.26

<S> i can not stop a moment ; i must start for paris again immediately . what ?: 36.74
<S> an event took place in the church of st. louis au marais .: 207.06
<S> yes and no .: 51.47

<S> <UNK> ! said the same sharp and imperative voice .: 210.08
<S> but don t fancy that i am going to take you on your bare word .: 49.39
<S> faith , no , thank heaven ! replied raoul ; but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering ? i fear we arrived too late .: 69.99
<S> then i admit my patience failed me ; i drew my sword in my turn , and as he came back to the charge , i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me , he let it pass through his body .: 48.22

<S> toward midnight charles heard a great noise beneath his window .: 133.27

<S> aramis returned home , and athos and d artagnan busied themselves about <UNK> the sapphire .: 145.33
<S> he was a man about twenty two or twenty three years old , but who appeared much older from <UNK> exercises .: 86.08
<S> at this athos would smile , with his charming , melancholy smile , which so became his noble countenance , and porthos would drink , swearing that aramis would never be anything but a village cure .: 136.54
<S> besides we can be on our guard ; let us take arms , let planchet post himself behind us with his carbine . planchet is a frondeur , answered d artagnan .: 86.22
<S> on your return you were received by an august personage , and i perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you . d artagnan placed his hand upon the queen s diamond , which he wore , and quickly turned the stone inward ; but it was too late .: 62.77
<S> the night was one of feverish distraction , and in its progress visions , good and evil , passed through dante s mind .: 144.94
<S> this idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it , she implored the captain to put her on shore ; but the captain , eager to escape from his false position placed between french and english cruisers , like the <UNK> between the <UNK> and the birds was in great haste to regain england , and positively refused to obey what he took for a woman s caprice , promising his passenger , who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal , to land her , if the sea and the french permitted him , at one of the ports of brittany , either at lorient or brest .: 189.39
<S> while all the proceedings relative to the <UNK> of the marriage contract were being carried on at the house of m. de villefort , monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf , who , in order to lose no time in responding to m. danglars wishes , and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society , donned his uniform of lieutenant general , which he ornamented with all his crosses , and thus attired , ordered his finest horses and drove to the rue de la chausse e d antin .: 56.55

<S> when you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and <UNK> sense of coming danger , i placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service , asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you ; and have i ever since , by word or look , given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you ?: 182.26
<S> the chancellor entered , half smiling , half blushing .: 105.21
<S> the next day , on awaking , the count perceived raoul by his bedside .: 37.12
<S> what s the matter ? asked aramis .: 6.44
<S> then new <UNK> to the people , then a constitution , then liberty .: 408.29
<S> what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt ? yes , the written order , said porthos , who now began to comprehend what d artagnan was aiming at , we ask only for that . however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence , he understood the reasons d artagnan had given him ; besides , completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four frenchmen , all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom .: 108.32
<S> i knew very well that he was incapable of defending me ; but as he could serve us in other ways , i wished to inform him . of what ? oh , that is not my secret ; i must not , therefore , tell you . besides , said d artagnan , pardon me , madame , if , guardsman as i am , i remind you of prudence besides , i believe we are not here in a very proper place for <UNK> <UNK> .: 50.97
<S> the queen had written , the keeper of the prison at saint germain will set councillor broussel at liberty ; and she had signed it .: 68.23

<S> a quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion , having been put in the right road , passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the barrie re saint martin .: 49.61
<S> danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road , and perceived monuments of a singular form , and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related , and comparing them with his own situation , he felt sure that he must be on the appian way .: 111.92
<S> there is no knight <UNK> to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the fair lady i detain a prisoner ; but i have judges quite ready who will quickly dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide , a <UNK> , into the bed of lord de winter , my brother .: 136.22
<S> at ten o clock milady began to appear restless .: 39.76
<S> i am ready , said he .: 8.28

<S> yes , <UNK> ; that is to say , highway robbers . at them ! cried raoul .: 94.21
<S> you shall soon have something to drink ; i give you my word . if there is any left , grumbled the jeering voice of athos .: 93.47
<S> the avenger .: 50.91
<S> he was a simple looking lawyer s clerk , elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial <UNK> .: 289.45
<S> villefort is no longer at marseilles ; he is now at <UNK> . i am no longer surprised at my detention , murmured dante s , since my only protector is removed . had m. de villefort any cause of personal dislike to you ? none ; on the contrary , he was very kind to me . i can , then , rely on the notes he has left concerning you ? entirely . that is well ; wait patiently , then . dante s fell on his knees , and prayed earnestly .: 67.40
<S> such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate , and demanded if it was not at no .: 69.70
<S> the room was <UNK> , comfortably furnished .: 279.23
<S> sleep well your last night as citizen . i am to be a soldier then ? said the young man .: 73.79
<S> what he ? asked athos .: 12.75
<S> my good fellow , you ll find the word in saint simon . but the thing itself is at m. de villefort s ; but let s get back to the subject . talking of that , said debray , madame was making inquiries about that house , which for the last three months has been hung with black . who is madame ? asked cha teau renaud .: 68.91
<S> he struggled against his thirst till his tongue <UNK> to the roof of his mouth ; then , no longer able to resist , he called out .: 103.56
<S> i recollect now ; it was a very serious charge . how so ? you know that when he left here he was taken to the palais de justice . well ? i made my report to the authorities at paris , and a week after he was carried off . carried off ! said morrel .: 53.70
<S> this lackey was my compatriot ; and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between us .: 268.65
<S> the image of devastation and death , as the ancient poet says , reigned as over a field of battle . of fifty large sausages , suspended from the <UNK> , scarcely ten remained .: 349.73

<S> his zeal had procured him <UNK> , and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba . then , said monte cristo you went to him ? monsieur , i said , my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of ni mes , i know not by whom , but it is your duty to find out .: 43.27
<S> it matters little .: 257.00
<S> who the beggar was that i killed . ah !: 142.66
<S> and yet , instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion , laughter and jests arose from the crowd .: 123.12
<S> the young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of <UNK> and bethune .: 130.17
<S> yes , if it isn t contrary to the rules . oh , no , said the gardener ; not in the least , since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying . i have been told , said the count , that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat . that is true , sir , and that is what i like best , said the man , smiling .: 34.37
<S> but this confession concerns me only .: 95.59
<S> you were speaking of the champs e lyse es just now , worthy foster father . well ? well , in the champs e lyse es there resides a very rich gentleman . at whose house you robbed and murdered , did you not ? i believe i did . the count of monte cristo ? tis you who have named him , as m. <UNK> says .: 96.47
<S> a moment s silence ensued and then , in a full , sonorous voice , the king exclaimed : remember ! he had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow .: 101.97
<S> the minutes passed ; madame de villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral <UNK> over the head of valentine .: 81.08
<S> the lease was drawn up for three , six , or nine years by the new tenant , who , according to the rule of the proprietor , paid six months in advance .: 67.01
<S> then , with his knife , he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood ; it was thus that <UNK> , the famous sculptor , had commenced .: 92.18
<S> why did you so <UNK> restore me the handkerchief ? why did you so <UNK> let it fall ? i have said , monsieur , and i repeat , that the handkerchief did not fall from my pocket . and thereby you have lied twice , monsieur , for i saw it fall . ah , you take it with that tone , do you , master gascon ?: 95.20
<S> danglars had , however , protested against showing himself in a ministerial box , declaring that his political principles , and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself ; the baroness had , therefore , despatched a note to lucien debray , bidding him call for them , it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with euge nie to the opera .: 155.28
<S> he began by moving his bed , and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall , penetrate the moist cement , and displace a stone .: 105.92
<S> to this dumb language , which was so unintelligible to others , she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance , and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the <UNK> girl and the helpless invalid , whose body could scarcely be called a living one , but who , nevertheless , possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration , united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses .: 240.70
<S> we are now on the sea , at night , without any pilot , in a frail bark ; should a blast of wind upset the boat we are lost . mousqueton heaved a deep sigh .: 142.82
<S> i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth .: 249.26
<S> and yet he reckoned , and with reason , on milady .: 73.54
<S> the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness , then , turning towards the notary , he significantly winked his eye in token of <UNK> .: 33.43
<S> the lady with the red cushion produced a great effect for she was very handsome upon the lady with the black hood , who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded ; a great effect upon porthos , who thought her much <UNK> than the lady with the black hood ; a great effect upon d artagnan , who recognized in her the lady of meung , of calais , and of dover , whom his persecutor , the man with the scar , had saluted by the name of milady .: 100.18
<S> i confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber , which is the handsomest in the ho tel , and to be satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor ; but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress , who was one of the greatest ladies in the court , i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage .: 75.67
<S> i warn you , however , his services will cost you something .: 42.85
<S> monte cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful , and so full of affectionate admiration , that she turned back and grasped his hand ; at the same time she seized that of her son , and joined them together .: 45.88
<S> come , tell me ! she had seduced and ruined my brother , a priest .: 76.86
<S> there , said he , demand thy child of carlini ; he will tell thee what has become of her ; and he returned to his companions .: 44.83
<S> i find that i have not been mistaken , and i thank you that there is still one man in france of whom may be said , without disappointment , what i have said of you . that s well said , cried the king , who had heard all these compliments through the open door ; only tell him , tre ville , since he wishes to be considered your friend , that i also wish to be one of his , but he <UNK> me ; that it is nearly three years since i have seen him , and that i never do see him unless i send for him .: 42.11
<S> m. de tre ville never jested in matters relating to discipline .: 216.59
<S> the duke meanwhile recovered his self control .: 133.27
<S> the felucca is <UNK> , said d artagnan .: 30.82
<S> for mercy s sake , then , what would you call robespierre ?: 35.28
<S> morrel fell back in his chair , his eyes fixed on the clock ; there were seven minutes left , that was all .: 36.74
<S> you seem a worthy young man ; i will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation .: 69.77
<S> raoul trembled , lest he should laugh among the rest at madame de chevreuse , for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy , but either instinctively , or from affection for the duchess , he said everything in her favor .: 131.21
<S> the carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn , to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of <UNK> , an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter , and had gained for the place the appellation of the little versailles .: 165.30
<S> besides , his probity was irreproachable , in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with their religion and their consciences , lovers with the rigorous delicacy of our <UNK> , and the poor with god s seventh <UNK> .: 337.60
<S> stay here , if you like , but i warn you twill be rather too warm presently . but we can not swim to the shore . the longboat is yonder , <UNK> to the felucca .: 146.81
<S> valentine and the old man heard this conversation , and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look .: 77.00
<S> i have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was concerned in the abduction of madame bonacieux . yes , i understand now : to find one woman , you court another .: 134.32
<S> but my mother no , not my mother ; i mistake my father intends giving a ball . a ball at this season ? summer balls are fashionable . if they were not , the countess has only to wish it , and they would become so . you are right ; you know they are select affairs ; those who remain in paris in july must be true parisians .: 171.99
<S> help help help ! hush !: 141.15
<S> finally , as the hour for her interview with the count approached , milady had everything about her darkened , and ordered kitty to return to her own chamber , and introduce de wardes whenever he presented himself .: 135.95
<S> close to the hedge the steps stopped .: 108.42
<S> we are alone , sir , said buckingham ; speak ! my lord , said felton , the baron de winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named charlotte backson . yes , sir ; and i answered him , to bring or send me that order and i would sign it . here it is , my lord . give it to me , said the duke .: 45.88
<S> really , said she , i believe you now begin to hesitate . no , i do not hesitate ; but i really pity this poor comte de wardes , since you have ceased to love him .: 33.24
<S> is m. de saint me ran with you ? m .: 18.01
<S> the truth , madame , said mazarin , placing a pen and a paper before her , you must ; then he added : sign , anne , i implore you i command you . the queen fell into a chair , took the pen and signed .: 42.67
<S> the standard . very well ; in half an hour we shall be on board . and the friends , spurring on their horses , rode to the hotel , the arms of england . what do you say of that young man ? asked d artagnan , as they hurried along .: 39.25
<S> sometimes we don t go to bed at all ! well , what of that ? why , he would be annoyed if i did not play with him . does he play well ? i have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles , laughing all the while till the tears rolled down . bring him with you , then . but how about our prisoners ? let your servants guard them . yes , and give them a chance of escaping , said d artagnan .: 62.02
<S> it was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at la rochelle ; that is to say , at the other end of france .: 28.66
<S> the devil ! said d artagnan to himself .: 5.03
<S> and has this man displayed a friendship for you , albert ? she asked with a nervous shudder .: 60.42
<S> the black horses of the musketeers , their martial carriage , with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier , would have betrayed the most strict incognito .: 163.18
<S> at last d avrigny slowly uttered these words : she is still alive ! still ? cried villefort ; oh , doctor , what a dreadful word is that . yes , said the physician , i repeat it ; she is still alive , and i am astonished at it . but is she safe ? asked the father .: 45.02
<S> the four friends saw all this not a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them .: 63.55
<S> in matters of speculation , however , though man proposes , yet money disposes . from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth , and the purchaser of the kitchen garden , having paid a high price for it , and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss , yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him , not only for his past outlay , but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition , contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market gardeners , at a yearly <UNK> of 500 francs .: 298.61
<S> of bethune ! not been there , i would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of it , or even after thinking of it .: 103.60
<S> ah ! said aramis , but you forget the officer . d artagnan grew pale with rage .: 30.35
<S> i have not said good morning to you , monsieur d artagnan , he said ; nevertheless , i have remarked you .: 30.17
<S> tony , is your master sleeping ? said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment , which served as a kind of ante room .: 72.55
<S> i always said that this cadet from gascony was a well of wisdom , murmured athos ; and the travelers continued their route .: 99.73
<S> i confess , observed monte cristo , that i have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful . oh , said morcerf , this repugnance , if repugnance it may be called , is not all on my side . whence can it arise , then ?: 74.07
<S> he went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room , where he summoned bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over monsieur de beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive .: 77.63
<S> he placed the casket on the table ; then opening it took out a little golden box , the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring .: 84.84
<S> he asked what was going on .: 23.32
<S> you shall shut the door that you may be certain i contemplate no injury to you !: 129.00
<S> the count , in taking leave of him , said something in a low voice , to which he answered , willingly , count ; i accept . the count returned to young morcerf .: 50.04
<S> ah , replied he , sighing , that is not very surprising ; i have been more than a year absent from paris , and my clothes are of a most <UNK> cut ; the count takes me for a provincial .: 73.30
<S> no ; i am sorry to tell you he is perfectly well . so much the worse , said porthos .: 13.58
<S> it is extraordinary , he said , when the door was closed behind him , how easily these husbands , whom we ridicule , gain an advantage over us . <UNK> lucien having left , danglars took his place on the sofa , closed the open book , and placing himself in a dreadfully <UNK> attitude , he began playing with the dog ; but the animal , not liking him as well as debray , and attempting to bite him , danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room .: 87.09
<S> winter , give the necessary orders . winter then left the tent ; in the meantime the king finished his toilet .: 147.78
<S> at length i heard the well known noise of the door , which opened and shut ; i heard , notwithstanding the <UNK> of the carpet , a step which made the floor creak ; i saw , notwithstanding the darkness , a shadow which approached my bed . haste !: 111.62
<S> my dear bazin , said d artagnan , i am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church ! sir , replied bazin , i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause . so far well , said aramis ; we are dying of hunger .: 71.31
<S> i am anxious to know the state of your health . he calls that a language !: 56.96
<S> since god himself dictated those words to his prophet , why should i seek to make myself better than god ? edmond , continued merce de s , with her arms extended towards the count , since i first knew you , i have adored your name , have respected your memory .: 92.24
<S> when i hear misfortunes named , madame , he said , i have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own , and then i can not help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind .: 129.90
<S> all that is in this grotto , my friend , my house in the champs e lyse es , and my cha teau at tre port , are the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dante s upon the son of his old master , morrel .: 63.37
<S> thus they applied very <UNK> to the salutations , <UNK> , and jokes of their companions .: 226.87

<S> well , well , dandre , said louis xviii. , blacas is not yet convinced ; let us proceed , therefore , to the usurper s conversion . the minister of police bowed .: 55.92
<S> my dear albert , said debray , rising , it is half past two .: 17.47
<S> gladly availing himself of this opportunity , the coachman leaped from his box ; but ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse , and held them in his iron grasp , till the beast , <UNK> with pain , sunk beside his companion .: 172.82
<S> but what ails you , father ?: 17.57
<S> the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler , and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene .: 171.08
<S> it is the declaration of cardinal spada , and the will so long sought for , replied edmond , still incredulous .: 76.08
<S> his forced politeness sat <UNK> upon him , and approached almost to impertinence .: 596.08
<S> at his first coming he had not said a word of love to merce de s ; at the second he reminded her that he loved her .: 42.59
<S> franz untied it , and in the midst of the most profound silence read : <UNK> extract of the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques , held february 5th , 1815 . franz stopped .: 91.11
<S> oh no , it is as simple as possible , replied monte cristo .: 20.26
<S> they advanced to the plain .: 39.28
<S> i believed i had a right to endeavor to find her .: 30.27
<S> the count advanced , accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel .: 29.93
<S> i live , as it were , between two graves .: 73.64
<S> by the way , added he in a low tone , take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes . the doctor , without shaking hands with villefort , without adding a word to what he had said , went out , amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household .: 58.42
<S> mousqueton , therefore , was soon provided with tools and he began his task .: 164.22
<S> who said valentine was dead ? the two men turned round , and saw morrel standing at the door , pale and terror stricken .: 54.19
<S> at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks , consciousness returned to the dull , open eyeballs , a faint sigh issued from the lips , and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move .: 158.36
<S> no , count , he replied , i am the only victim in this case .: 21.31
<S> help ! cried d artagnan ; stop my horse has the <UNK> . in an instant the horse s eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam .: 86.57
<S> that happened , as i told you , in 1829 .: 47.21
<S> your song is as dismal as a de <UNK> ; and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here , we must hear such things as these , no mortal can hold out . silence ! then exclaimed another stern voice which milady recognized as that of felton .: 169.50
<S> in which m. se guier , keeper of the seals , looks more than once for the bell chapter <UNK> .: 251.47
<S> i go out ? he said .: 19.12
<S> well , said caderousse , why , what a lie he told !: 70.97
<S> danglars was balancing his monthly accounts , and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor .: 117.05
<S> then , instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him , he opened the drawer of his desk , touched a spring , and drew out a parcel of cherished <UNK> , amongst which he had carefully arranged , in characters only known to himself , the names of all those who , either in his political career , in money matters , at the bar , or in his mysterious love affairs , had become his enemies .: 110.51
<S> you are come too late you are come to see me die .: 40.22
<S> perhaps if i employed my strength against women i might perchance find them weaker than myself , and consequently conquer them ; but it is with men that i struggle , and i am but a woman to them .: 168.77
<S> a <UNK> . yes , i think i received a flower pot upon my head . <UNK> ! said d artagnan .: 77.02
<S> only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour ; i do not like to be kept waiting . pistols , then , at eight o clock , in the bois de vincennes , said beauchamp , quite disconcerted , not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant <UNK> or a supernatural being .: 90.56
<S> athos did not leave his chamber ; he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip himself .: 28.89
<S> on a sudden she stepped , or rather bounded , with outstretched arms , towards the table .: 95.94
<S> had he remained with you , his life must have become a hateful burden , nor would he have participated in your griefs .: 162.73
<S> oh , that s nothing !: 14.67
<S> planchet !: 40.18
<S> captivity : the third day felton had fallen ; but there was still another step to be taken .: 53.66
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required .: 68.21
<S> matrimonial projects the day following this scene , at the hour debray usually chose to pay a visit to madame danglars on his way to his office , his coupe did not appear .: 112.31
<S> wait an instant , my friend , and you shall be satisfied .: 20.32
<S> she ground her teeth ; she was of the color of ashes .: 110.26
<S> i will give you a paper which you must not part with on any account , and which you will deliver into the proper hands . and whither am i to go ? to london . i go to london ?: 70.99
<S> his excellency the count of monte cristo had , he said , given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their <UNK> orders all day , and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion . they resolved to profit by the count s courtesy , and ordered the horses to be harnessed , while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on , and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous <UNK> they had sustained .: 132.52
<S> you will come off splendidly at those two exercises ; but pass the pen over to monsieur abbe .: 204.47
<S> yes , said he , i made a vow , to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if i were saved in a moment of danger ; but today the vow expires . now what are we to do with you ? said the captain .: 70.19
<S> the <UNK> , the sang <UNK> , the <UNK> <UNK> les <UNK> , crossed one another in the air .: 558.21
<S> there is , however , a proverb current in france relating to water which is quiet . continue , said the queen .: 151.32
<S> give me your horse , porthos .: 22.97
<S> that he was living on a small estate but where ?: 228.15
<S> then i renewed the search .: 78.17
<S> d artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword .: 24.62
<S> come , said d artagnan to raoul , seeing that athos wished to be alone , come , let us take a turn in the fencing gallery ; that will amuse you . and they both went into a low room where there were foils , gloves , masks , <UNK> , and all the <UNK> for a fencing match .: 74.48
<S> monsieur le comte , said the duchess , giving him a letter , here is what i promised you ; our young friend will be extremely well received . madame , he is very happy in owing any obligation to you . you have no reason to envy him on that score , for i owe to you the pleasure of knowing him , replied the witty woman , with a smile which recalled marie michon to aramis and to athos .: 52.60
<S> the baroness ascended the steps ; she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to <UNK> her own , and still guided by the valet de chambre , who never lost sight of her for an instant , she was introduced to the magistrate s study .: 55.32
<S> on the contrary , i take you to be a worthy and accomplished gentleman .: 37.95
<S> pray let me know who you really are ? the stranger smiled a melancholy smile .: 55.01
<S> i make no account of the harm mordaunt can do ! cried d artagnan .: 85.09
<S> for the present he had no anxiety .: 39.85
<S> suppose a <UNK> should pass ? and he blew out the light .: 135.50
<S> i will not sign this order !: 32.55
<S> four hundred , at a pistole each , four hundred pistoles . yes , interposed porthos , four hundred pistoles ; but who is to make four hundred pistoles ? a pistole is not enough , said d artagnan , tis worth a louis . what is worth a louis ? four hundred , at a louis each , make four hundred louis . four hundred ? said porthos .: 62.97
<S> oh , the devil ! said porthos , i am sorry for that ; it would have been one language more . when i speak of the pure parliament , resumed the host , i mean the one which colonel bridge has <UNK> . ah !: 63.85
<S> the prince de marsillac my old friend will recommend our young friend to madame de longueville , who will give him a letter to her brother , the prince , who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes immediately . well , that will do charmingly , said the count ; but may i beg that the greatest haste may be made , for i have reasons for wishing the vicomte not to sleep longer than to morrow night in paris ! do you wish it known that you are interested about him , monsieur le comte ? better for him in future that he should be supposed never to have seen me . oh , sir ! cried raoul .: 67.96
<S> strength and sagacity .: 50.58
<S> his pallor was so peculiar , that it seemed to <UNK> to one who had been long <UNK> , and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life .: 163.33
<S> you are perhaps a <UNK> <UNK> ? my dear friend , if i am , you must not laugh at me for being so .: 76.20
<S> daughter of a prince , i restore to you the riches and name of your father . hayde e became pale , and lifting her transparent hands to heaven , exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears , then you leave me , my lord ? hayde e , hayde e , you are young and beautiful ; forget even my name , and be happy . it is well , said hayde e ; your order shall be executed , my lord ; i will forget even your name , and be happy . and she stepped back to retire .: 52.01
<S> but , cried felton , that is a fleur de lis which i see there . and therein consisted the infamy , replied milady .: 97.32
<S> all noise in the streets had ceased , and the silence was frightful .: 58.21
<S> why , what has happened to you ? are you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage ? asked monte cristo , in the same tone that louis xiv .: 19.60
<S> then the diamond is safe ? said he , timidly .: 30.37
<S> ah , said valentine , the thing you desire begins with the letter n ; it is with n that we have to do , then .: 69.64
<S> however , i m glad not to fight them until to morrow .: 69.25
<S> bonacieux ; let us fly !: 32.51
<S> how ghastly pale he is ! oh , he is always as colorless as you now see him , said franz .: 91.70
<S> d artagnan could not help perceiving that something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and said , well , monsieur planchet , what is the matter with us now ? don t you think , monsieur , that woods are like churches ? how so , planchet ? because we dare not speak aloud in one or the other . but why did you not dare to speak aloud , planchet because you are afraid ? afraid of being heard ?: 58.67
<S> d artagnan , as he crossed the pont neuf , congratulated himself on having found planchet again , for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him ; nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards , a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced , at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party .: 143.79
<S> do you think so ?: 9.77
<S> well , yes , and i had good reason to be so , replied cha teau renaud .: 22.31
<S> in fact , it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far .: 110.12
<S> the carriage , however , passed on .: 19.23
<S> but as villefort saw his father but seldom , and then only when absolutely obliged , and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there , all the old man s happiness was centred in his granddaughter .: 121.65
<S> it is incredible !: 22.05
<S> the regiments , the <UNK> , and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct .: 157.96
<S> at that moment he thought of the trees , upon whose leaves the light still shone ; and as one of them drooped over the road , he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pavilion .: 59.62
<S> she remembered that she had a son , said he ; and i forgot i had a daughter . then , shaking his head sorrowfully , poor hayde e , said he ; she wished to see me , to speak to me ; she has feared or guessed something .: 37.33
<S> perhaps i turned pale and trembled , but certainly i smiled ; and five minutes after i left , without having heard one word that had passed . poor maximilian ! murmured valentine .: 77.95
<S> captivity : the fifth day milady had however achieved a half triumph , and success doubled her forces .: 300.50
<S> porthos opened his mouth to reply ; d artagnan made him a sign , and his mouth , remaining silent , gradually closed .: 42.54
<S> he tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins ; he had escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything .: 88.81
<S> in five minutes he had arrived at the place , where the guards joined him , coming up one by one .: 35.76
<S> the latter , his heart palpitating more than ever , entered the courtyard without dismounting .: 117.60
<S> the president looked at his auditors .: 27.20
<S> milady , that woman so courageous and firm , shivered in spite of herself .: 81.94
<S> now , said the owner to his wife and daughter , leave me ; i wish to speak with this gentleman . <UNK> and he glanced towards the clerk of thomson french , who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene , in which he had taken no part , except the few words we have mentioned .: 49.58
<S> but by some strange play of emotion , in proportion as the proofs that faria , had not been deceived became stronger , so did his heart give way , and a feeling of discouragement stole over him .: 144.87
<S> a horse ! he cried ; i have found a horse ! and i , likewise , said athos .: 20.79
<S> then he went out .: 10.35
<S> ah , ha , whispered monte cristo with a smile of disappointment , he is only a thief . but the man in the dark could not find the right key .: 42.19
<S> mademoiselle d armilly , whom they then perceived through the open doorway , formed with euge nie one of the <UNK> <UNK> of which the germans are so fond .: 147.63
<S> luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the roman peasant at holiday time .: 322.49
<S> my lord , continued felton , becoming more excited as he spoke , my lord , beware !: 36.61
<S> well , bazin , said d artagnan , since you do not know where your master lives , let us speak of it no more ; let us part good friends .: 30.64
<S> the blood had mounted to the head of d artagnan , and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against athos , porthos , and aramis .: 39.62
<S> the colosseum franz had so managed his route , that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin , so that no preliminary impression interfered to <UNK> the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire .: 331.73
<S> he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note , placed in a <UNK> against his name : edmond dante s .: 142.87
<S> had dante s found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale .: 106.56
<S> donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations .: 65.39
<S> yet , on his arrival , morrel did not utter a complaint , or say one harsh word .: 120.48
<S> d artagnan smiled .: 9.13
<S> alas ! said felton , looking at those beautiful hands , and shaking his head sorrowfully .: 23.65
<S> embrace porthos from aramis and myself .: 167.57
<S> could you let me hire a horse of you ? an innkeeper has always a horse to let , whether it be good or bad .: 160.30
<S> it was the man he called his phantom ; it was his stranger of meung , of the rue des fossoyeurs and of arras .: 46.98
<S> and you what will you become ?: 33.84
<S> why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me ?: 69.35
<S> as he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy , d artagnan and aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him .: 69.88
<S> aramis , confiding in the address of bazin , made a pompous eulogium on his <UNK> .: 203.29
<S> a surgeon !: 39.52
<S> i have the purse still by me a large one , made of red silk . and , asked the abbe , is m. morrel still alive ? yes , replied caderousse .: 69.04
<S> you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight , telling the world you are abandoned , and relating the details of this <UNK> to your best friends , who will soon spread the report .: 104.79
<S> at them ! echoed de guiche .: 127.40
<S> the windows on the ground floor , according to a custom in provincial <UNK> , were barred , so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison .: 94.33
<S> they passed the barrier without accident .: 36.13
<S> it is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in me .: 23.10
<S> grimaud was left alone with the executioner , who in a few moments opened his eyes .: 33.93
<S> have i friends ?: 108.50
<S> athos and aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the duc de beaufort .: 43.79
<S> yes ; read it . <UNK> morrel opened the letter , and read : my dear maximilian , there is a felucca for you at anchor .: 57.41
<S> to no class of persons is the presentation of a <UNK> opera box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire , who still <UNK> economy while boasting of carrying a king s ransom in his waistcoat pocket .: 685.18
<S> what do you mean ?: 5.22
<S> now , i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request , but say on . but , since you go out with hayde e , and sometimes even take her to the opera well ? i think i may venture to ask you this favor . you may venture to ask me anything . well then , my dear count , present me to your princess . i will do so ; but on two conditions . i accept them at once . the first is , that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview . very well , said albert , extending his hand ; i swear i will not . the second is , that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers . i give you my oath that i will not . enough , viscount ; you will remember those two vows , will you not ?: 61.43
<S> there are as many <UNK> of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity ; and i will say further the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the <UNK> to <UNK> for love or desires for vengeance . but , sir , remarked the young woman , these eastern societies , in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence , are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land .: 167.55
<S> the scotchman .: 46.19
<S> milady uttered a deep , inward shriek , and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which <UNK> for a spring .: 93.41
<S> has the daughter of ali tepelini spoken the truth ? said the president .: 45.88
<S> i am not forgotten .: 23.23
<S> what are you about ? said d artagnan .: 7.37
<S> you know , maximilian , grandpapa once thought of leaving this house , and taking an apartment away from m. de villefort s. yes , said maximilian , i recollect the project , of which i highly approved . well , said valentine , you may approve again , for grandpapa is again thinking of it . bravo , said maximilian .: 70.78
<S> what advantage should i have over you , if knowing your secret i were to tell you mine ? danglars bit his lips .: 99.41
<S> the other three were occupied in opening an enormous <UNK> of <UNK> wine ; these were the lackeys of these gentlemen .: 134.93
<S> neither of them had returned .: 60.47
<S> the leader closed the window , came out an instant after by the door , and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage .: 39.09
<S> kill the fellow , and rejoin us as soon as you can . all three remounted their horses , and set out at a good pace , while porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing <UNK> .: 131.54
<S> bravo , monsieur grimaud ! said athos ; and now take this .: 41.97
<S> this time maximilian was the first to arrive .: 26.89
<S> admirable ! said d artagnan .: 8.81
<S> d artagnan then looked around attentively .: 21.48
<S> have you not perceived it ? it may be ; but you know the more hearts are worth the capture , the more difficult they are to be won . oh , difficulties do not affright me , said d artagnan .: 68.41
<S> on the contrary , i think they are poor , sir . they are friends of yours , then ? yes , sir , exclaimed mordaunt , they are friends , dear friends of mine , and i would lay down my life for them . very well , mordaunt , exclaimed cromwell , pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more ; i will give them to you ; i will not even ask who they are ; do as you like with them . thank you , sir ! exclaimed mordaunt , thank you ; my life is always at your service , and should i lose it i should still owe you something ; thank you ; you have indeed repaid me <UNK> for my services . he threw himself at the feet of cromwell , and in spite of the efforts of the puritan general , who did not like this almost kingly homage , he took his hand and kissed it .: 47.84
<S> i recollect . then i paid the host six . what a brute of a host !: 221.35
<S> then he paused .: 19.88
<S> if you were a duchess , a marchioness , or a countess , it would be quite a different thing ; it would be unpardonable . the procurator s wife was piqued .: 40.16
<S> i will shape it out for you with my knife . and he took the gibbet and shaped it out as <UNK> as possible .: 107.73
<S> he will see us if we go out . then you must come up into my room . ah , said mme .: 27.93
<S> he related to athos all that had passed , except the letter to m. de wardes .: 42.18
<S> he knew this was the last struggle .: 34.46
<S> it is well , said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words ; you wish it you are inflexible .: 56.34
<S> behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers .: 118.09
<S> no , no , i wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me , my dear viscount ; it is tiresome to be always acting manfred .: 58.57
<S> on her left shoulder sparkled the diamond studs , on a bow of the same color as the plumes and the petticoat .: 99.26
<S> mother , he said , turning towards merce de s , this is m. debray , secretary of the minister for the interior , once a friend of mine . how once ? stammered debray ; what do you mean ? i say so , m. debray , because i have no friends now , and i ought not to have any .: 32.79
<S> happiness comes to meet him , does it not , monsieur bonacieux ? bonacieux became as pale as death , and <UNK> a ghastly smile .: 96.76
<S> advise me what i had better do . emmanuel , returned my sister , the house of morrel can only be carried on by a morrel .: 106.07
<S> the king wishes to get a sleep . one of the two , who was standing up , was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall , whilst the other , kneeling beside him , was collecting the pieces of stone .: 108.80
<S> for peppino ! cried andrea , who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged .: 67.97
<S> she was somewhat beautiful , and exquisitely formed a little fairy like figure , with large curls falling on her neck , which was rather too long , as perugino sometimes makes his virgins , and her eyes dull from fatigue .: 177.81
<S> patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by france ; <UNK> , however , were not meat and drink , and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent .: 202.44
<S> uncle and nephew .: 140.48
<S> the judges were looking for a new <UNK> from the benches .: 96.26
<S> it is a color very well known in botany , but till the present time very rare among horses . there are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh at the master , cried the young <UNK> of the furious tre ville .: 143.89
<S> he set out , and on the saturday evening reached the place de la <UNK> by the mail coach .: 168.77
<S> answer me ! on what i could get . you lie , repeated the abbe a third time , with a still more imperative tone .: 93.96
<S> do you think they will grant it ? without doubt . how many are they ? four , and the two bandits make six . just our number , so that if they prove troublesome , we shall be able to hold them in check ; so , for the last time , steer to monte cristo . yes , but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions . by all means , be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulysses ; i do more than permit , i <UNK> you . silence , then ! said gaetano .: 83.11
<S> franz , albert , and the count continued to descend the corso .: 31.65
<S> it was too warm in the room , was it not , count ? she asked .: 29.04
<S> listen , said he to him .: 11.79
<S> monsieur de <UNK> , lead my horse by the bridle , if you please . as he spoke he dismounted , gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said , in a voice perfectly composed , to the palais royal , at full trot . the carriage drove on and d artagnan , availing himself of the darkness in the archway under which they were passing , threw himself into the arms of the prisoner .: 49.46
<S> but , pardon me , here are the health officers and the customs <UNK> coming alongside . and the young man went to the <UNK> .: 150.67
<S> everything was here arranged in perfect order ; each register had its number , each file of papers its place .: 370.23
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince : my lord , he said , will you permit me to <UNK> a few words on that subject , which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty ? the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance ; he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old .: 91.76
<S> for three months i watched m. de villefort , for three months he took not a step out of doors without my following him .: 71.49
<S> what do you intend to do ?: 8.36
<S> the young officer preserved silence .: 62.11
<S> go , valentine , said madame de saint me ran , and leave me with this gentleman . but , grandmamma leave me go ! the young girl kissed her grandmother , and left with her handkerchief to her eyes ; at the door she found the valet de chambre , who told her that the doctor was waiting in the dining room .: 22.56
<S> his life is dependent on the information he has given us ; if it is true , he shall be free ; if false , let him be shot . the prisoner was led away .: 64.97
<S> the servant went out , but returned almost immediately .: 45.65
<S> athos is near you , said d artagnan ; warn him as i have warned you . aramis easily aroused athos , whose sleep was light , like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution .: 140.29
<S> my dear danglars , said morcerf , we have been acquainted for many years , and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each other s <UNK> .: 52.55
<S> the abbe , the abbe ! murmured he , clenching his fists , and his teeth <UNK> .: 67.76
<S> dead bodies are not kept a year ; they are shown to a magistrate , and the evidence is taken .: 94.16
<S> with what view ? with the view of assassinating , or causing to be assassinated , the duke of buckingham . d artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation .: 67.13
<S> adieu !: 28.11
<S> and the greek princess , will she be here ? no , you will be deprived of that pleasure ; her position in the count s establishment is not sufficiently understood . wait ; leave me here , and go and speak to madame de villefort , who is trying to attract your attention . albert bowed to madame danglars , and advanced towards madame de villefort , whose lips opened as he approached .: 44.33
<S> so long as you are not mine , valentine , i shall always think i may lose you . oh , replied valentine with a convulsive movement , oh , indeed , maximilian , you are too timid for an officer , for a soldier who , they say , never knows fear .: 43.08
<S> debray ! muttered albert .: 43.46
<S> i have a post by which i live ; at the death of monsieur de tre ville , who is old , i may be a captain , which is a very snug berth for a once <UNK> gascon .: 78.93
<S> before the door the traces were yet more apparent ; these horsemen , whoever they might be , had halted there .: 167.12
<S> and i , doctor you know a man does not arrive at the post i occupy one has not been king s attorney twenty five years without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies ; mine are numerous .: 160.03
<S> he saw d artagnan s movement , heard the sound of the click , and stopped at once .: 28.32
<S> his eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majesty s favorite , if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for france and for ourselves . occupy yourselves with your own affairs , gentlemen , and let france settle matters as she will with me , resumed mazarin .: 168.86
<S> goeden <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> the ge <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . which means ? good day , sir !: 5180.10
<S> the general doubted my fidelity ? no , but i wish to have a share in my revenge .: 80.11
<S> you come from the queen ? said mazarin , looking fixedly at d artagnan .: 17.18
<S> madame de saint me ran , whom i once saw , was short , of slender form , and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament ; grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint me ran . at any rate , said albert , whatever disease or doctor may have killed her , m. de villefort , or rather , mademoiselle valentine , or , still rather , our friend franz , inherits a magnificent fortune , amounting , i believe , to <UNK> livres per annum . and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin , noirtier . that is a tenacious old grandfather , said beauchamp .: 86.54
<S> the name of sinbad the sailor , as may well be supposed , awakened in him a world of recollections , as had the name of the count of monte cristo on the previous evening .: 45.59
<S> certainly neither i nor fernand , said danglars , rising and looking at the young man , who still remained seated , but whose eye was fixed on the <UNK> sheet of paper flung into the corner .: 63.42
<S> i do not hold life dear enough to be afraid of death . yes , i know you are a man of a stout heart , monsieur , said the cardinal , with a voice almost affectionate ; i can therefore tell you beforehand you shall be tried , and even condemned . another might reply to your eminence that he had his pardon in his pocket .: 55.53
<S> felton snatched away the knife .: 98.35
<S> i swear to you , i protest oh , but god is above !: 49.96
<S> as to the astute aramis , he did not entertain much dread of him ; and supposing he should be able to get so far , he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least , by <UNK> him in the face , as c sar recommended his soldiers do to those of <UNK> , to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud .: 105.32
<S> adieu , my dear ge rard , and at your next journey alight at my door . noirtier left the room when he had finished , with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation .: 51.05
<S> by the bye , continued d artagnan , should this man attempt to fly or to call out , pass your sword through his body . the musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter , and d artagnan went out , followed by bernouin .: 71.86
<S> oh , yes it is you indeed !: 43.63
<S> do you doubt my word ? he said .: 14.09
<S> but does your grace mean to give me the studs without the casket ? the casket would encumber you .: 109.83
<S> monte cristo remained on the same spot until maximilian was out of sight ; he then walked slowly towards the alle es de meilhan to seek out a small house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this story .: 63.44
<S> why not , sir ? asked charles .: 26.58
<S> i shall not do so .: 13.72
<S> that s more time than we want .: 60.88
<S> the opinion of athos was that d artagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish .: 32.13
<S> are you ready ? asked felton .: 12.42
<S> now , then , said maximilian , leaning on the handle of his spade , i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count of monte cristo is acquainted with m. de villefort . chapter 52 .: 25.41
<S> well , then , sleep in peace , and put your trust in the lord . as we have before said , the post chaise was waiting ; four powerful horses were already <UNK> the ground with impatience , while ali , apparently just arrived from a long walk , was standing at the foot of the steps , his face bathed in perspiration .: 97.13
<S> again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers , who appeared to pity him .: 48.46
<S> what ! said kitty , blushing .: 17.04
<S> let us see what this letter contains . we here present the letter <UNK> : to his eminence , monseigneur le cardinal <UNK> : i have wished , monseigneur , to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in england .: 178.66
<S> from the time of his arrival in paris , he had been mixed up with public affairs ; but his own private affairs had made no great progress , either in love or fortune .: 56.90
<S> and what is your choice ? asked jussac .: 26.55
<S> in the centre of the cell , in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall , sat a man whose <UNK> garments scarcely covered him .: 122.41
<S> only remember this if you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear for you will look and you will listen , i am quite sure , however we may threaten you , you are lost . at these words he threw me a crown , which i picked up , and he took the ladder .: 55.02
<S> she seemed , however , by certain signs , to recognize a door , and approaching that door , and now , monsieur , said she , it is here i have business ; a thousand thanks for your honorable company , which has saved me from all the dangers to which , alone , i was exposed .: 63.33
<S> the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining room .: 87.06
<S> their course was clearly defined : they were to follow the road toward compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right .: 160.62
<S> it seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their <UNK> to it . do not be too hasty , m. morrel , replied villefort .: 54.08
<S> meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good .: 191.43
<S> i have come , therefore , to discharge this duty , and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude . and as he said this , the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual <UNK> .: 96.59
<S> but how can the news be brought to you ? nothing easier ; in a game of tennis , for example . in a game of tennis ? asked la ramee , giving more serious attention to the duke s words .: 57.02
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> i have <UNK> the vices that i had ; i have assumed the virtues that i had not .: 92.25
<S> the cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder .: 19.31
<S> he found him completely surrounded ; all were eager to speak to him , as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty .: 123.29
<S> general de quesnel accepted the condition , and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took .: 192.91
<S> the three lieutenants of the generalissimo .: 64.46
<S> d artagnan went straight to the sergeant .: 11.84
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> supper was served .: 74.86
<S> sit down , in mercy ! d artagnan , mute with anger and anxiety , took a seat in the threatening attitude of a judge .: 41.12
<S> do you think he would recollect you ? my faith , monsieur , he was in such trouble that i doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of me . well , go and talk with the boy , said d artagnan , and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is dead . planchet dismounted and went straight up to lubin , who did not at all remember him , and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible ; while d artagnan turned the two horses into a lane , went round the house , and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of <UNK> .: 65.52
<S> has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep ?: 137.48
<S> well , sir , you ought to know that we no longer have a police , since we are no longer at paris . i think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are , but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections . but , god forgive me ! cried anne , with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her , i believe that you are yourself interrogating . yes , madame , here i have a right to do so , for it concerns monsieur d artagnan d artagnan , he repeated , in such a manner as to bow the <UNK> brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman .: 62.29
<S> the poor fool is cured of his folly , and delivered from his captivity . wasn t his name faria ? inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor .: 91.69
<S> m. morrel and merce de s came to see him , but his door was closed ; and , although i was certain he was at home , he would not make any answer .: 23.80
<S> here are two hundred pistoles , which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity occurs .: 75.10
<S> the world excuses , and notoriety <UNK> you . madame , replied villefort , you know that i am no hypocrite , or , at least , that i never deceive without a reason .: 103.15
<S> monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell , instead of king charles , which would have been a disgrace , <UNK> from us to him , and from him to your majesty a dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son .: 77.81
<S> upon my honor and by the holy cross ; i only regret it because she was a woman . the most satisfactory part of the matter , said d artagnan , is that there remains no trace of it . she had a son , observed athos .: 54.86
<S> monsieur de comminges , he said , pardon me ; we both are servants of the queen , are we not ?: 23.28
<S> the moment is at hand , he said .: 21.48
<S> i dare not say more in a letter .: 41.64
<S> athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first .: 36.63
<S> the englishman , delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a kind disposition , pressed d artagnan in his arms , and paid a thousand compliments to the three musketeers , and as porthos s adversary was already installed in the carriage , and as aramis s had taken to his heels , they had nothing to think about but the dead .: 64.92
<S> you will see the same at every opening from this palace to which i should lead you .: 85.48
<S> the insult was terrible , and although unknown to the rest of the world , i felt it live and <UNK> at the bottom of my heart .: 47.58
<S> you know , dear d artagnan , i am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman .: 56.96
<S> to old times , he said .: 37.89
<S> of what must i repent ? stammered danglars .: 55.49
<S> she fainted .: 56.38
<S> ah ! he said , wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead , how lucky it was that mousqueton was thirsty ! he made haste to pass out by the opening , still thinking himself in a dream ; but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare .: 97.59
<S> near paris , is it not ? very near , only half a league from the barriers , it is at auteuil . at auteuil ? said villefort ; true , madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil , since it was to your house that she was taken .: 50.06
<S> edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse , heard the voice of the governor , who asked them to throw water on the dead man s face ; and seeing that , in spite of this application , the prisoner did not recover , they sent for the doctor .: 48.80
<S> the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin .: 131.13
<S> d artagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their companions , and all four set forward ; athos upon a horse he owed to a woman , aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress , porthos on a horse he owed to his procurator s wife , and d artagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortune the best mistress possible .: 87.73
<S> d artagnan , he said , you are here to night , still infuriated by yesterday s adventure .: 49.72
<S> such things , continued bertuccio , shaking his head , are only related under the seal of confession . then , said the count , i refer you to your confessor .: 54.67
<S> does he often go to auteuil ? added he .: 70.85
<S> dante s , cast from solitude into the world , frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude ; and what solitude is more complete , or more poetical , than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night , in the silence of immensity , and under the eye of heaven ?: 129.06
<S> i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans .: 52.34
<S> it was then he heard a voice exclaim valentine is dead ! and another voice which , like an echo repeated : dead , dead ! <UNK> chapter 103 .: 176.85
<S> the day passed away in utter silence night came without recurrence of the noise .: 167.91
<S> my money boxes are my <UNK> , as , i think , m. <UNK> says , and i will not retard its course , or disturb its calm .: 250.55
<S> providence still , murmured he ; now only am i fully convinced of being the emissary of god ! chapter 91 .: 167.54
<S> i know these airs ; i myself came to paris with four crowns in my purse , and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell me i was not in a condition to purchase the louvre . d artagnan s bearing became still more imposing .: 87.99
<S> he is pursued . but where is he ?: 32.22
<S> that falls out <UNK> !: 823.95
<S> d artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle .: 40.59
<S> gendarmes , i am at your service .: 27.40
<S> ah , said the count , watching andrea s countenance , i do not demand any confession from you ; it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca .: 66.72
<S> monsieur , you run no risk , for , as i told you , i will stay here ; so there is no chance of my escaping . you do not reply to my question , replied the inspector impatiently .: 37.24
<S> well , beautiful lady , very well , said he ; but , pardieu , if you don t calm yourself , i will design a second fleur de lis upon one of those pretty cheeks ! scoundrel , infamous scoundrel ! howled milady .: 123.14
<S> she sat down , took edward on her knees , and from time to time pressed this child , on whom her affections appeared centred , almost convulsively to her bosom .: 68.33
<S> m. de villefort followed them .: 16.89
<S> from whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife ? from monsieur laporte . did he give you any details ? he knew none himself . and you have learned nothing from any other quarter ? yes , i have received what ? i fear i am committing a great imprudence . you always come back to that ; but i must make you see this time that it is too late to retreat . i do not retreat , mordieu ! cried the citizen , swearing in order to rouse his courage .: 71.33
<S> and pray what would come to pass , supposing the king were five years older than he is ? as soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands himself , and tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of henry iv .: 104.90
<S> come , my friend , said danglars , seeing that he made no impression on peppino , you will not refuse me a glass of wine ? i have already told you that we do not sell at <UNK> . well , then , let me have a bottle of the least <UNK> . they are all the same price . and what is that ? twenty five thousand francs a bottle . tell me , cried danglars , in a tone whose bitterness <UNK> alone has been capable of revealing tell me that you wish to <UNK> me of all ; it will be sooner over than devouring me <UNK> . it is possible such may be the master s intention . the master ? who is he ? the person to whom you were conducted yesterday . where is he ? here . let me see him . certainly . and the next moment luigi vampa appeared before danglars .: 66.40
<S> we must leave you , said monte cristo .: 11.28
<S> does the house approve that the examination should take place today ? <UNK> yes , was the unanimous answer .: 228.17
<S> his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel , who began his story with trembling .: 212.11
<S> your servants , said he , who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story ; from them i learned it all . but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here , love . forgive me , replied morrel ; i will go away . no , said valentine , you might meet someone ; stay . but if anyone should come here the young girl shook her head .: 78.28
<S> i say that valentine is dead ! replied d avrigny , in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness .: 42.09
<S> i have another commission for you , m. bertuccio , said he ; i am desirous of having an estate by the <UNK> in normandy for instance , between le havre and boulogne .: 91.12
<S> a bed of dried grass covered with goat skins was placed in one corner .: 127.93
<S> see what an exordium ! cried the jesuit .: 90.63
<S> i do not know i only guess it , because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners cells . yes , sir , a rope ladder and tools . and have you them yet ? no , sir ; i sold them to visitors , who considered them great curiosities ; but i have still something left . what is it ? asked the count , impatiently .: 78.07
<S> such is the atrocious logic of revolutions .: 280.99
<S> d artagnan came again on the morrow , and was still better received than on the evening before .: 47.38
<S> what a wrist you have , reverend sir ! said caderousse , <UNK> his arm , all bruised by the <UNK> pincers which had held it ; what a wrist ! silence !: 198.49
<S> take her six bottles of different wine <UNK> , sherry , and malaga , and a barrel of <UNK> oysters ; get them at <UNK> s , and be sure you say they are for me . at what o clock , sir , do you breakfast ? <UNK> what time is it now ? a quarter to ten . very well , at half past ten .: 132.68
<S> the worn out steps were old acquaintances of his ; he knew better than anyone else how to open that weather beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the <UNK> within .: 583.52
<S> danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then , and gradually the man appeared less ugly , the bread less black , and the cheese more fresh , while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain <UNK> and side dishes , which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said , monsieur <UNK> , let me have a nice little <UNK> today . he got up and knocked on the door ; the bandit raised his head .: 277.85
<S> on leaving the chamber , danglars , who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting , and been more bitter than ever against the ministry , re entered his carriage , and told the coachman to drive to the avenue des champs e lyse es , no .: 89.26
<S> he comprehended that the musket had not come there of itself , and that he who bore it had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly intentions .: 103.57
<S> the valet entered .: 22.87
<S> directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard , but no one paid any attention to it ; the nurse was engaged in watching the <UNK> <UNK> , and villefort was still absorbed in grief .: 95.11
<S> one day the young shepherd told the count s steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the sabine mountains , and <UNK> around his flock .: 92.75
<S> sir , said he , you are aware that valentine is about to enter her <UNK> year , which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance .: 76.29
<S> it was about eleven o clock at night .: 14.79
<S> hence that immense fortune , which , in lord wilmore s opinion , possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum , a precarious fortune , which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine .: 107.69
<S> d artagnan , in his turn , sprang to the ground , and just at the moment when the coachman , alarmed at not seeing his master , fell back a step , he seized him by his collar with the left , whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast .: 32.81
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> the songs of the birds were heard in an <UNK> hard by , and the branches of <UNK> and rose <UNK> formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains .: 424.16
<S> the latter recollected the terrible caution of monte cristo ; she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife .: 132.69
<S> first , my stranger of meung ; then de wardes , to whom i have given three sword wounds ; next milady , whose secret i have discovered ; finally , the cardinal , whose vengeance i have <UNK> . well , said athos , that only makes four ; and we are four one for one .: 128.51
<S> and now , said athos , it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen , but we must map up our campaign .: 92.23
<S> suppose that the supreme being , after having created the world and <UNK> chaos , had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her <UNK> eyes ; suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for god to look upon his work and see that it was good suppose he had <UNK> out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal night then even then , merce de s , you could not imagine what i lose in sacrificing my life at this moment . merce de s looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment , her admiration , and her gratitude .: 171.45
<S> bonacieux moved by a double sentiment love and curiosity .: 214.78
<S> athos slowly raised his pistol , stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched milady s forehead , and then , in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution , madame , said he , you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed ; or upon my soul , i will blow your brains out . with another man , milady might have preserved some doubt ; but she knew athos .: 92.84
<S> oh , the heartless , treacherous scoundrels ! exclaimed dante s , pressing his hand to his throbbing brows .: 71.06
<S> he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost , and that he would seek your father until he found him .: 37.65
<S> it was a dull , <UNK> night .: 88.68
<S> mademoiselle de villefort took from the hands of barrois , who was sent out , the lemonade which m. noirtier had every morning , and he has escaped by a miracle .: 56.74
<S> i shall not go . why ? asked porthos .: 16.13
<S> they are , no doubt , both curious and interesting . yes , yes ; but let us go .: 36.03
<S> the notes reminded the men that the children , women , and old men whom they allowed to die were their sons , their wives , and their fathers , and that it would be more just for everyone to be reduced to the common misery , in order that equal conditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions .: 131.85
<S> he was without a hat , carried a sword , and flourished a handkerchief in his hand .: 38.42
<S> gentlemen and citizens , set me free ; i shall go to the louvre and strangle mazarin .: 105.82
<S> d artagnan came the next day to milady s , and finding her in a very ill humor , had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from m. de wardes that provoked her thus .: 55.81
<S> d artagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain , and in the very first man who entered he recognized planchet .: 60.98
<S> franz dressed himself , and went out , telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of bracciano s .: 27.27
<S> when all had gone out and the door was closed , m. de tre ville , on turning round , found himself alone with the young man .: 24.06
<S> with your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping , you <UNK> me so that i dreamed that i was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so . la ramee laughed .: 246.80
<S> because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon , of which you have no doubt heard tell . and are you going to leave me at such a time ? this very instant . and where are you going ? ah , if you could tell me that , you would be doing me a service . ah , me !: 52.40
<S> i fell upon one knee , then upon both .: 126.30
<S> de chevreuse not only served the queen in her political intrigues , but , what tormented him still more , in her amorous intrigues .: 152.86
<S> having given various orders to bertuccio relative to the <UNK> and <UNK> he desired to make in the house , the count , drawing out his watch , said to the attentive nubian : it is half past eleven o clock ; hayde e will soon be here .: 116.08
<S> the murdered man lay on the floor , his head leaning against the wall , and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast ; there was a fourth gash , in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle .: 71.88
<S> then they departed , without knowing whether they would ever see each other again .: 39.31
<S> de saint me ran ? said madame de villefort ; then this house belonged to m. de saint me ran before you bought it ? it appears so , replied monte cristo .: 18.66
<S> is the abbe at home ? asked he .: 16.12
<S> then , said d artagnan , let us give the money to the lackeys , as lord de winter desired us to do . yes , said athos ; let us give the money to the lackeys not to our lackeys , but to the lackeys of the englishmen . athos took the purse , and threw it into the hand of the coachman .: 23.78
<S> moreover , its port was the last in the kingdom of france open to the english , and by closing it against england , our eternal enemy , the cardinal completed the work of <UNK> of <UNK> and the duc de guise .: 151.49
<S> he told me let me think what was it ?: 33.89
<S> athos , on the other hand , reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by d artagnan .: 126.72
<S> a murder ?: 100.77
<S> you are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom ; you are charged with having surprised state secrets ; you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general . and who charges me with this , monseigneur ? said d artagnan , who had no doubt the accusation came from milady , a woman branded by the justice of the country ; a woman who has espoused one man in france and another in england ; a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me ! what do you say , monsieur ? cried the cardinal , astonished ; and of what woman are you speaking thus ? of milady de winter , replied d artagnan , yes , of milady de winter , of whose crimes your eminence is doubtless ignorant , since you have honored her with your confidence . monsieur , said the cardinal , if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge , she shall be punished . she has been punished , monseigneur . and who has punished her ? we . she is in prison ? she is dead . dead ! repeated the cardinal , who could not believe what he heard , dead !: 69.02
<S> i have not your confidence ; i fear the cardinal . hush ! said mme .: 26.12
<S> why , you told me he was a young man ?: 13.03
<S> dante s must be crushed to gratify villefort s ambition .: 168.22
<S> but man man , whom god created in his own image man , upon whom god has laid his first , his sole <UNK> , to love his neighbor man , to whom god has given a voice to express his thoughts what is his first cry when he hears his fellow man is saved ?: 201.25
<S> i will call for them . today ? no , tomorrow ; i shall not have time today . well , tomorrow i will leave them when i go to auteuil . may i depend on it ? certainly . because i shall secure my <UNK> on the strength of it . now see here , will that be all ?: 61.39
<S> the citizen made a fresh pause and continued , i have a wife who is seamstress to the queen , monsieur , and who is not <UNK> in either virtue or beauty .: 133.11
<S> i have always observed that they bandage people s eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces , for instance , those of raoul in the huguenots , and really i have nothing to complain of , for what i see makes me think of the wonders of the arabian nights . <UNK> alas !: 207.60
<S> my fortune , though small , is free and <UNK> , and the memory of my late father is respected in our country , valentine , as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city ; i say our country , because you were born not far from marseilles . don t speak of marseilles , i beg of you , maximilian ; that one word brings back my mother to my recollection my angel mother , who died too soon for myself and all who knew her ; but who , after watching over her child during the brief period <UNK> to her in this world , now , i fondly hope , watches from her home in heaven .: 116.73
<S> ministers , princes , kings , will pass away like mountain torrents ; civil war , like a forest flame ; but we we shall remain ; i have a presentiment that we shall . yes , replied d artagnan , let us still be musketeers , and let us retain as our battle standard that famous napkin of the bastion st. gervais , on which the great cardinal had three fleurs de lis embroidered . be it so , cried aramis .: 175.33
<S> so now i have told my secret . a telegraph ? repeated madame de villefort .: 31.95
<S> <UNK> s <UNK> , said groslow , as the four friends entered , i had almost given you up . d artagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear : the fact is , we , that is , monsieur du vallon and i , hesitated a little . and why ? d artagnan looked significantly toward athos and aramis .: 56.86
<S> a handkerchief , tied at the four corners , is to be the signal . next moment d artagnan entered .: 84.80
<S> but can they , will they receive an unhappy king , who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil <UNK> ?: 233.95
<S> dante s reflected , as he worked , on the shout of joy which , with a single word , he could <UNK> from all these men , if he gave utterance to the one <UNK> thought that pervaded his heart ; but , far from disclosing this precious secret , he almost feared that he had already said too much , and by his <UNK> and continual questions , his minute observations and evident preoccupation , aroused suspicions .: 165.58
<S> his father ! yes , his father , replied the abbe ; his right name was noirtier de villefort . at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dante s , and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before .: 52.05
<S> swear , then , said villefort , joining the hands of morrel and d avrigny , swear that you will spare the honor of my house , and leave me to avenge my child . d avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble yes , but morrel , disengaging his hand , rushed to the bed , and after having pressed the cold lips of valentine with his own , hurriedly left , uttering a long , deep groan of despair and anguish .: 57.87
<S> and prince cavalcanti sang with mademoiselle euge nie yesterday ?: 391.90
<S> prepare yourself , then , to start at once . and by whom is this order given ? asked the king .: 31.32
<S> oh , selfish man !: 42.54
<S> they reached the queen s apartments , but were compelled to stop in the ante chamber , since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from england .: 67.90
<S> i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics .: 94.73
<S> his shoulder knots were of <UNK> silver , his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it ; a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat ; his boots were of black leather , and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that porthos had so often admired in the rue <UNK> .: 274.05
<S> is it mazarin s proximity that makes you so prudent ? oh , you hear that , flamarens ! said chatillon .: 116.76
<S> i swear to you , i like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path . ah !: 45.51
<S> have you a name , then ? i bear that of your brother . ay , but you are mistaken .: 35.75
<S> oh , attend to it , valentine , i entreat you . but no , said valentine , no , i tell you it is all past , and it was nothing .: 27.40
<S> this appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses , and finding that i could no longer be of service to anyone in the house , my only desire was to fly .: 105.36
<S> he imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in dreams .: 199.22
<S> no , replied the soldier , tenacious in his <UNK> ; he has foretold many things which have come to pass ; for instance , that the queen would have a son ; that monsieur coligny would be killed in a duel with the duc de guise ; and finally , that the coadjutor would be made cardinal .: 66.82
<S> merce de s was the only one awake in the whole settlement .: 49.97
<S> it was the last <UNK> for life contending with the resolution of despair ; then his dungeon seemed less sombre , his prospects less desperate .: 210.76
<S> beppo got in , inviting the frenchman to follow him , and he did not wait to be asked twice .: 74.47
<S> those barrels i saw through the door ? port ! replied grimaud , beginning a fresh sum .: 133.43
<S> 30 the miser in molie re s comedy of l avare . ed .: 904.01
<S> all our servants are busy , discussing the grand affair .: 136.39
<S> pardon me , madame , for having by a trick unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger ; and i , in exchange , pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me .: 96.19
<S> milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled ; she reached her hand quickly to her bosom , drew out a paper , and held it toward athos .: 47.17
<S> of russia are the only two monarchs of their set on record who were at once sovereigns and lovers .: 534.49
<S> what could he say ?: 11.87
<S> but should you find the means of retaining them , remember , my lord , that i shall esteem you as having rendered the greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen ; and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my children . madame , replied de winter , your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you .: 50.46
<S> the sword of the eternal is too heavy for my arm .: 82.28
<S> i shall be gone only a few moments . villefort hastily quitted the apartment , but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion , he resumed his ordinary pace .: 102.89
<S> the peasants were in great commotion .: 107.79
<S> but what can they intend to do with the poor creature , and how shall i ever meet her again ? friend , said athos , gravely , remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth .: 38.77
<S> whip !: 597.88
<S> madame , cried mazarin , you have ruined us all the king , yourself and me . at this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal , anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled comminges .: 79.53
<S> we beg them to take one step backward , and to transport themselves , the morning of that day of great catastrophes , into the <UNK> , gilded salon we have before shown them , and which was the pride of its owner , baron danglars .: 148.89
<S> at the <UNK> minute of this hour , if the money is not forthcoming , he blows out the prisoner s brains with a pistol shot , or plants his dagger in his heart , and that settles the account . well , albert , inquired franz of his companion , are you still disposed to go to the colosseum by the outer wall ? quite so , said albert , if the way be picturesque . the clock struck nine as the door opened , and a coachman appeared .: 84.71
<S> but he was soon aroused from these reflections by lubin , who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might .: 172.23
<S> as to that , we know d artagnan s courage ; he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle .: 78.41
<S> suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard , and almost immediately a carriage appeared , drawn by a pair of wild , ungovernable horses , while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed .: 184.19
<S> the host armed himself with a spit , and rushed into the chamber occupied by the two friends .: 33.73
<S> here were not , as in other tombs , ignoble drawers , one above another , where <UNK> <UNK> its dead and <UNK> them like specimens in a museum ; all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy looking room , separated by a wall from the vault itself .: 345.58
<S> where is he ? in my wife s chamber , on the first flight , where they are dressing his wounds . his things and his bag are with him ?: 104.84
<S> the journey monte cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men together .: 74.96
<S> here is a letter , which must be taken to its address . to its address , my lord ?: 38.96
<S> he was an <UNK> , gigantic bandit , with large eyes , thick lips , and a flat nose ; his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like <UNK> around his shoulders .: 140.93
<S> yes , said porthos , but there are the equipments . that is very true .: 22.08
<S> an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down , certainly , but not forever .: 157.42
<S> d artagnan entered behind him .: 20.50
<S> and that one , if i mistake not , a lamprey . just so .: 102.13
<S> because if , as you say , athos and aramis are in real danger , this is not the time to abandon them .: 35.48
<S> <UNK> ! cried athos .: 46.25
<S> what has become of him ?: 8.77
<S> i pardon you , said he , for the poisoning of my brother , and the assassination of his grace , lord buckingham .: 39.32
<S> ah , cried d artagnan , really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to <UNK> in his heart , ah , that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me ; and i have such fear that it should fly away from me like a dream that i <UNK> to make a reality of it . well , merit this pretended happiness , then ! i am at your orders , said d artagnan .: 65.77
<S> i like , said he , to feel a hand like this , when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause . it seems to me , said emmanuel , that i see two young men down there , who are evidently , waiting . monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brother in law .: 89.60
<S> the whole army talked of this expedition for a day , and monsieur paid him his compliments upon it .: 95.35
<S> you know one can not change his nature , he said .: 46.72
<S> what man is that ? cried milady , suffocated by terror , her hair <UNK> itself , and rising above her livid countenance as if alive .: 103.74
<S> now , said the steward , what have you to tell me ? and you ? said andrea .: 13.22
<S> shake hands i <UNK> your friendship . sir , said raoul , returning the count s pressure of the hand , i like you already , from my heart ; pray regard me as a devoted friend , i beseech you . and now , where are you going , viscount ? inquired de guiche .: 62.36
<S> friends !: 157.17
<S> he appeared calm , but it was evidently not without a mighty effort .: 85.24
<S> you hear , madame ? yes , sire , i hear , stammered the queen .: 20.26
<S> <UNK> , let him send one of his best , but not such a one as he made for la ramee .: 82.73
<S> i do not . hem ! said d artagnan , there is some truth in what you say . ah !: 23.40
<S> but at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk .: 64.31
<S> the cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire ; the three musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters .: 31.29
<S> in the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the <UNK> as far as the king s window , and one of the <UNK> fell on his leg and broke it . ah ! cried aramis , that accounts for the cry i heard . probably , said d artagnan , but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold , and wrote the moment he was brought home to master tom lowe , an assistant carpenter and friend of his , to go down to whitehall , with three of his friends .: 122.14
<S> ah , i can understand how the sight of him struck you , replied lord de winter .: 27.21
<S> consequently he had appeared to believe all that the <UNK> musketeer had told him , convinced that no friendship will hold out against a surprised secret .: 156.12
<S> i am betrayed on all sides .: 34.51
<S> at the door he paused for a moment to <UNK> his damp , pale brow .: 73.21
<S> i ?: 34.71
<S> my deduction is , replied villefort , that my father , led away by his passions , has committed some fault unknown to human justice , but marked by the justice of god .: 88.11
<S> you say you have nothing to do with my cash box .: 36.47
<S> after some minutes the door opened and a footman announced mademoiselle paulet .: 43.16
<S> the two friends made an appointment for ten o clock on the following day ; for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel , aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left athos to enter alone .: 51.12
<S> but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company , sir , said monte cristo .: 27.87
<S> and , added he , biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread , i have formed a plan . caderousse s plans alarmed andrea still more than his ideas ; ideas were but the <UNK> , the plan was reality .: 171.01
<S> mousqueton , grimaud and blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first street .: 62.64
<S> d artagnan , in particular , had a perpetual buzzing in his ears , which porthos explained thus : a very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere . at length the escort passed through paris on the twenty third , in the night .: 104.78
<S> this is not my weakness , i tell you at once ; family joys have no charm for me .: 92.92
<S> bertuccio ! cried he , striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong .: 136.11
<S> but remorse is not thus banished ; like virgil s wounded hero , he carried the arrow in his wound , and , arrived at the salon , villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob , and sank into a chair .: 97.32
<S> the marchioness drained the glass at a single draught , and then turned on her pillow , repeating , the notary , the notary ! m. de villefort left the room , and valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother .: 61.20
<S> i not only permit , i desire ; let them come in . the marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince .: 80.85
<S> still , then , i am a prisoner , said milady , looking around her , and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer ; but i feel assured it will not be for long , added she .: 29.48
<S> the three windows were still <UNK> .: 84.35
<S> i have not failed to do so , your <UNK> , replied the young man , returning their salutation .: 46.81
<S> when i awoke , a fresh meal was served .: 128.13
<S> meanwhile , villefort and d avrigny had made all possible haste , valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival , and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded , and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold .: 136.97
<S> sit down there and eat in security .: 133.74
<S> that is all very simple : you had business in england . monseigneur , said d artagnan , quite confused , i went hunting at windsor , or elsewhere that concerns nobody .: 70.68
<S> in this room , at about ten o clock in the morning , the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness , watching both doors , and listening to every sound .: 69.58
<S> had this been all , it might not , perhaps , have greatly signified ; for when the lower classes alone complained , the court of france , separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the <UNK> and the bourgeoisie , seldom listened to their voice ; but unluckily , mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the court of requests , at a high price ; and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places , and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place , the old <UNK> formed a union amongst themselves , and , enraged , swore on the bible not to allow of this addition to their number , but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue ; and should any one of them chance to <UNK> his post by this resistance , to <UNK> to indemnify him for his loss .: 211.63
<S> for all evils there are two remedies time and silence .: 344.27
<S> well , i must confess it does , replied d artagnan .: 17.23
<S> so that in spite of edicts , <UNK> , and decrees , there he is , captain of the musketeers ; that is to say , chief of a legion of c sars , whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal <UNK> he who <UNK> nothing , as it is said .: 144.99
<S> night came , and with it the preparation for departure , and these preparations served to conceal dante s agitation .: 123.89
<S> they had a youth with them ? yes , sire , and one wounded man ; so that three of the king s musketeers one of whom was wounded and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal s guardsmen , but absolutely brought four of them to earth . why , this is a victory ! cried the king , all radiant , a complete victory ! yes , sire ; as complete as that of the bridge of ce . four men , one of them wounded , and a youth , say you ? one hardly a young man ; but who , however , behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty . how does he call himself ? d artagnan , sire ; he is the son of one of my oldest friends the son of a man who served under the king your father , of glorious memory , in the civil war . and you say this young man behaved himself well ?: 81.55
<S> when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter , it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night .: 52.76
<S> however , if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg work in a format other than plain <UNK> <UNK> or other format used in the official <UNK> posted on the official project gutenberg website www.gutenberg.org , you must , at no additional cost , fee or expense to the user , provide a copy , a means of <UNK> a copy , or a means of obtaining a copy upon request , of the work in its original plain <UNK> <UNK> or other form .: 262.91
<S> answer me without acting as if you were on the stage ; your interests are concerned in your so doing . faith , my lord , it is very necessary for me to make my fortune , your eminence has so long forgotten me . we need only a week to <UNK> all that .: 72.24
<S> ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard , and the door was kept by the three french attendants , commanded by myrtho .: 145.44
<S> you are wounded , said he .: 11.19
<S> who made the lemonade ? i did . did you bring it to your master directly it was made ? no . you left it somewhere , then , in the meantime ? yes ; i left it in the <UNK> , because i was called away . who brought it into this room , then ? mademoiselle valentine . d avrigny struck his forehead with his hand .: 69.28
<S> oh , continue ! said the duchess .: 31.68
<S> it is horrible , indeed , but no one <UNK> . the eyes of noirtier lighted up with rage , and d avrigny prepared to speak .: 51.42
<S> the same evening andrea was <UNK> in the conciergerie .: 109.85
<S> de guise ?: 195.01
<S> some wine ! cried the stupefied host , some wine ?: 96.33
<S> they had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within , when someone knocked at the yard shutter ; they demanded who was there , and recognizing the voices of their lackeys , opened the shutter .: 133.03
<S> her face , therefore , like that of the gentleman , was perfectly unknown to the two <UNK> , who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion .: 123.77
<S> the opportunity was good .: 48.34
<S> it is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital ? yes , monseigneur . you came through meung , where something befell you .: 80.31
<S> i am in a hurry to begin .: 18.42
<S> tis not one man , not athos only , not the comte de la fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness , but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you . be it so then , replied athos , sorrowfully .: 79.03
<S> we want money for our return to paris . i am much attached to that horse , athos . and there again you are wrong .: 59.41
<S> a few hundred yards beyond the town d artagnan drew rein .: 167.60
<S> i have seen nothing of him the last three or four days . nor i , said madame danglars ; but you began a sentence , sir , and did not finish . which ? m .: 44.86
<S> marseilles resounded with their well earned praises .: 441.76
<S> but at daybreak he awoke .: 35.66
<S> stop , stop ! cried he whom they had addressed as my lord ; tis not his voice . ah !: 71.44
<S> morrel smiled , and shook his head .: 11.58
<S> without the loss of an instant , the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay .: 74.07
<S> yes . but , said the notary , you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony ? yes . you only intend , then , to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to <UNK> from the inheritance of your son ? noirtier made no answer .: 60.85
<S> i understand the nature of your alarms , madame , said the count , carefully examining the child , but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness ; your little charge has not received the least injury ; his insensibility is merely the effects of terror , and will soon pass . are you quite sure you do not say so to <UNK> my fears ?: 81.61
<S> porthos began to hope that the thing would take place at the present sitting , and in that same <UNK> ; but the procurator would listen to nothing , he would be taken to his room , and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest , upon the edge of which , for still greater precaution , he placed his feet .: 64.34
<S> d artagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke , who , having accompanied him in all his voyages , spoke french perfectly well ; he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death , and that he must speak with his master instantly .: 58.10
<S> twenty three thousand francs , said she .: 36.44
<S> why , he imprisoned himself , i swear to you he did .: 41.38
<S> but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us ? asked aramis .: 71.43
<S> the brigadier and two pioneers fell dead ; the rest of the troop took to flight .: 100.34
<S> as for myself , that i may put you at your ease , i tell you that i am generally called sinbad the sailor . and i , replied franz , will tell you , as i only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like <UNK> , that i see no reason why at this moment i should not be called <UNK> .: 67.55
<S> the sportsman instantly changed his direction , and ran quickly towards them .: 92.15
<S> hayde e chapter 78 .: 50.71
<S> i advise you to complain ! said porthos .: 22.67
<S> in the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not .: 49.06
<S> the comte de la fere . athos !: 14.21
<S> you agree that you have no remedies for negligence , strict liability , breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1.f.3 .: 32.30
<S> it was noirtier the lemonade was intended for it is noirtier , logically speaking , who drank it .: 162.72
<S> these two shots had mortally wounded my father , and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries .: 90.74
<S> the penalty of death , i greatly fear ; they have gone too far for him to pardon them , and there is nothing left to them but one thing , and that is to kill him .: 48.94
<S> have you <UNK> to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth ? we have . remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman . yes , yes , my lord ; don t be uneasy . besides , i shall be there . you will assure us that justice yes , yes !: 72.61
<S> no , i did not say i was a stranger to you .: 18.26
<S> five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette , where pretty madeleine , the hostess , came to him .: 42.17
<S> do you desire it as ardently as you say ? yes . well , then , you shall have it ! the young girl , much astonished , raised her head to look at him , but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips .: 30.18
<S> he is at constantinople . among the turks ! exclaimed raoul , alarmed .: 91.41
<S> madame de villefort rose , monte cristo did the same , and the rest followed their example .: 37.35
<S> maximilian chapter 104 .: 130.20
<S> the three young people were talking together .: 20.73
<S> take it , and there ends the matter . what , cried athos , are you selling my horse my <UNK> ?: 142.45
<S> barrois , cried valentine , barrois ! i am coming , mademoiselle , replied he .: 36.10
<S> the two assistants carried andrea up to the scaffold ; the people all took part against andrea , and twenty thousand voices cried , put him to death !: 185.81
<S> then a strange reaction took place ; he who had just abandoned 5,000,000 endeavored to save the 50,000 francs he had left , and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of <UNK> he was deluded by the <UNK> that is a <UNK> of madness .: 224.37
<S> have you not , happy rogue that you are have you not your duchess , who can not fail to come to your aid ? well , you see , my dear d artagnan , with what ill luck i play , replied porthos , with the most careless air in the world .: 46.75
<S> i will not talk . here is the knife , said felton , drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought , according to his promise , but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner .: 33.40
<S> this desperate resistance could not last long .: 181.54
<S> an instant after dante s entered .: 12.93
<S> but i have always observed that poisoners were cowards .: 94.06
<S> at length his eyes opened , but they were at first fixed and <UNK> ; then sight returned , and with it feeling and grief .: 83.77
<S> gad , i should be very happy , but i have my companion , monsieur du vallon , and the two prisoners , whom i can not leave .: 26.88
<S> now , monsieur , he said to raoul , will you give me the letter you have brought ? raoul handed the letter to the prince .: 20.59
<S> shall we return to the camp ? said porthos .: 17.12
<S> do you recognize the carriage ? he asked the sergeant .: 26.18
<S> my sporting dogs consist of two <UNK> , two harriers and two <UNK> .: 864.68
<S> you are acquainted with the scriptures ? d artagnan thought of the appointment mme .: 42.57
<S> mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity .: 69.64
<S> well , sir , resumed danglars , after a brief silence , i will endeavor to make myself understood , by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me ? why , truly , replied monte cristo , determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained , my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need . the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand .: 59.78
<S> no , replied noirtier eagerly .: 25.50
<S> some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends , for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write .: 62.03
<S> at malta , i loved a young girl , was on the point of marrying her , when war came and carried me away .: 60.38
<S> his visitor appeared slightly uneasy .: 108.94
<S> i shall , perhaps , have something to say to you . and he went out .: 17.07
<S> should it not be found in possession of either father or son , then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dante s on board the pharaon . how dreadful ! said merce de s , passing her hand across her brow , moist with perspiration ; and that letter i bought it for two hundred thousand francs , madame , said monte cristo ; but that is a trifle , since it enables me to justify myself to you . and the result of that letter you well know , madame , was my arrest ; but you do not know how long that arrest lasted .: 59.62
<S> powerful memories were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower , fort saint nicolas , the city hall designed by <UNK> the port with its <UNK> quays , where they had both played in childhood , and it was with one accord that they stopped on the canebie re .: 267.18
<S> no ?: 47.81
<S> he s in the bastile . that is to say , he was there , replied planchet .: 24.83
<S> the young man you speak of , said villefort abruptly , is a great criminal , and i can do nothing for him , mademoiselle . merce de s burst into tears , and , as villefort strove to pass her , again addressed him .: 42.40
<S> we are well aware that this term , milady , is only properly used when followed by a family name .: 133.81
<S> tis well , we will see if the king s name is not a passport everywhere , replied the gascon .: 31.84
<S> the brief space had , however , been sufficient for a man , followed by a number of servants , to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred , and , as the coachman opened the door of the carriage , to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand , while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy , who had lost consciousness .: 68.75
<S> have you lost it ? asked blaisois .: 12.44
<S> what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men ? two men how do you mean ? yes , the king and his lackey . oh !: 56.72
<S> are you come to fetch me ? asked he .: 12.60
<S> and as for me , said porthos , i swear nothing , but i m choked .: 39.58
<S> they went over a tolerably large ground floor ; a first floor consisted of a salon , a <UNK> , and two bedrooms ; near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden .: 107.06
<S> franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum , while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of <UNK> <UNK> ; and , to his credit be it spoken , his mind , even amid the <UNK> <UNK> of the guides , was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw ; and certainly no <UNK> notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them , and more especially by moonlight , at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern <UNK> sky , whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western <UNK> .: 334.27
<S> on the staircase he met athos and porthos , who were coming to see him .: 16.30
<S> captivity : the second day milady dreamed that she at length had d artagnan in her power , that she was present at his execution ; and it was the sight of his odious blood , flowing beneath the ax of the headsman , which spread that charming smile upon her lips .: 95.39
<S> the stranger advanced slowly , and as he advanced , after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp , milady involuntarily drew back .: 87.48
<S> if it is a workman , i need but knock against the wall , and he will cease to work , in order to find out who is knocking , and why he does so ; but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor , he will soon resume it .: 64.35
<S> it was not the one she wished for most , but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her .: 32.89
<S> though it certainly does cost france somewhat dear to assert her rights in that <UNK> country . brutal politics , i must confess . said maximilian ; but don t attach any serious importance , dear , to what your father said .: 352.76
<S> this hurt is just the fellow of the one i had on the road to amiens . porthos turned around like a lion , plunged on the dismounted cavalier , who tried to draw his sword ; but before it was out of the scabbard , porthos , with the hilt of his had struck him such a terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox beneath the butcher s knife .: 82.58
<S> but this is tyranny ! cried one of them , in very good french , though with a foreign accent , that this madman will not allow these good people access to their own wine !: 120.39
<S> on seeing him , the regiment of corinth , which the coadjutor had not been able to <UNK> in spite of all his efforts , threw itself into the midst of the parisian forces , put them into confusion and re entered charenton flying .: 86.81
<S> he remained there ten minutes , motionless and dumb , listening to the beating of his own heart .: 59.30
<S> the queen appeared , and was followed by the king and the duke d anjou , his brother .: 32.43
<S> as porthos had foreseen , the cavalcade produced a good effect ; and if mme .: 76.45
<S> give me a simple assignment of your debt ; acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash , and i will hand you over the money . he rose , gave his seat to m. de boville , who took it without ceremony , and quickly drew up the required assignment , while the englishman counted out the bank notes on the other side of the desk .: 76.05
<S> after the king and the cardinal , m. de tre ville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military , and even by citizens .: 62.29
<S> you would have done what i did . mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat , for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength .: 86.83
<S> he was one of those men who do not rashly court danger , but if danger presents itself , combat it with the most unalterable coolness .: 146.61
<S> are you displeased with me ? cried valentine in astonishment .: 33.68
<S> that s unpardonable in a man of your age , and who besides , has such a pretty wife as yours . oh , lord !: 74.27
<S> hark !: 73.38
<S> life for life , man for man ; give me one , i will give you the other . i don t know what you mean , nor do i even desire to know what you mean , replied the cardinal ; but i wish to please you , and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous a creature the more so as you tell me this d artagnan is a <UNK> , a <UNK> , and a traitor . an infamous scoundrel , monseigneur , a scoundrel ! give me paper , a quill , and some ink , then , said the cardinal .: 70.95
<S> any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous robe of office and the rich lace , or who gazed on that pale brow , bent in anxious meditation , might , in the solitude of that apartment , combined with the silence of the ante chambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landing place , have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt .: 268.51
<S> dead ? no , dying . saddled ? yes , saddled and bridled . then we are upon the fugitives . courage , we have them ! but if they are numerous , observed mousqueton , tis not we who have them , but they who have us . nonsense ! cried d artagnan , they ll suppose us to be stronger than themselves , as we re in pursuit ; they ll be afraid and will disperse . certainly , remarked porthos .: 109.26
<S> my voluntary confession of the assassination at auteuil proved to him that i had not committed that of which i stood accused .: 149.49
<S> they are indeed exquisite , he said ; but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of <UNK> a <UNK> which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish i prefer my own specific . undoubtedly , and so should i prefer it , after the effects i have seen produced ; but of course it is a secret , and i am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you . but i , said monte cristo , rising as he spoke i am gallant enough to offer it you . <UNK> how kind you are . only remember one thing a small dose is a remedy , a large one is poison .: 140.54
<S> when franz had once again set foot on shore , he forgot , for the moment at least , the events which had just passed , while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence , and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion , who was awaiting him at rome .: 67.32
<S> i dragged myself toward the bed , to seek the only defense i had left my saving knife ; but i could not reach the <UNK> .: 109.51
<S> monte cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it ; but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint .: 84.36
<S> stay ! said d artagnan ; and taking out his handkerchief , he gagged him .: 26.89
<S> it was , as we have said , the 1st of march , and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness .: 31.73
<S> you are gathering your crop , sir ? said monte cristo , smiling .: 31.97
<S> i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight .: 329.68
<S> d artagnan , that man of iron , who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only , had struck him with admiration .: 65.76
<S> there are twenty five bottles of it left ; all the rest were broken by my fall .: 77.86
<S> you have never seen our <UNK> , count ? said albert .: 42.01
<S> at last , with a horrible splash , he darted like an arrow into the ice cold water , and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry , stifled in a moment by his <UNK> beneath the waves .: 118.54
<S> excuse my not coming to meet you ; but , added he , looking at d artagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness , you know what has happened to me ? no . has the host told you nothing , then ? i asked after you , and came up as soon as i could . porthos seemed to breathe more freely .: 38.53
<S> it seemed to explain to him the change in athos ; a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this <UNK> existence .: 142.71
<S> i believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits , he makes fowls eat <UNK> , and <UNK> the spinal marrow out of dogs with <UNK> . and he is made a member of the academy of sciences for this ? no ; of the french academy . but what has the french academy to do with all this ? i was going to tell you .: 156.69
<S> she is a foreigner a stranger .: 46.84
<S> at once dante s resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion , and to remember that what has once been done may be done again .: 102.19
<S> then , when he thought i had said all , he advanced toward me ; i sprang toward the table , i seized a knife , i placed it to my breast .: 38.81
<S> now , <UNK> all that , i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl ! handsome , certainly , replied albert , but not to my taste , which i confess , <UNK> to something softer , gentler , and more feminine . ah , well , exclaimed cha teau renaud , who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend , you young people are never satisfied ; why , what would you have more ?: 153.43
<S> in that hotel ?: 160.54
<S> the young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw , with a certain degree of inquietude , that it was leveled in his direction ; but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless , he threw himself upon the ground .: 37.70
<S> and where will your worship drink ? there , answered the traveler , pointing to the table .: 35.98
<S> i do not say more , relying on you as you may rely on me .: 41.98
<S> thus louis xiii .: 48.40
<S> but you guess it now , do you not ? or , rather , you remember it ?: 36.84
<S> adieu , count , till to morrow . but the night is dark , said athos , perceiving that lord de winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear ; and you have no servant . i have tony , a safe if simple youth . halloo , there , grimaud , olivain , and blaisois !: 91.24
<S> no , the sound of a bell , announcing a visitor , will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilian s situation , and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise . monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning , he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow ; the glass was shivered to atoms , then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel , who had been writing at his desk , bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window .: 79.33
<S> there , as in every spot where monte cristo stopped , if but for two days , luxury <UNK> and life went on with the utmost ease .: 161.78
<S> it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit , for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek . it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light . no , valentine , i assure you such is not the case .: 113.19
<S> through the closely fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the pavement , that was all ; but , true parisian as he was , bonacieux could recognize every street by the <UNK> , the signs , and the lamps .: 204.52
<S> this was not enough he must now learn to write .: 85.16
<S> in the morning milady , under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest , sent away the woman who attended her .: 75.80
<S> my faith !: 16.94
<S> who dares to answer for another man , when the wisest , when those most after god s own heart , hesitate to answer for themselves , and who <UNK> himself on the side of the strongest and the most fortunate , to crush the weakest and the most unfortunate . impossible , madame , impossible , murmured felton , who felt to the bottom of his heart the justness of this argument .: 140.60
<S> why does he go in secret ?: 63.15
<S> but now answer me .: 116.75
<S> the baroness did not wait for a repetition ; she ran to her husband , who immediately hastened to his agent , and ordered him to sell at any price .: 47.49
<S> i remember too well .: 28.07
<S> the friend of my greatest foes ?: 150.03
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> then i forgive you , said the man , <UNK> his cloak , and advancing to the light .: 43.88
<S> richest , my dear fellow ! and d artagnan <UNK> the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket .: 66.01
<S> gimblou , another bottle . the bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideration d artagnan enjoyed in the establishment .: 220.27
<S> a man wishes to see monsieur at home , replied bazin .: 69.57
<S> so , said charles , he who knocks down there is the comte de la fere , sire , said aramis .: 36.99
<S> in devotedness , or rather in fanaticism , what his <UNK> had been to henry iii. , and his scotch guard to louis xi .: 338.69
<S> in all other respects she was the same mad creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make them proverbial for eccentricity in her family .: 210.75
<S> nor was this all .: 135.30
<S> now , would anybody think that this room contained a happy , merry party , who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away ? ah , sighed caderousse , a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married . the truth is , replied dante s , that i am too happy for noisy mirth ; if that is what you meant by your observation , my worthy friend , you are right ; joy takes a strange effect at times , it seems to <UNK> us almost the same as sorrow . danglars looked towards fernand , whose <UNK> nature received and betrayed each fresh impression .: 121.95
<S> you give away horses worth a thousand louis ; you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty ; under the name of major black you run <UNK> ridden by tiny urchins not larger than <UNK> ; then , when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory , instead of setting any value on it , you give it to the first handsome woman you think of ! and who has filled your head with all this nonsense ? why , in the first place , i heard it from madame danglars , who , by the by , is dying to see you in her box , or to have you seen there by others ; secondly , i learned it from beauchamp s journal ; and <UNK> , from my own imagination .: 153.23
<S> athos gave raoul some of the holy water .: 137.13
<S> i believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for his . the rascal is rich , then ? some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twenty five and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more . hum ! said gondy , laughing ; i was not aware my alms were so well invested . in the meantime they were advancing toward the square , and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and <UNK> his brush .: 104.78
<S> i am rich enough , forsooth , to distribute his authority on this occasion . the count recalled baptistin , who had left the room after delivering the letter .: 62.20
<S> danglars watched these preparations and his mouth watered .: 183.19
<S> the more they are persecuted , the more she thinks of them ; and often , when they least expect it , they have proof of a kind remembrance . alas ! said milady , i believe so ; the queen is so good ! oh , you know her , then , that lovely and noble queen , that you speak of her thus ! cried the novice , with enthusiasm .: 64.74
<S> no ; still there , but i only speak of him in order that i may introduce the name of another man .: 32.66
<S> no !: 15.96
<S> from his eminence , cardinal mazarin , presenting a letter .: 70.60
<S> really , i never saw such an <UNK> for music ; it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion . debray smiled .: 82.05
<S> maximilian crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards .: 118.60
<S> he fancied that they buried the dead at the cha teau d if , and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner , he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders , but unfortunately their arrangements at the cha teau frustrated his projects .: 97.86
<S> one of the forty methods of escape of the duc de beaufort .: 43.62
<S> you will be here at half past nine . and i shall find your eminence ready ? certainly , quite ready . well , then , it is a settled thing ; and now , my lord , will you obtain for me an audience with the queen ? for what purpose ? i wish to receive her majesty s commands from her own lips . she desired me to give them to you . she may have forgotten something . you really wish to see her ? it is indispensable , my lord . mazarin hesitated for one instant , but d artagnan was firm .: 36.18
<S> the two friends met her in the corridor , greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events ; she called some of the <UNK> , who against all <UNK> custom found themselves in the presence of five men .: 147.33
<S> tis i really i !: 113.53
<S> they then summoned their friends , who , with blaisois , mousqueton and grimaud , promptly joined them , leaving parry behind them , who was to take back to london the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys , which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him .: 72.00
<S> ah ! said the king , i was unjust ; here is a creature that loves me .: 32.73
<S> the cries died away in groans , and next morning , as soon as wasilio s wife could muster up courage to venture abroad , she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities , when assunta , although dreadfully burnt , was found still breathing ; every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open , and the money stolen .: 287.82
<S> at eight o clock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled , and lord de winter and his friends <UNK> that they must prepare for the expedition .: 47.85
<S> good evening , maximilian ; i know i have kept you waiting , but you saw the cause of my delay . yes , i recognized mademoiselle danglars .: 35.46
<S> behind d artagnan entered porthos , aramis , lord de winter , and the man in the red cloak .: 28.49
<S> what happened then ? she asked .: 27.47
<S> there it is , all blood stained , on the desk , as a testimony of the crime . ah , very good . hush , gentlemen , here is the court ; let us go back to our places . a noise was heard in the hall ; the sergeant called his two <UNK> with an energetic hem ! and the door keeper appearing , called out with that shrill voice peculiar to his order , ever since the days of beaumarchais : the court , gentlemen ! chapter 110 .: 120.65
<S> for me ? said d artagnan ; are you sure of that ? pardieu , monsieur , i can t be more sure .: 20.70
<S> pardon me , my god ; receive me , oh , my lord ! caderousse sighed deeply , and fell back with a groan .: 27.70
<S> nonsense , let us break open the door , and if he is too far gone in his madness , well , we will kill him ! softly , gentlemen ! said d artagnan , drawing his pistols from his belt , you will kill nobody , if you please ! good , good ! cried the calm voice of athos , from the other side of the door , let them just come in , these <UNK> of little children , and we shall see ! brave as they appeared to be , the two english gentlemen looked at each other hesitatingly .: 56.83
<S> you do not make raoul work , so he takes his own way of employing himself . exactly ; therefore i think of sending him away from here . you will be wise to do so . no doubt of it ; but it will break his heart .: 69.76
<S> still , replied porthos .: 21.90
<S> he felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy <UNK> his heart .: 89.08
<S> i ? said milady , with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment .: 39.92
<S> the officer who commanded the post of the red cross was sent for , and by successive inquiries they learned that athos was then lodged in fort l eve que .: 122.64
<S> what have you done with monsieur de beaufort ? he is in vendome , where he will wait until i write to him to return to paris . write to him ; now s the time . you are sure of your enterprise ? yes , but he must make haste ; for hardly will the people of paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead them .: 71.05
<S> really , count , you have a delightful way of setting people at their ease . indeed , you give me more credit than i deserve ; i only wish to do what will be agreeable to you , that is all . when shall you send your invitations ? this very day . well , i will immediately call on m. danglars , and tell him that my mother and myself must leave paris tomorrow .: 48.12
<S> well , the fact is , morrel , i was thinking that i too am weary of life , and since an opportunity presents itself stay ! said the young man .: 65.95
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> oh , no , athos .: 19.19
<S> i do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man ; but leave us , i pray you . the baron went out sobbing .: 53.44
<S> in a week , remember , you will no longer be performing your <UNK> for practice , but on a field of battle . then suddenly , in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation : see , raoul ! he resumed ; what a fine plain for <UNK> shooting . the young man stored in his mind the <UNK> whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed .: 183.88
<S> it was for this reason , as he said to those around him , that he had put on his cloak ; and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully , all admired his embroidered baldric , and d artagnan more than anyone .: 73.07
<S> it was a night of joy and terror , such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime .: 104.87
<S> at nine o clock the night had fully come .: 27.02
<S> d artagnan !: 11.49
<S> you were asking , then ? said the host in spanish .: 37.80
<S> good !: 24.94
<S> that instant the arm of porthos fell .: 67.09
<S> at what ? said milady , with the utmost ingenuousness .: 51.40
<S> how pale you are ! no , but i have just met with a terrible adventure !: 32.22
<S> i never go there . why , what in the world , cried aramis , is that animal bazin doing ?: 92.47
<S> monsieur d artagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned , said athos , bowing with great dignity .: 49.06
<S> monte cristo , turned round hastily , and saw madame de morcerf at the entrance of the salon , at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered , pale and motionless ; when monte cristo turned round , she let fall her arm , which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded door post .: 50.79
<S> napoleon is the mahomet of the west , and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers , not only as a leader and <UNK> , but also as the <UNK> of equality . he ! cried the marquise : napoleon the type of equality !: 260.96
<S> albert de morcerf to return to paris , and franz d e pinay to pass a fortnight at venice .: 47.16
<S> albert , she said , in a voice which was altered by emotion , i have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances .: 77.34
<S> lord winter s tent was pitched by the side of the royal <UNK> , a kind of corridor communicating between the two .: 138.78
<S> the councillor placed himself at the window ; the street was completely deserted , but in the distance was heard , like the noise of the tide rushing in , the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around notre dame .: 88.67
<S> you saw the child pass through the rue richelieu last year , who amused himself with killing his brothers and <UNK> by <UNK> pins in their ears while they slept .: 264.00
<S> is it not so , father ? the old man made a sign in the affirmative .: 13.73
<S> and by whom were they recommended to you ? oh , by the house of <UNK> , one of the best in florence . i do not mean to say you will lose , but , nevertheless , mind you hold to the terms of the agreement . would you not trust the cavalcanti ? i ?: 64.04
<S> read me her letter . oh , my lord ! said laporte .: 31.60
<S> just then the sound of finger nails slightly grating against the door of the library informed valentine that the count was still watching , and recommended her to do the same ; at the same time , on the opposite side , that is towards edward s room , valentine fancied that she heard the creaking of the floor ; she listened attentively , holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated ; the lock turned , and the door slowly opened .: 65.89
<S> i will answer them both , and contrary to the usual method , the last first , because it is the least difficult .: 53.02
<S> i repent of it ?: 85.42
<S> i know that you belong to the cardinal , but belong to me as well , and i will take upon myself the making of your fortune .: 24.90
<S> the storm of last night overtook us at cape morgiou , and we were <UNK> on these rocks . where do you come from ? from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost .: 179.48
<S> as the stranger asked the question , he dragged the table beneath the window .: 48.07
<S> yes , it is an extraordinary story , said beauchamp ; is it not ? it is absurd , said debray .: 19.92
<S> and follow me wherever i go ? to the world s end . then take my arm , and let us on ; we have no time to lose . the young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her , for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome , proud , and powerful as a god .: 55.76
<S> at length , about the hour the governor had appointed , footsteps were heard on the stairs .: 70.17
<S> d artagnan , being the bearer of the letter , is naturally the head of the enterprise ; let him decide , and we will execute . well , said d artagnan , i decide that we should adopt athos s plan , and that we set off in half an hour . agreed ! shouted the three musketeers in chorus .: 41.46
<S> i have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco , in a small chest in the hold , which you shall have tomorrow .: 203.56
<S> peppino had a little spare time , so he had a game of <UNK> with the <UNK> , lost three crowns , and then to console himself drank a bottle of orvieto .: 139.55
<S> gondy continued his way and went as far as the tour de <UNK> .: 109.17
<S> the count is in fashion ; i congratulate him upon it . and have you replied to everyone as you have to me ? ah , to be sure , i have not answered you ; be satisfied , we shall have this lion ; we are among the privileged ones . were you at the opera yesterday ? no . he was there . ah , indeed ?: 49.52
<S> carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him .: 73.31
<S> now , here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse , but that he did not .: 59.85
<S> the count of monte cristo ? cried morrel , throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage ; i should think we would see him .: 33.02
<S> then he thought it was time to make the last trial , and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria , and without having occasion to force open his jaws , which had remained extended , he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat .: 61.37
<S> they then dressed themselves .: 102.58
<S> as for me , i play my game <UNK> , fairly , and above board , as i always do .: 125.60
<S> and so being , beautiful , witty , somewhat talented , as the <UNK> <UNK> say , and rich and that is happiness , sir why do you call me unhappy ? danglars , seeing his daughter smiling , and proud even to insolence , could not entirely repress his brutal feelings , but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation .: 199.47
<S> we have experienced the ingratitude of the great , as you well know . tis true , replied d artagnan .: 31.12
<S> come back , sirs , back . the two youths looked at each other , and at this moment a pistol shot and cries for help were heard .: 49.38
<S> the journey chapter <UNK> .: 80.48
<S> well , said he , was i mistaken ? she has answered you ! cried franz .: 25.06
<S> villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart .: 61.12
<S> proceed , she said .: 20.56
<S> the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him .: 21.47
<S> the abbe told me it was worth 50,000 francs , muttered caderousse .: 26.19
<S> but that is not all after rescuing me from the sword , he rescued me from the cold , not by sharing his cloak with me , like st. martin , but by giving me the whole ; then from hunger by sharing with me guess what ? a strasbourg pie ? asked beauchamp .: 188.09
<S> what do you say ? i say that love is a <UNK> in which he who wins , wins death !: 106.83
<S> go , he added , and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee , and tell him that you suit me in all respects . grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy .: 84.53
<S> i dreamed that i saw you lying bleeding , wounded . in the left side , was it not , and with a knife ? interrupted buckingham .: 90.76
<S> the pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her domination .: 156.91
<S> i hate the english they are coarse , like every nation that <UNK> beer . would it be better to remain here , said athos , and take a turn in the bastile or the dungeon of vincennes for having favored the escape of monsieur de beaufort ?: 128.30
<S> suddenly a terrible cry , a cry of despair , was wafted through space ; and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds , the veil which hid the moon was <UNK> away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light .: 142.60
<S> you are there , sir ? he said , respectfully .: 15.71
<S> the young men first approached the dead man .: 32.96
<S> he watched the effect of this question on the old man .: 39.52
<S> at this moment planchet brought out athos s horse ; the musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle .: 40.98
<S> d artagnan , whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with , had not whatever interest he had in <UNK> his curiosity on this subject been able to assign any cause for these fits , or for the periods of their recurrence .: 212.19
<S> he arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation .: 172.58
<S> my sister thanks you for your good and eternal remembrance .: 150.07
<S> it was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a number of the <UNK> at the same spot , but a concerted organized attack .: 92.81
<S> my lord , said d artagnan , your eminence sees that we wish to act with all formality and due respect ; but i must warn you that we have no time to lose ; open the door then , my lord , and be so good as to remember , once for all , that on the slightest attempt to escape or the <UNK> cry for help , our position being very critical indeed , you must not be angry with us if we go to extremities . be assured , answered mazarin , that i shall attempt nothing ; i give you my word of honor . d artagnan made a sign to porthos to redouble his watchfulness ; then turning to mazarin : now , my lord , let us enter , if you please . chapter <UNK> .: 53.06
<S> planchet , grimaud , mousqueton , and bazin set off at full speed .: 29.25
<S> it looks as if you were trying to fleece me ? i ?: 84.26
<S> m. morrel paid the expenses of his funeral , and a few small debts the poor old man had contracted .: 149.18
<S> his devotion , and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes , produced the effect they always produce on noble minds merce de s had always had a sincere regard for fernand , and this was now <UNK> by gratitude .: 203.44
<S> well , sir , said madame de saint me ran , after a few minutes reflection , i must hasten the marriage , for i have but a short time to live . you , madame ? you , dear mamma ? exclaimed m. de villefort and valentine at the same time .: 22.97
<S> the king , too , who had listened in the greatest agony , now breathed again .: 79.02
<S> the instant the letter was written , carlini seized it , and hastened to the plain to find a messenger .: 63.81
<S> he approached the dying man , and , leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look , he whispered , i am i am and his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it .: 77.07
<S> avenge me of that infamous de wardes , said milady , between her teeth , and i shall soon know how to get rid of you you double idiot , you animated sword blade ! fall voluntarily into my arms , hypocritical and dangerous woman , said d artagnan , likewise to himself , after having abused me with such effrontery , and afterward i will laugh at you with him whom you wish me to kill . d artagnan lifted up his head .: 116.53
<S> then he stepped into his coupe , calm and smiling , and was at home in five minutes .: 33.40
<S> he was a man of twenty five or twenty six years of age , of <UNK> countenance , <UNK> to his superiors , insolent to his subordinates ; and this , in addition to his position as responsible agent on board , which is always <UNK> to the sailors , made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dante s was beloved by them .: 77.92
<S> and if i give you this password , said she , would you forget it as soon as you used it ? by my honor , by the faith of a gentleman ! said d artagnan , with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake it .: 32.84
<S> he saw in fancy the burial of his father , and the marriage of merce de s .: 33.87
<S> this brought back to franz , in spite of himself , the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g , and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire .: 62.16
<S> your voice is that of a young man . i do not know my age , for i have not counted the years i have been here .: 29.89
<S> a servant , wearing a livery of considerable style and richness , appeared at the threshold , and , placing two cards in the landlord s hands , who forthwith presented them to the two young men , he said : please to deliver these , from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morcerf and m. franz d e pinay .: 64.85
<S> but you expected some one then ? asked the officer .: 45.43
<S> at this order , given in athos s habitually calm manner , the face of the gascon relaxed and porthos s brow grew smooth .: 177.39
<S> are you still resolved to accompany me ? more determined than ever . well , then , come along . franz and the count went downstairs , accompanied by peppino .: 56.67
<S> it was nearly three days since i had eaten or drunk anything .: 47.13
<S> to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious , that the interest they had felt for the count s safety became now quite a secondary matter .: 113.09
<S> it was an illuminated book , with beautiful gothic characters , and so weighty with gold , that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity .: 233.31
<S> from time to time a dull sound was heard , like that of a rising tempest or a <UNK> of the sea ; but nothing clear , nothing distinct , nothing intelligible ; it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an <UNK> .: 198.64
<S> then , when he raised it again , he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate air .: 23.04
<S> it was like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart , and then <UNK> through his whole body .: 131.32
<S> athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him , but the man refused .: 71.35
<S> has <UNK> re , that <UNK> of the south , been killed ?: 405.83
<S> the foundation s business office is located at 809 north 1500 west , salt lake city , ut 84116 , 801 596 1887 .: 193.45
<S> d artagnan , you are a great man ; and when you occupy monsieur de tre ville s place , i will come and ask your influence to secure me an abbey . well , i am in a maze , said porthos ; do you approve of what d artagnan has done ? parbleu ! indeed i do , said athos ; i not only approve of what he has done , but i congratulate him upon it . and now , gentlemen , said d artagnan , without stopping to explain his conduct to porthos , all for one , one for all that is our motto , is it not ? and yet said porthos .: 41.85
<S> i have it , gentlemen ; the right idea has just occurred to me . tell us . allow me to give grimaud some indispensable orders . athos made a sign for his lackey to approach .: 73.14
<S> edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was , without the owner knowing who he was ; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pump him , they extracted nothing more from him ; he gave <UNK> <UNK> of naples and malta , which he knew as well as marseilles , and held stoutly to his first story .: 188.96
<S> to wait , replied athos .: 24.53
<S> well , then , all is settled ; you are to set off , said the cardinal .: 18.02
<S> during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france , the parisians , finding themselves one morning without either queen or king , were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted , and the absence of mazarin , a thing so long desired , did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives .: 151.73
<S> on my honor , in one single throw . but having lost the horses , i am particularly anxious to preserve the harnesses . stake your diamond , then . this ?: 94.66
<S> i asked the price ; they told me it was 4,500 francs .: 73.85
<S> while he was endeavoring to calm his fears , and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams , was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home , in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept , the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard , then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs , followed by tears and lamentations , such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master s grief .: 159.63
<S> to be sure we will , replied aramis and porthos , with admirable promptness and decision , as if that were the simplest thing in the world , to be sure we will get you out ; but meantime , as we are to set off the day after tomorrow , you would do much better not to risk this bastille . let us do better than that , said athos ; do not let us leave him during the whole evening .: 45.78
<S> grant me this poor wretch s life .: 106.36
<S> sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success ; but internally he was deeply wounded , and his self love immensely piqued , to think that albert de morcerf , the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day , should thus be passed over , and merely have his labor for his pains .: 164.05
<S> danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair , and it is of m. de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation . albert turned .: 52.15
<S> as to the other , he knows me , he fears me , and knows what he has to expect of me if ever i escape from his hands .: 47.40
<S> it was seven o clock in the morning , and daylight began to appear .: 17.08
<S> remained alone , and turning his eyes on his half opened horace , muttered : <UNK> et <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . m. de blacas returned as <UNK> as he had departed , but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king s authority .: 231.21
<S> what do you want with me ? said she .: 5.86
<S> they still laugh at them in france , and yet always wear them , for all that . very well , very well , said the major , who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the count .: 70.17
<S> but since you possess that virtue , why the devil don t you make use of it with respect to her majesty ?: 48.67
<S> that gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life . who are those gentlemen ? asked danglars of monte cristo .: 35.21
<S> accept that which the bearer brings you ; make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman , and think of me , who kisses tenderly your black eyes .: 241.65
<S> ah , ah ! said he , she is asleep ; that s well .: 15.85
<S> he spoke in a voice of the procureur general , with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the law .: 142.82
<S> if he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor , and perhaps the liberty , of the lady of his thoughts , as he says , i will answer for it he will look twice . and yet , said milady , with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged , if he persists ? if he persists ? said the cardinal .: 50.06
<S> i looked into the kitchen once more and saw caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs ; his back was turned towards me , so that i could not see the expression of his countenance neither should i have been able to do so had he been placed differently , as his head was buried between his two hands .: 107.96
<S> how many shots ? a hundred . that s quite as many as we shall want .: 86.39
<S> bonacieux dead , and to d artagnan , whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life .: 46.06
<S> but the story of the <UNK> made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside .: 108.14
<S> ah , my head ! oh , what agony ! shall i suffer like this long ? no , no , friend , replied the doctor , you will soon cease to suffer . ah , i understand you , said the unhappy man .: 34.33
<S> athos threw a piece of money to the <UNK> to withdraw .: 60.08
<S> a captain is nothing but a father of a family , charged with even a greater responsibility than the father of an ordinary family .: 83.20
<S> d artagnan therefore returned to the rue fe rou .: 9.85
<S> perhaps never in her life had this woman , who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions , felt her heart beat so violently .: 133.01
<S> why , one of them is a rich lord from touraine and the other a knight of malta , of noble family .: 81.87
<S> pardon me , i had no intention of committing an indiscretion . indiscretion , oh , you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject .: 111.75
<S> that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation .: 69.08
<S> dante s easily recognized them , faria had so often drawn them for him .: 70.24
<S> did you fancy yourself dying ? no , i had no such idea ; but , knowing that all was ready for flight , i thought you might have made your escape . the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dante s .: 70.52
<S> one might have fancied that athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event .: 110.66
<S> <UNK> di <UNK> !: 8499.87
<S> is it you , mordaunt ? said cromwell , the cloud passing away from his face ; since you are here , it is well ; you may remain . i come to congratulate you . to congratulate me what for ? on the capture of charles stuart .: 65.03
<S> at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared ; then the queen , with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents , repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject .: 70.87
<S> end of the port wine mystery .: 450.70
<S> they have abducted her , added the commissary ; and do you know the man who has committed this deed ? i think i know him . who is he ? remember that i affirm nothing , monsieur the commissary , and that i only suspect . whom do you suspect ?: 51.43
<S> now , it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess . two years ! exclaimed dante s ; do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time ? not their application , certainly , but their principles you may ; to learn is not to know ; there are the <UNK> and the learned .: 105.02
<S> thanks , my dear friend , said madame danglars , trying to smile ; it is over now , and i am much better . chapter 64 .: 23.18
<S> a last discharge welcomed them , but did not stop them ; they jumped into the ditch , and prepared to scale the breach .: 85.20
<S> except your signature and your partner s , m. morrel . and why should he not have this ? asked the owner ; he is young , it is true , but he seems to me a thorough seaman , and of full experience . a cloud passed over danglars brow .: 78.75
<S> she was said to have a weak chest , and like <UNK> in the <UNK> violin , she would die one day while singing .: 188.18
<S> the count soon mastered the <UNK> , the gate opened , and he then found himself in a little garden , about twenty feet long by twelve wide , bounded on one side by part of the hedge , which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate , and on the other by the old tower , covered with <UNK> and studded with wall flowers .: 121.14
<S> i have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write .: 79.82
<S> and now eat and drink ; i will entertain you tonight .: 64.14
<S> fire , then , said athos .: 20.30
<S> perhaps , when all is considered , you are right .: 34.92
<S> do not fear that you put me to inconvenience ; if i want money i can send for some to any of my <UNK> ; at bracieux alone , i have twenty thousand francs in gold .: 84.86
<S> are you ill ? sir , i am very hungry , replied mouston .: 31.89
<S> d artagnan did not know london ; he did not know a word of english ; but he wrote the name of buckingham on a piece of paper , and everyone pointed out to him the way to the duke s ho tel .: 28.02
<S> it is a miracle , it is a providence that we have not been discovered .: 24.75
<S> perhaps some day they will want to make you king , instead of the prince of wales , or the duke of york , your elder brothers .: 114.03
<S> the money is nothing ; that letter was everything .: 63.46
<S> greet each other , then ; and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads . rochefort and d artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips ; but the cardinal was there , observing them with his vigilant eye .: 108.73
<S> athos recognized his comrade , and phlegmatic as he was , he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyes <UNK> falling over his shoes , sleeves <UNK> up , and mustaches stiff with agitation .: 230.18
<S> now look here , i want something to eat !: 65.73
<S> when i returned to paris , i learned that you , the widow of m. de nargonne , had married m. danglars .: 29.82
<S> at this moment he will have left elba , to go whither i know not , but assuredly to attempt a landing either at naples , or on the coast of tuscany , or perhaps on the shores of france .: 70.84
<S> where are you going ? oh , fear not , said maximilian , stopping at a short distance , i do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me .: 63.15
<S> soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around them then , at last , the volcano was extinguished then all was dark and still the floating bark and heaving ocean .: 357.57
<S> what prevents you from being so ? oh , it will be too great a disappointment to my father if i do not marry mademoiselle danglars . marry her then , said the count , with a significant shrug of the shoulders .: 54.27
<S> nay , i know not ; some evidence required from us , perhaps . may it not be about that cursed affair ? asked aramis , in which case i do not greatly care to go , for it will be to pocket a lecture ; and since it is my <UNK> to give them to others i am rather <UNK> to receiving them myself . if it were so , answered athos , we should not be taken there by lord de winter , for he would come in for his share ; he was one of us . you re right ; yes , let us go . on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first ; indeed , there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate .: 69.72
<S> my dear sir , he said , hastily , do you know if the count is within ? yes , your excellency ; he has this moment returned . is he in bed ? i should say no . then ring at his door , if you please , and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience . signor pastrini did as he was desired , and returning five minutes after , he said : the count awaits your excellency . franz went along the corridor , and a servant introduced him to the count .: 38.70
<S> however much of a jew he may be , he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles .: 69.60
<S> it is a very cold one , my dear friend , said aramis .: 11.90
<S> four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners .: 85.87
<S> do you not think , on reflection , said he to him , that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your mother in law in the presence of m. debray ? my dear count , said morcerf , i beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely . now , speaking without any exaggeration , is your mother really so very much <UNK> to this marriage ? so much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house , and my mother , has not , i think , visited madame danglars twice in her whole life . then , said the count , i am emboldened to speak openly to you .: 62.84
<S> ah , sir , said caderousse with a sigh , it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man ; but in this world a man does not <UNK> the better for being honest . the abbe fixed on him a searching , penetrating glance .: 46.40
<S> the door of the back staircase opened , then the side gate of the garden , and ali and his master were on the spot with lights .: 56.60
<S> have they then offered a large one ? inquired cromwell .: 85.92
<S> oh , those <UNK> are an accursed race ! truly they are , murmured the count in a lugubrious tone .: 114.72
<S> never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now , and if it was not a sublime , it was , at least , a curious spectacle .: 80.74
<S> that will do , replied the cardinal .: 19.57
<S> give it me , that i may see it is not false . there it is . the child put the piece of money into his pocket .: 49.93
<S> yes , said he .: 5.77
<S> i will not die alone i will not ! and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast , and striving desperately to break the <UNK> that bound his hands .: 176.78
<S> but he had reckoned too much upon his strength , and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him .: 87.08
<S> i could not help thinking so just now ; the idea came over my mind , and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance ; excuse the remark . i do not think it likely , sir ; mademoiselle de villefort is not very fond of society , and we very seldom go out , said the young lady .: 78.05
<S> they are not dead , for the death of d artagnan would make a sensation .: 27.51
<S> what is he himself ? asked madame henrietta .: 30.68
<S> milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation , and asked d artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in england .: 60.57
<S> well , i understand what i now have to do , replied villefort .: 18.43
<S> m. de monte cristo has only shown us kindness .: 48.21
<S> the nocturnal visitor , ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the <UNK> , might now think himself at home , and pursue his purpose with full security .: 138.93
<S> i shall be excused for leaving at daybreak , for i was ashamed . he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper .: 46.89
<S> te deum for the victory of lens .: 107.76
<S> after having been for some time after the death of louis xiii .: 26.81
<S> where is the child ? villefort shrugged his shoulders .: 20.13
<S> but i can not , said she ; i am not strong enough ; do you shut it . ah , you do well to ask , said euge nie , laughing ; i forgot that i was hercules , and you only the pale <UNK> ! and the young girl , kneeling on the top , pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together , and mademoiselle d armilly passed the bolt of the padlock through .: 52.09
<S> bernouin was waiting there , impatient for news of his master .: 90.37
<S> am i not to know to whom to present it ? you will know when you reach london ; at london you may tear off the outer envelope . and what are my instructions ? to obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed .: 88.86
<S> come , said madame danglars , leave music and compliments , and let us go and take tea . come , louise , said mademoiselle danglars to her friend .: 42.82
<S> now , gentlemen , said he , conduct me where you will . turning back again , he said , i thought i saw winter move ; if he still lives , by all you hold most sacred , do not abandon him . never fear , king charles , said mordaunt , the bullet pierced his heart . do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos , said d artagnan to athos and aramis , that you recognize this man , for milady is not dead ; her soul lives in the body of this demon . the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive ; but on the road an aide de camp , from cromwell , sent orders that colonel <UNK> should conduct him to <UNK> castle .: 113.22
<S> she was carried out of the hall , the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off , and madame danglars was recognized .: 52.65
<S> the first card struck off was taken , according to your orders , to the baron danglars , rue de la chausse e d antin , no .: 57.51
<S> he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought , rose , staggered towards it , raised the vessel to his lips , and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure .: 55.65
<S> if it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments , i could even thank you for <UNK> me , for it leaves me a gleam of hope , that if you did not expect me and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose , at least i was in your thoughts .: 99.40
<S> these poor creatures had no bad intentions .: 122.07
<S> of course , we hope that you will support the project gutenberg mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg name associated with the work .: 14.82
<S> <UNK> magistrate and orator of great eloquence chancellor of france under louis xv .: 1660.15
<S> the small and angular head of this man , his white hair and thick gray moustaches , caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin , who had received an exact description of the expected visitor , and who was awaiting him in the hall .: 68.71
<S> it is done , gentlemen , said athos .: 9.56
<S> can not monsieur cromwell wait a little ? yes , but i ? said mordaunt .: 64.65
<S> no one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it .: 127.21
<S> a letter ? said the young man .: 12.44
<S> wealth does not necessarily produce happiness .: 118.95
<S> poor athos ! said he ; he will never guess what all this means .: 35.79
<S> i don t know english , athos , said d artagnan ; but you know it and will interpret for me . then <UNK> their steps they passed the three men , but turned back immediately , and d artagnan walked straight up to the butcher and touching him on the chest with the tip of his finger , said to athos : say this to him in english : you are a coward .: 57.85
<S> we will see , gentlemen , we will see .: 15.39
<S> were i but of gentle birth ! the position of the cardinal was indeed critical , and recent events had added to his difficulties .: 278.10
<S> compie gne , that royal residence and fortified town , is well furnished with authorities , gendarmes , and commissaries of police ; they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived , and the bell and bottle being the best known hotel in the town , they had naturally directed their first inquiries there .: 311.61
<S> my lord , he said , which way do we go ?: 48.54
<S> we have so many <UNK> in the year of grace <UNK> in the entire political world , of which you are one of the leaders . they say that it is quite fair , and that <UNK> so much red , you ought to reap a little blue . come , come , that is not bad ! said lucien .: 88.60
<S> whilst porthos , still in bed , was <UNK> on his cloak for him , a second knock at the door was heard .: 80.58
<S> but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed . how have i deviated from those principles , monsieur ? asked monte cristo , who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity , that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance .: 89.28
<S> if , she said , there is one among you who knows the king , let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there . a man wrapped in a cloak , in the folds of which his face was hidden , approached and leaned over the bed and looked .: 70.67
<S> too long a wait too long . but who will say your excellency has been to monte cristo ? oh , i shall not , cried franz .: 61.15
<S> athos was scarcely aged at all !: 157.82
<S> the affair was described to the messenger with all the <UNK> of enthusiasm .: 84.60
<S> that , however , does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service , as i am to that of your majesty . i ask your pardon for him , cardinal , said the queen ; he is a child , not yet able to understand his obligations to you . the cardinal smiled .: 39.57
<S> monsieur porthos was six feet high ; this man is scarcely five . nevertheless , said d artagnan , the people are bowing very low to this person . as he spoke , he rode toward the tall horse to the man of importance and his valets .: 67.73
<S> he would have pardoned me , he would certainly have pardoned me , if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldric in ambiguous words , it is true , but rather <UNK> ambiguous .: 105.59
<S> and why did you refuse , my son ? inquired the old man .: 11.24
<S> well , sir ? he said .: 9.01
<S> the agitated figures , apparently wild with terror , consisted of groslow , who at the hour fixed by mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors .: 152.23
<S> i am a brute .: 41.03
<S> the article was not inserted by me i was not even aware of it ; but you have , by the step you have taken , called my attention to the paragraph in question , and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so . sir , said albert , rising , i will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you , and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons . certainly , my dear sir . and this evening , if you please , or tomorrow at the latest , we will meet . no , no , i will be on the ground at the proper time ; but in my opinion and i have a right to dictate the preliminaries , as it is i who have received the provocation in my opinion the time ought not to be yet .: 50.85
<S> athos took off his hat , placed it on the end of his sword , and waved it in the air .: 19.38
<S> he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes .: 131.03
<S> the coachman entered and traversed the half circle without <UNK> his speed , and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel .: 122.93
<S> there remains the valise , added porthos .: 88.36
<S> in the corridor he again met the pretty kitty ; that was the name of the soubrette .: 39.72
<S> to what class of society does he belong ? he was a shepherd boy attached to the farm of the count of san felice , situated between palestrina and the lake of <UNK> ; he was born at pampinara , and entered the count s service when he was five years old ; his father was also a shepherd , who owned a small flock , and lived by the <UNK> and the milk , which he sold at rome .: 91.61
<S> the means we might have used , which we in our blindness could not see , then seem simple and easy , and we say , why did i not do this , instead of that ? women , on the contrary , are rarely tormented with remorse ; for the decision does not come from you , your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you , and your faults the results of others crimes . in any case , sir , you will allow , replied madame danglars , that , even if the fault were alone mine , i last night received a severe punishment for it . poor thing , said villefort , pressing her hand , it was too severe for your strength , for you were twice overwhelmed , and yet well ? well , i must tell you .: 84.25
<S> she opened the drawer , and found a key ; and , understanding that was what he wanted , again watched his eyes , which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents .: 91.55
<S> teresa felt a flush pass over her face ; she looked at luigi , who could not refuse his assent .: 52.33
<S> that head has never conspired , murmured he , but it matters not ; we will see . you are accused of high treason , said the cardinal , slowly .: 60.11
<S> would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him ?: 136.86
<S> and when is the wedding to be ? he asked .: 33.37
<S> the opinion of all the commercial men was that , under the reverses which had successively weighed down morrel , it was impossible for him to remain <UNK> .: 141.40
<S> she will soon get over these things . so saying , madame de saint me ran extended her dry bony hand to villefort , who , while <UNK> a son in law s respectful salute on it , looked at rene e , as much as to say , i must try and fancy tis your dear hand i kiss , as it should have been . these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal , sighed poor rene e .: 151.38
<S> oh , if i had my three friends here , cried he , i should have , at least , some hopes of finding her ; but who knows what has become of them ? it was past midnight ; the next thing was to find planchet .: 40.85
<S> do what i tell you , and <UNK> awaits you ! villefort fell on his knees .: 60.82
<S> do not call anyone do not be alarmed , said the count ; do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast ; the man standing before you , valentine for this time it is no ghost , is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of . valentine could not reply ; the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room , alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable ; still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire , if your intentions are pure , why are you here ? the count s marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girl s mind .: 88.53
<S> as we used to say when we said good bye to each other in the late cardinal s time . athos waved his hand , raoul bowed , and d artagnan and planchet set out .: 54.21
<S> this is what i shall do ; i will wait until the very moment you are married , for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us , since m. franz may , after all , die before that time , a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it , nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die , and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned .: 104.08
<S> d artagnan at first took these weapons for foils , and believed them to be buttoned ; but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened , and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators , but even the actors themselves , laughed like so many madmen .: 189.35
<S> with discretion d artagnan remained behind ; but at the moment when buckingham crossed the threshold , he turned round , and seeing the hesitation of the young man , come in ! cried he , and if you have the good fortune to be admitted to her majesty s presence , tell her what you have seen . encouraged by this invitation , d artagnan followed the duke , who closed the door after them .: 43.41
<S> he rose in his turn , and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats , with which the carriage was filled , cast them with all the force and skill he was master of .: 55.35
<S> you ve missed me , cried aramis , but i swear to heaven !: 45.32
<S> yesterday , for two hours , i was at the church of saint <UNK> du roule , and for two hours i prayed most fervently .: 126.96
<S> my mother , cried mordaunt , with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint , i can only offer thee one victim , but it shall at any rate be the one thou <UNK> thyself have chosen ! and whilst d artagnan uttered a cry , porthos raised the oar , and aramis sought a place to strike , a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated athos into the sea ; whilst mordaunt , with a shout of triumph , grasped the neck of his victim , and in order to paralyze his movements , twined arms and legs around the musketeer .: 141.22
<S> but this vessel which , like the pharaon , came from calcutta , had been in for a fortnight , while no intelligence had been received of the pharaon .: 74.89
<S> how did the honor or disgrace of m. de morcerf affect me ?: 88.95
<S> mademoiselle , said the stranger , one day you will receive a letter signed sinbad the sailor . do exactly what the letter bids you , however strange it may appear . yes , sir , returned julie .: 80.09
<S> and now , your excellency , he added , bowing his head , you know everything you are my judge on earth , as the almighty is in heaven ; have you for me no words of consolation ? my good friend , i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abbe busoni .: 41.27
<S> for the last year my faithful highlanders have fought for honor alone . athos smiled .: 178.53
<S> oh , tis here tis here tis over my sight is gone my senses fail !: 716.13
<S> limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it , you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from .: 64.56
<S> i shall gain it , for the hope of the nation and the spirit of the lord are with me .: 44.08
<S> at one of the extremities of the camp , near an immense tent , in which the <UNK> officers were holding a kind of council , presided over by lord leven , their commander , a man attired as a cavalier lay sleeping on the turf , his right hand extended over his sword .: 130.06
<S> far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen , all <UNK> to their utmost height to try and see .: 154.62
<S> baron , have you any report more recent than this , dated the 20th february , and this is the 3rd of march ? no , sire , but i am hourly expecting one ; it may have arrived since i left my office . go thither , and if there be none well , well , continued louis xviii. , make one ; that is the usual way , is it not ? and the king laughed <UNK> .: 103.86
<S> the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund .: 79.85
<S> at the expiration of ten minutes aramis arrived , accompanied by grimaud and eight or ten followers .: 46.07
<S> besides , his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies , but without meanness or weakness , fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind , when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened if conquered , he doubles the triumph of his antagonist ; if a conqueror , he is accused of foul play and want of courage .: 316.34
<S> but you know how the theologians in their <UNK> chairs , and philosophers in their <UNK> , occasionally say cruel truths ; let us suppose for the moment that we are <UNK> in a social way , or even philosophically , and i will say to you , rude as it may seem , my brother , you sacrifice greatly to pride ; you may be above others , but above you there is god . <UNK> above us all , sir , was monte cristo s response , in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that villefort involuntarily shuddered .: 187.71
<S> anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy .: 67.62
<S> then another error seized me on seeing you in company with these gentlemen i was afraid you were dangerously ill. the two men in black , who guessed d artagnan s meaning , darted at him a glance which might have been thought threatening ; but d artagnan took no heed of it .: 98.76
<S> come , said andrea , you are a man void of compassion ; i ll have you turned out . this made the keeper turn around , and he burst into a loud laugh .: 53.49
<S> i hear no balls whistle , and i see nobody ! they are firing at the corpses , replied athos .: 102.38
<S> then he added aloud , yes , sir , i am hungry very hungry . and your excellency wants something to eat ? at once , if possible nothing easier , said peppino .: 60.99
<S> the accusation ? no ; the letter . are you sure ? i saw it done . that alters the case .: 74.42
<S> and the coadjutor and madame de longueville ; and if the worthy broussel were there , whom you so stupidly helped arrest , i should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks . well , sir , i will obey you , although i do not understand you . it is unnecessary for you to understand .: 62.93
<S> our expedition lasted nearly six weeks ; we had been to lucca to take in oil , to leghorn for english cottons , and we ran our cargo without opposition , and returned home full of joy .: 269.29
<S> at this point grimaud stopped and was preparing to make a hole with his gimlet , when he found a spigot ; he therefore placed his tankard under it and turned the <UNK> ; something , whatever it was the cask contained , fell silently into the tankard .: 163.66
<S> look at that large clumsy bed , hung with such gloomy , blood colored drapery !: 250.62
<S> he has deceived her in her love , humbled her in her pride , thwarted her in her ambition ; and now he ruins her fortune , deprives her of liberty , and even threatens her life .: 88.68
<S> but , cried anne of austria , tired of these vague attacks , but , sire , you do not tell me all that you have in your heart .: 43.19
<S> both . raoul went out , and when athos heard his young , joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain , he sighed .: 102.39
<S> half an hour after the entrance of the king , fresh acclamations were heard ; these announced the arrival of the queen .: 55.65
<S> shall we go together ? you annoyed , count ? said beauchamp ; and by what ? ah , you think very lightly of it ; i should like to see you with a brief preparing in your house . what brief ? the one m. de villefort is preparing against my amiable assassin some brigand escaped from the gallows apparently . true , said beauchamp ; i saw it in the paper .: 117.23
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> adieu , paris , adieu ! his look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night ; he passed his hand over his brow , got into the carriage , the door was closed on him , and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise .: 53.71
<S> monte cristo , in taking the seat morcerf offered him , placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains , and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each <UNK> time had planted there .: 122.62
<S> about seven in the morning andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight , which played , warm and brilliant , upon his face .: 57.00
<S> the first row , seeing their sergeant stop , stopped in their turn , and so on to the very last .: 124.93
<S> he was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting suspicion .: 126.06
<S> which is to recover a lost and adored son . a lost and adored son ! stolen away in his infancy , either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies . at the age of five years ! said the major with a deep sigh , and raising his eye to heaven .: 90.37
<S> these rochellais are bungling fellows , said athos ; how many have we killed of them a dozen ? or fifteen . how many did we crush under the wall ? eight or ten . and in exchange for all that not even a scratch !: 127.94
<S> franz could not , we will not say see him , but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfred s shoulders , or beneath lara s <UNK> .: 246.95
<S> i do not reject it altogether , said athos ; but i wish to remind aramis that he can not quit the camp , and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy ; that two hours after the messenger has set out , all the <UNK> , all the police , all the black caps of the cardinal , will know your letter by heart , and you and your clever person will be arrested . without reckoning , objected porthos , that the queen would save monsieur de buckingham , but would take no heed of us . gentlemen , said d artagnan , what porthos says is full of sense . ah , ah !: 73.43
<S> without you ?: 97.54
<S> what o clock is it ? the baron drew out his watch .: 35.84
<S> was the gascon determined to keep it as a weapon against milady , or else , let us be frank , did he not reserve the sapphire as a last resource for his outfit ?: 110.04
<S> the road to picardy .: 20.24
<S> but all three reflected upon the youth of d artagnan , and dreaded his <UNK> .: 105.01
<S> on the <UNK> the <UNK> army had attempted a sortie , more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious intention .: 409.05
<S> but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible , and there are certain invitations contained in even the <UNK> food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach .: 630.35
<S> we shall not be safe till we have seen mazarin , and then the devil ! said porthos ; what can we say to mazarin ? leave that to me i have my plan .: 47.87
<S> why did he detain her ?: 35.31
<S> do you talk of your honor ?: 23.26
<S> well , resumed athos , swear on this cross , which , in spite of its magnificent material , is still a cross ; swear to be united in spite of everything , and forever , and may this oath bind us to each other , and even , also , our descendants !: 95.13
<S> you are laughing at him , caderousse . no , he replied , only hark how he sighs !: 149.20
<S> the queen , my sister , is no longer queen , my child .: 21.89
<S> more than fifty private carriages followed the twenty mourning coaches , and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on foot .: 196.87
<S> still i was but an agent , led on by an invisible and offended deity , who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that i was destined to hurl .: 219.47
<S> dante s listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness ; but , leaping lightly ashore , he signified his desire to be quite alone .: 133.51
<S> she then made an extraordinary effort to receive him , but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile .: 88.48
<S> you are joking !: 26.50
<S> grimaud ! he cried ; remain ; i wish it . then , replied grimaud , you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed . he saluted and made a movement to depart .: 40.56
<S> be tranquil , murmured milady ; i will avenge you and cruelly ! peste ! said d artagnan to himself , the moment for <UNK> has not yet come . it took some time for d artagnan to resume this little dialogue ; but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely vanished .: 71.35
<S> can i be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for ? the voice became more and more indistinct ; a tumultuous movement shook the partition .: 97.32
<S> now , said d artagnan , for the actual man .: 31.19
<S> and does the husband of this frightful creature still live ? said aramis .: 70.11
<S> tis easily guessed .: 208.28
<S> la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time , then shrugging her shoulders , she took her seat immediately opposite to him .: 47.65
<S> it was also considered a luxury to have them alive , it being an amusing sight to see them die , for , when dying , they change color three or four times , and like the <UNK> when it disappears , pass through all the <UNK> shades , after which they were sent to the kitchen .: 154.96
<S> d e pinay can not leave the drawing room at present . it is at this moment , replied barrois with the same firmness , that m. noirtier , my master , wishes to speak on important subjects to m. franz d e pinay . grandpapa noirtier can speak now , then , said edward , with his habitual quickness .: 49.08
<S> the englishmen , convinced of these peaceful proceedings , sheathed their swords grumblingly .: 277.89
<S> we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other .: 53.01
<S> in the meanwhile the hours passed , if not rapidly , at least tolerably .: 117.54
<S> and here are the other five hundred , replied milady , placing her hand upon the bag of gold .: 30.21
<S> ma foi , yes ; though he was in his own element . what do you mean ? the report was that he had been a naval officer , who had been confined for plotting with the bonapartists . great is truth , muttered the count , fire can not burn , nor water drown it !: 95.26
<S> the nostrils of the horse were no longer above water , and the rider , who had lost the reins in struggling , fell with his head back and his arms extended .: 59.98
<S> i am myself a frenchman .: 41.89
<S> are you not a christian ? he said , falling on his knees .: 12.33
<S> it was the signal of a visit .: 21.92
<S> no , i would join the escort . athos s eyes shone with joy .: 29.65
<S> villefort , from his study , heard the successive noises which accompany the life of a house , the opening and shutting of doors , the ringing of madame de villefort s bell , to summon the waiting maid , mingled with the first shouts of the child , who rose full of the enjoyment of his age .: 100.79
<S> true , interrupted the young man , i had not looked upon it in that light . now , replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your father s mind , which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him , how you have been treated by your persecutors , and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank .: 53.30
<S> a large stone had served as a wedge ; flints and pebbles had been inserted around it , so as to conceal the orifice ; this species of <UNK> had been covered with earth , and grass and weeds had grown there , moss had clung to the stones , myrtle bushes had taken root , and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth .: 250.82
<S> charles perceived it and took his hand .: 65.17
<S> terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from paris till she reached burgundy , her native place .: 194.56
<S> sir , said planchet , in a mournful tone , do you abandon me thus to my fate ?: 21.42
<S> that s ingenious , said athos .: 25.70
<S> they knew all they wished to know ; the bastion was guarded .: 46.47
<S> poor brute accustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable , the arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in arabia . that s why you want to purchase my english horse , said debray , you think he will bear the cold better . you are mistaken , for i have made a vow never to return to africa . you were very much frightened , then ? asked beauchamp .: 118.85
<S> since the death of little edward a great change had taken place in monte cristo .: 89.18
<S> my death , then , will not be to her as the death of a stranger ! laporte burst into tears .: 52.81
<S> an affair for the police !: 89.98
<S> but all at once , as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought , the countenance of the cardinal , till then gloomy , cleared up by degrees , and recovered perfect serenity .: 145.81
<S> again the abbe had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to <UNK> him .: 161.64
<S> a gallant knight can not decline a rendezvous with a lady ; but a prudent gentleman may excuse himself from not waiting on his eminence , particularly when he has reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments . i am of aramis s opinion , said porthos .: 76.70
<S> oh , good lord ! said kitty , in a low voice , what is the matter with you ?: 10.22
<S> all that he was allowed to say , in case of emergencies , was the proverbial <UNK> <UNK> !: 216.93
<S> i told you so , said d artagnan , checking him with his hand ; and now his eminence confirms it . and you , monsieur d artagnan , what do you want ? my lord , said d artagnan , it is twenty years since cardinal de richelieu made me lieutenant . yes , and you would be gratified if cardinal mazarin should make you captain . d artagnan bowed .: 36.59
<S> but you are dripping , my dear fellow ; you must change your clothes , as <UNK> said to <UNK> .: 112.60
<S> at the <UNK> off of the road toward paris , aramis , who had followed in the cardinal s suite , turned back .: 70.19
<S> what is the matter , monsieur ? said planchet .: 7.32
<S> this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance , perhaps on account of the darkness of the night , which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned .: 105.02
<S> a burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred cannon ; the air burned , <UNK> by flaming <UNK> , then the frightful lightning disappeared , the <UNK> sank , one after another , into the abyss , where they were extinguished , and save for a slight vibration in the air , after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that nothing had happened .: 123.25
<S> we must let monsieur de beaufort come . in fact , the evening after this conversation the report was circulated that the prince de conde had arrived .: 46.89
<S> adieu , madame .: 18.48
<S> ah , he exclaimed , it is no longer brucine that is used ; let me see what it is ! then he ran to one of the cupboards in valentine s room , which had been transformed into a medicine closet , and taking from its silver case a small bottle of <UNK> <UNK> , dropped a little of it into the liquor , which immediately changed to a blood red color .: 80.77
<S> your horses got as far as <UNK> , when they darted forward like mad things , and galloped away at so fearful a rate , that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that <UNK> their progress , when a strange looking man , an arab , a negro , or a nubian , at least a black of some nation or other at a signal from the count , whose domestic he is , suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals , even at the risk of being trampled to death himself ; and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape .: 220.34
<S> have i not told you so , gentlemen ?: 19.37
<S> you owe me an explanation , and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor . it is from no personal ill feeling towards the viscount , that is all i can say , sir , replied danglars , who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down .: 68.26
<S> this treasure will be lost .: 27.29
<S> ah ! said mordaunt , with a sneer , there s one who is afraid . zounds ! exclaimed d artagnan , bounding toward him , who says that athos is afraid ? let him have his say , d artagnan , said athos , with a smile of sadness and contempt .: 34.04
<S> that same night the general was to go over to the english .: 54.72
<S> she heard the count s sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity ; then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors , and left with that dignified step which virgil <UNK> to his <UNK> . chapter 87 .: 195.58
<S> were her fears realized ?: 749.91
<S> i looked upon myself as another judith ; i gathered myself up , my knife in my hand , and when i saw him near me , stretching out his arms to find his victim , then , with the last cry of agony and despair , i struck him in the middle of his breast .: 46.17
<S> gentlemen , i am young , scarcely twenty three years old .: 34.53
<S> faria smiled <UNK> on him , and the young man retired to his task , in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend .: 99.37
<S> beware that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i detest you .: 39.10
<S> it is a wretched bed , but that is not my fault , and it is you who have chosen it . with these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary .: 33.00
<S> the members , apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening , were all in attendance .: 83.49
<S> this one will not <UNK> you by his dignity . tis the same thing you understand me , d artagnan a court . there s no court now .: 106.38
<S> upon which the stranger asked his name , and learning that it was porthos , and not d artagnan , he assisted him to rise , brought him back to the ho tel , mounted his horse , and disappeared . so it was with monsieur d artagnan this stranger meant to quarrel ? it appears so . and do you know what has become of him ? no , i never saw him until that moment , and have not seen him since . very well ; i know all that i wish to know .: 34.50
<S> thus he never failed to pay his <UNK> court to her ; and the self satisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to respond .: 150.54
<S> saved ? repeated morrel , not being able to conceive such intense happiness ; by whom ? by my grandfather .: 82.59
<S> do you still wish to dispose of all ? yes . but they will contest the will after your death ? no . my father knows me , replied villefort ; he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me ; besides , he understands that in my position i can not plead against the poor . the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph .: 61.39
<S> a sailor on watch hailed the boat ; the boat replied .: 208.17
<S> is it not natural that the madman , ignorant of his folly , should attempt things beyond his power ?: 124.35
<S> the hour came for him to retire .: 28.93
<S> what ails you ? asked porthos .: 7.13
<S> confess ; you know i have the right of giving absolution . i , monseigneur ? said athos .: 46.02
<S> the prisoner heard the cry , which sounded like the sob of a broken heart , and leaning from the coach he called out , good bye , merce de s we shall soon meet again ! then the vehicle disappeared round one of the <UNK> of fort saint nicholas .: 88.05
<S> besides , i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut . i wish we were already there , said d artagnan ; and my advice is that we reach london before daybreak , even if we kill our horses . come on , then , said athos , for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go . the friends urged on their horses and arrived , in fact , at about five o clock in the morning .: 50.36
<S> the count is not ; and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourselves . tis true . where can we find another sword ? asked porthos .: 54.87
<S> now we may say at last , thank heaven !: 68.22
<S> will your excellency deign to open it ? said the delighted bertuccio , and you will find gloves in it . elsewhere the count found everything he required smelling bottles , cigars , <UNK> <UNK> .: 226.02
<S> villefort had calculated rightly .: 153.27
<S> well , there , sir , is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth , and that none but the wicked prosper .: 83.44
<S> only the felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and groslow and his three sailors were consumed .: 60.87
<S> sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her , and at others she is merely attended by a black servant . and what do you think of her personal appearance ? oh , i consider her perfectly lovely she is just my idea of what <UNK> must have been . franz and the countess exchanged a smile , and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert , while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company .: 85.84
<S> oh , how happy you must be in not having either wife or children ! do you think so ? indeed i do . and so mademoiselle danglars she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch , so she asked permission to travel . and is she gone ? the other night she left . with madame danglars ? no , with a relation .: 101.87
<S> and the disappearance of his money ; how am i to justify it if i am here ? you are right ; we must go out . go out ?: 67.64
<S> adieu ! and raising himself by a final effort , in which he summoned all his faculties , he said , monte cristo , forget not monte cristo ! and he fell back on the bed .: 60.20
<S> the same had been done for the queen and madame the president .: 37.31
<S> yet perhaps if i had found you humble and penitent , i might have prevented benedetto from killing you ; but i found you proud and blood thirsty , and i left you in the hands of god . i do not believe there is a god , howled caderousse ; you do not believe it ; you lie you lie ! silence , said the abbe ; you will force the last drop of blood from your veins .: 88.81
<S> the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession , and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing .: 131.47
<S> as to my father , you will not see him ; he is <UNK> engaged , and dines with the chief <UNK> .: 92.71
<S> baptistin looked at his master , who made a sign to him , and he went out , closing the door after him .: 12.06
<S> you know that i don t like it .: 18.78
<S> it seems to me that it is neither your majesty nor myself who can charge himself with such a mission . how did they act with regard to the <UNK> <UNK> d ancre ? cried the king , in the highest state of <UNK> ; first her closets were thoroughly searched , and then she herself . the <UNK> <UNK> d ancre was no more than the <UNK> <UNK> d ancre .: 200.10
<S> have you decided ? said she .: 27.73
<S> morcerf ! repeated debray .: 44.28
<S> we also informed monsieur porthos of what was going on ; but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman s word , and that as he had said the horse was his , it must be so . that s porthos all over , murmured d artagnan .: 70.14
<S> the two men remained opposite one another , morrel trembling in every limb , the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity .: 53.91
<S> they went to find porthos , and at the corner of the rue bac met mousqueton , who , with a most pitiable air , was driving before him a mule and a horse .: 49.91
<S> the worthy merchant had been more fortunate .: 92.86
<S> the child accepted joyfully .: 250.38
<S> all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady ; so , rocked by them , she soon fell asleep .: 86.07
<S> they deputed ten of their number to wait upon the duke of orleans , who , according to his custom , affected popularity .: 93.17
<S> remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe ; and think that what you are about to do is for his sake . yes , yes , everything for him .: 33.03
<S> it is a fine name to <UNK> on my ledgers , and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the cavalcanti were .: 105.74
<S> we must go , replied villefort , offering his arm .: 23.42
<S> four servants carried in two casks covered with <UNK> plants , and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table .: 201.00
<S> excuse me , abbe , said the envoy of the prefect of the police , but the light tries my eyes very much . the abbe lowered the shade .: 76.88
<S> the king , even while obeying him like a child , hated him as a child hates his master , and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of monsieur and the queen .: 76.42
<S> your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in <UNK> his cargo , and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required , whether touching the health of his crew , or the value of his freight . what is the meaning of all this ? inquired caderousse , <UNK> , of danglars , who had assumed an air of utter surprise .: 103.22
<S> the man , who had the appearance of being a butcher , descended a little <UNK> and isolated street , looking on to the river , with two of his friends .: 76.28
<S> yes . shall i call him ? yes . valentine went to the door , and called barrois .: 20.01
<S> then i thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers , and that then she would suppose i was your accomplice ; so i took what little money i had and the best of my things , and i got away .: 89.65
<S> keep your ill humor at home in your money boxes , or , since you have clerks whom you pay , vent it upon them . not so , replied danglars ; your advice is wrong , so i shall not follow it .: 121.60
<S> he returned <UNK> , advised the prisoner to be more careful , and departed .: 115.60
<S> at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the half open door , and told his master that the horses were ready .: 54.16
<S> come , said d artagnan , let us go . and they set out for boulogne , where toward evening they arrived , their horses flecked with foam and dark with perspiration .: 44.68
<S> it was cowardly , i confess , but it was not criminal . <UNK> i understand you allowed matters to take their course , that was all . yes , sir , answered caderousse ; and remorse preys on me night and day .: 103.84
<S> bah ! said porthos , why separate , since we are all together ? because you can and ought to return to france ; your mission is accomplished , but ours is not . your mission is not accomplished ? exclaimed d artagnan , looking in astonishment at athos .: 78.12
<S> tis enough to kill the body , without killing the soul . bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether <UNK> the tone in which it was uttered .: 260.24
<S> listen to me , said the countess , and do not be so very headstrong .: 25.68
<S> michon , seamstress , tours . the three friends looked at one another and laughed ; they were caught .: 100.85
<S> this fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly .: 129.61
<S> that little stratagem may serve to keep off <UNK> . very well , monsieur ; i will obey you at all points . athos made two visits in paris ; at seven o clock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles ; it was stopped by porters , horses and footmen .: 82.34
<S> copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change .: 43.19
<S> madame de villefort at this really did turn pale , and was very nearly angry with this household plague , who answered to the name of edward ; but the count , on the contrary , smiled , and appeared to look at the boy complacently , which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm .: 113.10
<S> all along the road , what athos had said respecting mme .: 80.88
<S> now i think we are rich , since instead of the 114 francs we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of <UNK> but we owe something in this house ? thirty francs ; but i pay that out of my <UNK> francs , that is understood , and as i require only eighty francs for my journey , you see i am overwhelmed with luxury .: 122.53
<S> ah , replied he , guessing franz s thought , i know this is a serious matter . what should you do in my place ? i , who have nothing to lose , i should go . <UNK> you would accept ? yes , were it only out of curiosity . there is something very peculiar about this chief , then ? listen , said gaetano , lowering his voice , i do not know if what they say is true he stopped to see if anyone was near .: 60.53
<S> monsieur is , as usual , led by his favorite ; yesterday it was <UNK> , to day it is la riviere , to morrow it will be some one else .: 123.54
<S> there were four or five more in the emerald , which would contain about a dozen .: 63.80
<S> old dante s , who was only sustained by hope , lost all hope at napoleon s downfall .: 106.95
<S> oh , if he knows the contents of this ! murmured he , and that noirtier is the father of villefort , i am lost ! and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts .: 32.19
<S> the former dante s proposed to augment , the latter to remedy .: 134.52
<S> i shall try also to help him to down the fronde , but on one condition that he sometimes remembers the king s faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that i could name .: 190.45
<S> my sword is shorter than yours , it s true , but , bah !: 67.78
<S> now , sir , said albert , if you think my apology sufficient , pray give me your hand .: 44.50
<S> it was winter s .: 58.09
<S> now my work is accomplished , my mission is terminated , now thou canst neither afford me pain nor pleasure .: 276.82
<S> in that case i will forgive him . and the musketeer rose , grumbling , took his sword , hat , pistols , and cloak , and followed the officer , whilst porthos , alone and sole possessor of the bed , endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep , which his predecessor had set him .: 67.26
<S> then , in the evening , i shall go to the theatre ; i shall look like some retired baker .: 41.73
<S> i shall meet them there , and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview ?: 149.11
<S> the arrest produced no sensation , indeed was almost unknown , and scarcely interrupted the course of events .: 142.72
<S> i could extend my occupation as a fisherman , might get a place as clerk in a warehouse , and become in time a dealer myself . you could do no such thing , fernand ; you are a soldier , and if you remain at the catalans it is because there is no war ; so remain a fisherman , and contented with my friendship , as i can not give you more . well , i will do better , merce de s .: 83.74
<S> to eat do you hear ? are you hungry ? come , you understand me . what would your excellency like to eat ? a piece of dry bread , since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed place . bread ?: 114.77
<S> yes , yes , said lord de winter , who perceived what was passing in her mind ; yes , you look for the signature , and you say to yourself : all is not lost , for that order is not signed .: 34.13
<S> is it from mere humanity you bid me live ?: 456.49
<S> when she recognized her lover , the poor girl extended her arms to him , and believed herself safe ; but carlini felt his heart sink , for he but too well knew the fate that awaited her .: 66.73
<S> oh , d artagnan , my beloved d artagnan !: 12.48
<S> the appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation .: 125.62
<S> who knows ?: 45.37
<S> perhaps you will think , sir , that prosperity has spoiled me ? art thou happy , friend ? asked d artagnan .: 59.44
<S> there was a great press of people in m. de villefort s antechamber , but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name .: 46.53
<S> now , albert , said he , you understand me do you not ?: 12.60
<S> i have particular business to settle with this gentleman and i shall and will begin . porthos and aramis drew back , disappointed , and drawing his sword d artagnan turned to his adversary : sir , i am waiting for you . and for my part , gentlemen , i admire you .: 41.98
<S> madame , said he , with dignity , there will shortly be a ball at the ho tel de ville .: 31.82
<S> monsieur cardinal is indeed a privileged man ! imagine my astonishment , continued milady , when i found myself face to face with this woman ! does she know you ? no . then she looks upon you as a stranger ? milady smiled .: 107.01
<S> god help me ! chapter 107 .: 76.85
<S> how so ? returned the count , with surprise .: 17.04
<S> planchet !: 40.18
<S> he had only found the first grotto ; he had now to seek the second .: 41.69
<S> i tried to speak .: 15.45
<S> sometimes in the midst of dinner , when everyone , under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation , believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table , aramis looked at his watch , arose with a <UNK> smile , and took leave of the company , to go , as he said , to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment .: 68.19
<S> he was in a most elegant hunting costume ; and monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him .: 70.87
<S> here , he said , i am very straightforward in my <UNK> take your choice . the woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis , and the husband a pair of buckles , worth perhaps fifteen francs .: 167.38
<S> i shall go and die by his side . madame , madame , exclaimed de winter , your majesty abandons yourself to despair ; and yet , perhaps , there still remains some hope . no friends left , my lord ; no other friends left in the wide world but yourself !: 75.04
<S> and will you not torment me any more ? never . caderousse had become so gloomy that andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change .: 80.53
<S> the door of the guardhouse opens , as you see . yes , i see . they are about to send into our court , which monsieur de mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery , the two guards who attend him . there they are , coming out . if only they close the guardhouse door !: 79.54
<S> and why ? ah , very well ! said d artagnan ; i see that you understand french .: 18.51
<S> and when can i see this young lady , for whom i already feel so great a sympathy ? asked milady .: 55.36
<S> <UNK> of every selfish wish , his heart <UNK> with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor , which recalled to him a good and brave man .: 285.62
<S> the carriage is at the door ; you bid me adieu ; you mount the step to embrace me a last time ; my brother s servant , who comes to fetch me , is told how to proceed ; he makes a sign to the postillion , and we set off at a gallop . but d artagnan !: 55.46
<S> to hold for five minutes the gates , they will be torn down , twisted into iron wire , ground to powder !: 208.05
<S> a few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences , and he seemed much occupied with chemistry .: 95.77
<S> are you there ? asked porthos .: 9.08
<S> lord wilmore resided in rue fontaine saint georges .: 426.55
<S> yet this catalan has eyes that <UNK> like those of the <UNK> spaniards , <UNK> , and <UNK> , and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow .: 579.11
<S> he made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the mistress had gone for a walk .: 91.34
<S> the blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner .: 43.31
<S> d artagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue master friquet , but not wishing to leave raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it .: 94.28
<S> she would invoke the past , recall old recollections ; she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty , yet happy days .: 292.16
<S> i have had the honor of informing your eminence that these men were drunk . and was this lady young and handsome ? asked the cardinal , with a certain degree of anxiety .: 38.02
<S> of monsieur de bouillon . my friend , i think that he is much troubled with gout . you noticed that i didn t breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit ? you did well ; you would have caused him an access of his disease .: 78.07
<S> porthos left the service , and in the course of the following year married mme .: 79.03
<S> oh ! said porthos , there is quite a gap between that fate and the <UNK> coronet you promised me , d artagnan . bah !: 102.72
<S> come , come , choose your part , replied jussac .: 36.40
<S> ah , ha ! said he , i hope all is over , explained and settled . yes , said beauchamp ; the absurd reports have died away , and should they be renewed , i would be the first to oppose them ; so let us speak no more of it . albert will tell you , replied the count that i gave him the same advice .: 58.13
<S> and what do you know about the state you talk of ? said mme .: 25.61
<S> never mind , continued the man in the cloak ; you were a fool not to have pretended to accept the mission .: 43.62
<S> yes , if you really wish it , said d artagnan , and even with great pleasure , i confess ; the journey has given me a devil of an appetite . ah , my poor friend ! said aramis , you will find meagre fare ; you were not expected . am i then threatened with the omelet of crevecoeur ? oh , let us hope , said aramis , that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find something better than that in the <UNK> of the worthy jesuit fathers .: 60.54
<S> so that now , thanks be to god , we do not want , as monsieur can <UNK> , for partridges , rabbits , carp or eels all light , wholesome food , suitable for the sick . but the wine , said d artagnan , who furnishes the wine ?: 208.06
<S> what vessel is that ? asked milady .: 30.25
<S> he extended his hand .: 10.05
<S> my dear franz , m. maximilian morrel , an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence , and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection , wit , or amiability . morrel hesitated for a moment ; he feared it would be hypocritical to <UNK> in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing , but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory ; he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz .: 103.48
<S> are you a man of imagination a poet ?: 35.59
<S> nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves , but purely and simply fugitives , driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village , and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or <UNK> ; for my own part , i protest that , should i ever go to corsica , my first visit , ere even i presented myself to the mayor or prefect , should be to the bandits of <UNK> , if i could only manage to find them ; for , on my conscience , they are a race of men i admire greatly . still , persisted franz , i suppose you will allow that such men as vampa and his band are regular villains , who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person .: 182.04
<S> the cries which the police officer repeated twenty times : in the king s name , were powerless against this formidable multitude seemed , on the contrary , to exasperate it still more ; when , at the shout , in the name of the king , an officer ran up , and seeing the uniforms ill treated , he sprang into the <UNK> sword in hand , and brought unexpected help to the guards .: 161.17
<S> valentine , as her only apology for not having met him , pointed to the corpse under the sheet , and began to sob again .: 102.49
<S> after being the instrument of human justice i <UNK> to be that of the justice of god . but let me see , how was it done ?: 79.02
<S> merce de s turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven .: 30.69
<S> by this means the end of the month was passed , but his resources were now exhausted .: 40.44
<S> suddenly the daylight began to fade away ; franz took out his watch it was half past four .: 87.99
<S> you can come , he said , and led them back to noirtier .: 31.66
<S> not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me , but simply that if , through your assistance , i could distribute the <UNK> according to the wishes of the testator , why , so much the better , that is all . i hope it may be so , replied caderousse , his face flushed with cupidity .: 53.40
<S> they looked hesitatingly around them , and appeared to doubt the <UNK> of the partition between them and the office of m. de tre ville ; but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence , and then the laughter recovered its <UNK> and the light was not withheld from any of his actions .: 102.29
<S> the count opened the letter , and read : m .: 12.64
<S> we have no time now for suspicions , said athos .: 34.56
<S> d artagnan and porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet .: 20.34
<S> bonacieux came in ; and to remove all suspicion , if she had any , milady repeated to the lackey , before her , the latter part of her instructions .: 90.42
<S> from time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from the <UNK> , and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor mercer .: 87.62
<S> after this , satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at meung , without remorse for the past , confident in the present , and full of hope for the future , he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the brave .: 69.52
<S> he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened ; and as , during three years that he had travelled all over italy , a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share , franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion .: 87.49
<S> were you a party man ?: 74.97
<S> really ?: 53.58
<S> madame danglars turned very pale , then exclaimed : i can not believe it ; the thing is impossible . i assure you , madame , replied the woman , it is as i have said . turning impatiently towards her husband , madame danglars demanded , is this true ? is what true , madame ? inquired danglars , visibly agitated .: 36.32
<S> franz was about to ring for signor pastrini , when that worthy presented himself .: 98.37
<S> my lord escape !: 103.71
<S> i am perhaps come too soon , count , said he , but i frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my eyes all night , nor has anyone in my house .: 65.54
<S> julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room , descended to the next floor , ran into the drawing room with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the alle es de meilhan .: 55.17
<S> i had chosen this <UNK> tell me , dear d artagnan , if it is not to your taste non inutile est desiderium in oblatione ; that is , a little regret is not <UNK> in an offering to the lord . stop there ! cried the jesuit , for that thesis touches closely upon <UNK> .: 247.78
<S> as i said , monsieur , lubin did not know me , and told me our adventure from one end to the other . well done , planchet !: 60.21
<S> planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his shadow , and was soon <UNK> by his side .: 42.45
<S> for i have no friend but yourself upon earth , who am neglected and forgotten by my father , harassed and persecuted by my stepmother , and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man , whose withered hand can no longer press mine , and who can speak to me with the eye alone , although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild .: 176.18
<S> the salon was filled with the works of modern artists ; there were landscapes by <UNK> , with their long <UNK> and tall trees , their <UNK> oxen and marvellous skies ; delacroix s arabian cavaliers , with their long white <UNK> , their shining <UNK> , their damasked arms , their horses , who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended <UNK> with their maces ; <UNK> of <UNK> , representing notre dame de paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet ; there were paintings by <UNK> , who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers , his <UNK> more brilliant than the sun ; designs by decamp , as vividly colored as those of <UNK> rosa , but more poetic ; <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> , representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin ; <UNK> torn from the album of <UNK> travels in the east , that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a <UNK> , or beneath the dome of a <UNK> in a word , all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past .: 537.53
<S> still more , the light which had shone for an instant disappeared , and all was again in obscurity .: 81.48
<S> take care , my young friend .: 14.32
<S> the baroness approached , leaning on madame de villefort s arm .: 22.68
<S> athos has been arrested . yesterday , at saint germain , as he came out from the presence of the queen . the arms of d artagnan fell powerless by his side .: 48.15
<S> never , planchet !: 41.28
<S> then , my lord then what ? asked mazarin .: 43.93
<S> d artagnan related to athos all that had passed at the church between porthos and the procurator s wife , and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be equipped .: 48.36
<S> luigi was not mistaken .: 27.98
<S> that will be for another time . he owed me for the councillor , the <UNK> ! but , said porthos , if he was not crushed completely ah !: 96.14
<S> then , when de winter rose to take leave : listen , my lord , said the queen ; i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother , and this order of st. michael which came from my husband .: 49.01
<S> i understand that mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs ; that his orders are not respected like those of our former <UNK> , the deceased cardinal , whose portrait as you see hangs yonder for whatever may be thought of him , it must be allowed that richelieu was great . i will not contradict you there , said d artagnan .: 109.57
<S> in truth , that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer , was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed , as we have observed , more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors deserted by courtiers , and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter ridicule , which , arising from the streets below , penetrated through the very <UNK> of the room , which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister ; as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing let off , happily , without other end or aim , except to show to the guards , the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal , that the people were possessed of arms .: 245.46
<S> once past the frontier , andrea proposed making money of his diamonds ; and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank notes he always carried about with him in case of accident , he would then find himself possessor of about 50,000 livres , which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all .: 291.89
<S> m. debray has made me lose 700,000 francs ; let him bear his share of the loss , and we will go on as before ; if not , let him become bankrupt for the 250,000 livres , and do as all bankrupts do disappear .: 130.32
<S> d artagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent .: 99.92
<S> i have confidence in the remedy i propose , and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its efficacy . count , you prolong my agony . then , said the count , your feeble spirit will not even grant me the trial i request ?: 93.89
<S> he insisted upon it , declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished .: 100.15
<S> deuce take those italian princes ! a man , too , who could boast of dante for a <UNK> , and could reckon back to the <UNK> <UNK> . a nobility of the rope ! said cha teau renaud phlegmatically .: 299.16
<S> wooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones stick out !: 1173.03
<S> if i bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of england . what is your name , then ? asked mazarin .: 26.25
<S> i say there , for as i did not consider my house safe enough , or lawyers sufficiently discreet , and as landed property carries evidence with it , and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband , i have kept this sum , now your whole fortune , in a chest concealed under that closet , and for greater security i myself concealed it there .: 186.90
<S> what will come out of those three elements when i am no longer present to <UNK> them ?: 124.89
<S> going along , d artagnan , shaking his head , said : i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd ; but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend , a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters . oh , monsieur athos was a noble gentleman , said planchet , was he not ?: 72.94
<S> have you , then , so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know ? our coachman is a member of the club , said the president ; we shall be driven by a state councillor . then we run another risk , said the general , laughing , that of being upset . we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting , but that he came willingly .: 82.57
<S> my dear fellow , be a musketeer or an abbe .: 24.84
<S> those costumes , he said , are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queen s courtiers ; they are costumes of battle . d artagnan and porthos obeyed .: 105.34
<S> a friend ! responded peppino ; and , advancing alone towards the sentry , he said a few words to him in a low tone ; and then he , like the first , saluted the nocturnal visitors , making a sign that they might proceed .: 47.64
<S> a daughter of henry iv. , of that great , that sublime sovereign all which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his son in law , sir !: 87.58
<S> i said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner , a friend of the duc de beaufort , who called for help .: 24.59
<S> it resulted from this that the real stake in this game , which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men , was simply a kind look from anne of austria .: 179.93
<S> what is the use of boring one s self with so many things ?: 56.17
<S> alas , said edmond , smiling , these are the treasures the cardinal has left ; and the good abbe , seeing in a dream these glittering walls , has indulged in <UNK> hopes . but he called to mind the words of the will , which he knew by heart .: 134.45
<S> each retired to his own apartment .: 87.25
<S> this fortress was his post as king s attorney , all the advantages of which he <UNK> with marvellous skill , and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy , and thus to replace neutrality by opposition .: 154.56
<S> my friend , said andrea , i was coming from <UNK> to senlis , when my horse , which is a troublesome creature , stumbled and threw me .: 72.27
<S> now , gascons are always poor , are they not ? sire , i can assert that they have hitherto discovered no gold mines in their mountains ; though the lord owes them this miracle in recompense for the manner in which they supported the pretensions of the king your father . which is to say that the gascons made a king of me , myself , seeing that i am my father s son , is it not , tre ville ?: 99.23
<S> now saddle the other three horses . do you think , then , monsieur , that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece ? said planchet , with his shrewd air .: 70.30
<S> is there a house in the neighborhood ? asked d artagnan .: 12.96
<S> have you seen him lately ? he sent for me to day . really !: 38.81
<S> he was rather above the middle height , with thin reddish whiskers , light complexion and light hair , turning rather gray .: 209.72
<S> hold your tongue , you stupid fellow ! said the young man ; i am d artagnan ; don t you know me ?: 22.10
<S> so no more delay , no more hesitation ; or else whatever may be my repugnance to <UNK> my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you , i swear by my faith as an honest man and at these words d artagnan made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up .: 106.69
<S> i approached him , and said in a low voice , well , since you know the corsicans so well , you know that they always keep their word .: 41.40
<S> gracious heaven , exclaimed he .: 56.83
<S> but , extraordinary to relate , the father did not say , thank you , my child , nor did the daughter smile at her father .: 64.65
<S> now , they will be far from looking for us among the puritans ; therefore , with the puritans we must go . good , my friend , good ! said athos .: 43.75
<S> she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed .: 34.06
<S> danglars is his banker , is he not ? asked cha teau renaud of debray .: 38.82
<S> two other men descended after danglars forming the <UNK> , and pushing danglars whenever he happened to stop , they came by a gentle declivity to the <UNK> of two corridors .: 324.88
<S> yes , i have seen him , he replied , and he has handed this letter to me .: 17.69
<S> no , kitty , you are mistaken .: 21.90
<S> this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy , when they could but lament the absence of dante s , whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so <UNK> .: 146.53
<S> oh , you do not understand me !: 9.66
<S> well , said aramis , when they were alone , what do you think of this business , my dear count ? bad , replied athos , very bad . but you received it with enthusiasm . as i shall ever receive the defense of a great principle , my dear d herblay .: 37.04
<S> do not seek your wife , read d artagnan ; she will be restored to you when there is no longer occasion for her .: 38.11
<S> ah , true , replied the jeweller , and he <UNK> the stone .: 44.42
<S> the usurper s conversion ! murmured the duke , looking at the king and dandre , who spoke alternately , like virgil s shepherds .: 133.58
<S> providence is now opposed to them , when i most thought it would be <UNK> .: 134.21
<S> albert remarked this , expressing his fears lest , at the <UNK> , the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point .: 246.57
<S> no , you shall live honored and pure ; you shall live to triumph over your enemies . milady put him from her slowly with her hand , while drawing him nearer with her look ; but felton , in his turn , embraced her more closely , imploring her like a <UNK> .: 92.53
<S> my death , believe me , will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure . where was the monk going ? asked grimaud .: 58.92
<S> beside him glided caderousse , whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dante s , father and son , although there still lingered in his mind a faint and <UNK> recollection of the events of the preceding night ; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream .: 223.79
<S> carriages now arrived in <UNK> ; those of the marechal de villeroy , guitant , villequier and comminges came into the line .: 249.39
<S> the reader may ask , how came planchet here ? when he was left stiff as a rush in london .: 208.14
<S> neither you nor myself , but fernand ; you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the room indeed , i fancied i had destroyed it . oh , no , replied caderousse , that i can answer for , you did not .: 42.69
<S> come , guitant , come along , and let s see if they keep watch at the quinze <UNK> as at the barriere des sergens . and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined d artagnan , who instantly put himself at the head of his troop , followed by the cardinal , guitant and the rest of the escort .: 83.97
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> friend , he said , you have been too good in pardoning me ; i was wrong , a hundred times wrong .: 39.65
<S> i have the honor to be , with respect , etc. , marechal de grammont . at the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to the count , raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young princess , and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite gratitude to the young man ; he no longer doubted that the daughter of king charles i. loved his friend .: 54.65
<S> this was neither long nor difficult .: 84.07
<S> d artagnan !: 11.49
<S> i wrote to her to send me fifty louis or so , of which i stood absolutely in need on account of my accident . well ? well , she must be at her country seat , for she has not answered me . truly ? no ; so i yesterday addressed another epistle to her , still more pressing than the first .: 102.42
<S> you were ; you know how i settled the matter . did he die ? i don t know .: 44.86
<S> curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his incognito , and he was recognized .: 132.36
<S> most undoubtedly , said planchet .: 60.84
<S> then , porthos and aramis , will you remain with this man while we go around to grimaud ? grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow , and as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle .: 89.56
<S> albert and cha teau renaud exchanged a second look , more full of amazement than the first .: 38.69
<S> ali returned a sign in the negative .: 90.12
<S> at that moment d artagnan opened his eyes .: 7.16
<S> if we were to go together to luigi vampa , i am sure he would not refuse you albert s freedom . what influence can i possibly have over a bandit ? have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten ? what is that ? have you not saved peppino s life ? well , well , said the count , who told you that ? no matter ; i know it . the count knit his brows , and remained silent an instant .: 57.23
<S> while we are forgetting them , they are falling into their appointed order ; and when , again , our attention is directed to them , we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end .: 114.99
<S> but , though he held the cardinal s promises as of little worth , he affected to be completely satisfied , for he was unwilling to <UNK> porthos .: 132.43
<S> your devotion does not commit you too far , monsieur de rochefort . and then , my lord , continued rochefort , you understand that to <UNK> from the bastile in order to enter vincennes is only to change one s prison . say at once that you are on the side of monsieur de beaufort ; that will be the most sincere line of conduct , said mazarin .: 55.84
<S> but scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown , who remained standing before the musketeer , drew back with signs of terror , and refused .: 65.60
<S> the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left ; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel , who , turning to the boat , said , s <UNK> . the italian s <UNK> is <UNK> ; it means at once , come , enter , you are welcome ; make yourself at home ; you are the master . it is like that turkish phrase of molie re s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance .: 116.55
<S> everyone drew back , and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the room .: 28.70
<S> oh , look at me , continued she , with a feeling of profound melancholy , my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy , for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dante s , who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret , then inhabited by his old father .: 92.19
<S> but although the jeweler had been mentioned first , it was the secretary who first made his appearance .: 87.52
<S> he leaped towards a dressing room near his bedroom , and in less than a moment , tearing off his cravat , his coat and waistcoat , he put on a sailor s jacket and hat , from beneath which rolled his long black hair .: 73.94
<S> he thought that voice more feeble than usual .: 54.36
<S> sir , he said , after a pause , a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither ; but as , during the greater portion of the year , this island is deserted , if the secret of this abode were discovered , i should doubtless , find on my return my temporary <UNK> in a state of great disorder , which would be exceedingly annoying , not for the loss it occasioned me , but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure .: 118.99
<S> go ; i must be alone . morrel , subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy monte cristo exercised over everything around him , did not endeavor to resist it .: 102.05
<S> listen , it is impossible .: 21.99
<S> valentine arose , placed a chair for morrel , requested barrois not to admit anyone , and having tenderly embraced her grandfather , and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel , she went away .: 127.30
<S> he was seeking in his mind , then , for the least awkward means of retreat , when he remarked that aramis had let his handkerchief fall , and by mistake , no doubt , had placed his foot upon it .: 63.22
<S> i have already recorded sentence of death , five or six times , against the <UNK> of political conspiracies , and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened , and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart ? gracious heavens , m. de villefort , said rene e , becoming more and more terrified ; you surely are not in earnest . indeed i am , replied the young magistrate with a smile ; and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness , the case would only be still more <UNK> .: 101.78
<S> on his left was porthos , whilst d artagnan was on his right ; each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side .: 88.38
<S> d artagnan and the englishman d artagnan followed milady without being perceived by her .: 44.24
<S> i say , sir , you sir , who are hiding yourself behind that shutter yes , you , sir , tell me what you are laughing at , and we will laugh together ! the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier , as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed ; then , when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter , his eyebrows slightly bent , and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described , he replied to d artagnan , i was not speaking to you , sir . but i am speaking to you ! replied the young man , additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners , of politeness and scorn .: 75.49
<S> it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes , and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled ; and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect .: 106.25
<S> could we send anyone to paris without its being known in the camp ?: 86.25
<S> a knot of rose colored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground .: 53.84
<S> allow me , then , to avoid dishonor by death ; let me take refuge in martyrdom .: 82.54
<S> mazarin pretended to laugh .: 39.30
<S> hayde e it will be recollected that the new , or rather old , acquaintances of the count of monte cristo , residing in the rue meslay , were no other than maximilian , julie , and emmanuel .: 68.68
<S> now , excuse the indiscretion , marquis , but have you any landed property ? all my fortune is in the funds ; seven or eight hundred thousand francs . then sell out sell out , marquis , or you will lose it all . <UNK> but how can i sell out here ? you have a <UNK> , have you not ? yes . then give me a letter to him , and tell him to sell out without an instant s delay , perhaps even now i shall arrive too late . the deuce you say ! replied the marquis , let us lose no time , then ! and , sitting down , he wrote a letter to his <UNK> , ordering him to sell out at the market price .: 82.67
<S> but i swear to you , sir , i swear to you , by everything a man holds dear , i have , since then , deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate . there was a brief silence , during which the fixed , searching eye of the abbe was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper .: 111.11
<S> this humble picture would have but little interest for you , accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious ; but such as we are , we have experienced bitter sorrows . and god has poured balm into your wounds , as he does into those of all who are in affliction ? said monte cristo inquiringly .: 142.19
<S> no , monsieur , it is impossible ; i can go no farther . what does this mean ? demanded the irresistible voice of monte cristo .: 21.46
<S> as we had no doctor on board , and he was so anxious to arrive at elba , that he would not touch at any other port , his disorder rose to such a height , that at the end of the third day , feeling he was dying , he called me to him .: 62.79
<S> what you ask is impossible ; but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about , and some day you will meet the governor , and if he chooses to reply , that is his affair . but , asked dante s , how long shall i have to wait ? ah , a month six months a year . it is too long a time .: 52.00
<S> what can it mean ? said debray to franz .: 19.50
<S> raoul , without dismounting , called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful .: 76.17
<S> monsieur le lieutenant , you have been very prompt .: 61.96
<S> the town is in open revolt , and just now , as i was crossing the rue montorgueil with monsieur du vallon , who is here , and is your humble servant , they wanted in spite of my uniform , or perhaps because of my uniform , to make us cry long live broussel ! and must i tell you , my lord what they wished us to cry as well ? speak , speak . down with mazarin ! i faith , the <UNK> word is out . mazarin smiled , but became very pale .: 99.44
<S> madame , he replied , monsieur d artagnan s prediction has been accomplished ; they are calm , as if by enchantment .: 43.96
<S> nevertheless , it was necessary to finish .: 23.28
<S> i will not miss you . if i give you time ! cried the duke , spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword .: 53.70
<S> does anyone dare to slander me ? monsieur , i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation . then , sir , i am patiently to submit to your refusal ? yes , sir , although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive , for i had reckoned on the honor of your alliance , and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman . enough , sir , said morcerf , we will speak no more on the subject . and clutching his gloves in anger , he left the apartment .: 80.67
<S> athos turned pale .: 20.57
<S> mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow , is she not ? said debray to franz .: 39.76
<S> the host will tell you i have three or four more , so that you will not inconvenience me in any way .: 30.42
<S> as it drew near , he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo .: 30.23
<S> ah , there !: 17.27
<S> the young men sprang up , and seized their muskets .: 22.58
<S> might he not have come for the purpose of laying a snare for him ?: 64.10
<S> this sight reassured him .: 48.96
<S> mistrust athos , therefore , who will not prosecute the affairs of any one , even his own .: 67.92
<S> they were both orphans , and had only their employers leave to ask , which had been already sought and obtained .: 140.73
<S> accustomed , however , as he was to the work , he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary , so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words , fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine s room . morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barrois s situation , and in noirtier s name gave that order .: 82.00
<S> leisurely turning round , they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them , as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence ; but as no one responded to the challenge , the friends turned again to the front of the theatre , and affected to busy themselves with the stage .: 212.13
<S> are you mad , to talk to me thus ? said buckingham .: 29.38
<S> merce de s had no fire in that cold and naked room she , who was accustomed to <UNK> which heated the house from the hall to the boudoir ; she had not even one little flower she whose apartment had been a conservatory of costly <UNK> .: 164.37
<S> you will learn <UNK> , <UNK> in all its branches , and dancing .: 270.18
<S> but my real treasure is not that , my dear friend , which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo , it is your presence , our living together five or six hours a day , in spite of our jailers ; it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain , the languages you have implanted in my memory , and which have taken root there with all their <UNK> <UNK> .: 112.53
<S> hey !: 27.97
<S> tell m. <UNK> , resumed villefort , that what he demands is impossible . then , m. <UNK> gives notice to these gentlemen , replied barrois , that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing room . astonishment was at its height .: 135.54
<S> there are men somewhere about , but that s of no consequence to us , said d artagnan ; let us ride onward . at about half past eight o clock they reached the first houses in noisy ; every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village .: 51.57
<S> have you not mentioned that name to me ? as for de winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright .: 34.46
<S> in the centre of the room was a <UNK> and <UNK> baby grand piano in rosewood , but holding the <UNK> of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity , and groaning beneath the weight of the <UNK> d uvre of <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , gre try , and <UNK> .: 456.76
<S> the lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture , such as became a man of good birth , who had in the course of his life been frequently in the society of the highest nobles .: 79.87
<S> coquenard s chamber ; they were heartrending .: 176.66
<S> forsooth !: 268.00
<S> planchet grasped him by the throat , and pressed as hard as he could .: 48.09
<S> at dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein ; half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down .: 258.28
<S> i have a letter to give you from the count . from the count ! murmured the two young people .: 27.94
<S> your mother has no longer either throne or husband ; she has neither son , money nor friends ; the whole world , my poor child , has abandoned your mother ! and she fell back , weeping , into her daughter s arms .: 89.28
<S> gentlemen , cried the coadjutor , <UNK> his <UNK> , which he wore , after the fashion of the ancient military prelates , over his archiepiscopal simar , there s the enemy approaching .: 203.80
<S> as to conditions , you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are ! come , now , what are your conditions ? rest yourself first , my lord , and we we will reflect . i do not need rest , gentlemen ; i need to know whether i am among enemies or friends . friends , my lord !: 73.60
<S> what a noise about a musketeer !: 60.81
<S> this charge was so fierce , so skillfully conducted , that chanleu was almost surrounded .: 298.96
<S> this time , in spite of my terrors , in spite of my agony , i began to feel a devouring hunger .: 57.07
<S> euge nie approached softly , and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge .: 72.84
<S> well , sir , at last said anne of austria , you are silent , after rendering such a service ? madame , replied d artagnan , i have <UNK> to say , save that my life is ever at your majesty s service , and that i shall only be happy the day i lose it for you . i know that , sir ; i have known that , said the queen , a long time ; therefore i am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem . permit me , madame , said d artagnan , to reserve a portion for my friend ; like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of tre ville ; he has done wonders . his name ? asked the queen .: 53.04
<S> you are coming to sup with me , are you not ?: 16.33
<S> when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia , a second volley of fireworks was discharged , to announce that the street was clear .: 123.16
<S> conversational .: 176.23
<S> his glance was so full of hate , of ferocity , and savage impatience , that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing , to see upon what person this dark look was directed .: 111.21
<S> i don t say , resumed the guard , that coysel is not a sorcerer , but i say that if his prophecy gets wind , it s a sure way to prevent it s coming true . how so ? why , in this way : if coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him , on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape , tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape . good lord ! said another guard , who might have been thought asleep on a bench , but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation , do you suppose that men can escape their destiny ?: 110.80
<S> la mazzolata gentlemen , said the count of monte cristo as he entered , i pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated ; but i feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments ; besides , you sent me word that you would come to me , and i have held myself at your disposal . franz and i have to thank you a thousand times , count , returned albert ; you extricated us from a great dilemma , and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us . indeed , returned the count , motioning the two young men to sit down .: 74.22
<S> oh , make yourself easy on that head , said ali , smiling ; selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter .: 140.12
<S> so it is agreed , and if porthos makes no objection i , said porthos , i will do whatever you please ; and besides , i think what the comte de la fere said just now is very good . but your future career , d artagnan your ambition , porthos ? our future , our ambition ! replied d artagnan , with feverish volubility .: 59.77
<S> richelieu , whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death , was even less popular than i am .: 173.24
<S> this was already half an hour past the time valentine had fixed .: 70.80
<S> i know well , demon , that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past , and that you have read , by the light of what torch i know not , every page of my life ; but perhaps i may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous <UNK> .: 81.37
<S> now , he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his shoulder , behind the hedges which border the roads , and when he saw a catholic coming alone , the protestant religion immediately prevailed in his mind .: 101.58
<S> aha ! said the brigadier , stopping the servant , the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter ; we will attend upon him with a gendarme .: 71.23
<S> milady then perceived , with terror , that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed .: 67.45
<S> i have no business in london . but others wish that you should go there . but who are those others ?: 82.26
<S> as to the bastile , they are not there , though the bastile is especially for the frondeurs .: 63.16
<S> men may subdue men they can not overcome the elements .: 480.62
<S> the parents of little la valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at it ; now they begin to look concerned . nonsense !: 236.19
<S> yes , said danglars , taking it from beyond his reach ; and as what i say and do is merely in jest , and i , amongst the first and foremost , should be sorry if anything happened to dante s the worthy dante s look here ! and taking the letter , he <UNK> it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor .: 85.52
<S> milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt , but which , however , was nothing but observation , or rather the wish to <UNK> .: 52.54
<S> well , that is not impossible .: 20.01
<S> yes . what is it ? have you confidence in me ? give your orders , said the three musketeers .: 20.71
<S> at this moment he saw the light of <UNK> , gleaming in front of him like a star .: 54.63
<S> well , i tell you i will not drag my daughter before a tribunal , and give her up to the executioner !: 38.95
<S> ah , exclaimed d avrigny , in a voice in which the horror of a judge <UNK> the truth was mingled with the delight of a <UNK> making a discovery .: 85.12
<S> sir , said de winter , i thought i had already made you aware that i am weary of this persecution ; withdraw , then , or i shall call and have you turned out as you were in london .: 52.89
<S> i have brought him up .: 24.76
<S> on seeing the prince they hastened to meet him .: 30.36
<S> what reason do you assign ? my reason ? replied the young girl .: 47.88
<S> no part of the programme <UNK> , the names of the condemned persons , their crimes , and mode of punishment , all agreed with his previous information .: 153.11
<S> in a moment the door was opened , and madame de morcerf alighted , leaning on her son s arm .: 13.78
<S> all at once she paused , a livid flash darted from her eyes ; she ran to the table , emptied into mme .: 57.84
<S> still further , the jew told them that if they would sell it to him , as it would make a magnificent pendant for <UNK> , he would give five hundred pistoles for it .: 81.31
<S> he made a sign for grimaud to bring a glass for d artagnan , and grimaud obeyed as usual .: 32.16
<S> the monk ! exclaimed grimaud .: 23.08
<S> he wished to have the young man at hand not that he at all mistrusted him , but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen .: 50.97
<S> we are four of us , said d artagnan ; we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time .: 66.37
<S> in short , the king , impatient , as has been said , had come by forced marches , and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand troops .: 94.59
<S> i , your son , as you call me i will not let you ! twas the first time d artagnan had ever refused a request from athos .: 57.85
<S> the two girls looked with horror upon this shameful <UNK> , the man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galley slave .: 209.93
<S> this concerns your head , i warn you . who are you , then ? demanded d artagnan , lowering the point of his sword , but without yet surrendering it .: 39.76
<S> he turned around , recognized athos and aramis and held out his hand to them .: 24.75
<S> comminges , who was on guard that night at the palais royal , ran in .: 32.59
<S> twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house , a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress , and always thickly veiled ; she passed like a shadow through the lodge , and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot .: 102.01
<S> i hope you will be satisfied with its contents .: 20.95

<S> good ! said the sentry , you may now go on . luigi and teresa again set forward ; as they went on teresa clung tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of carbines through the trees .: 151.55
<S> i am determined to tell them all about it . be silent , you simpleton ! cried danglars , grasping him by the arm , or i will not answer even for your own safety .: 44.56
<S> both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battle field .: 130.09
<S> your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and aramis . yes , your eminence , said athos , while the two musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand .: 94.81
<S> oh , no , he was afraid to encounter him face to face . i do not condemn you , albert ; i only restrain you .: 58.06
<S> i do not wish to cause you any remorse ; believe me , then , when i swear to you that you have wronged no man , but on the contrary have benefited mankind . the man looked at the bank notes , felt them , counted them , turned pale , then red , then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water , but he had no time to reach the water jug , and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs .: 62.15
<S> danglars , more and more delighted with major cavalcanti , had offered him a seat in his carriage .: 58.78
<S> he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future .: 79.34

<S> during the darkness , as before , my supper was brought .: 61.03
<S> the usual guide from the hotel having followed them , they had paid two conductors , nor is it possible , at rome , to avoid this abundant supply of guides ; besides the ordinary cicerone , who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel , and never quits you while you remain in the city , there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monument nay , almost to each part of a monument .: 260.08
<S> answer me , do not these crimes exist ? yes , answered franz ; and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated . ah , duelling , cried the count ; a pleasant manner , upon my soul , of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance !: 106.37

<S> porthos smiled .: 18.75
<S> oh , for pity s sake ! you have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if morrel , one of my friends , had not stopped him . listen to me , my son has also guessed who you are , he <UNK> his father s misfortunes to you . madame , you are mistaken , they are not misfortunes , it is a punishment .: 55.88
<S> at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit , for he counted from the ace to the ten .: 103.99
<S> what ? said he to himself , while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out , and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom ; what ?: 74.65
<S> here , take this purse of a hundred pistoles , and pardon me . i pardon you , monseigneur ! said bonacieux , hesitating to take the purse , fearing , doubtless , that this pretended gift was but a pleasantry .: 62.62
<S> a family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal ; a family affair concerned nobody .: 101.76
<S> sir , no , and i do not know what has become of him ; so that i am really so unhappy that i weep . in fact , tears rolled down his cheeks .: 27.26
<S> dante s was a man of great simplicity of thought , and without education ; he could not , therefore , in the solitude of his dungeon , traverse in mental vision the history of the ages , bring to life the nations that had perished , and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination , and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in martin s <UNK> pictures .: 163.64
<S> what do you desire ? a bed , my lord , replied d artagnan .: 12.07
<S> that was the question .: 17.21
<S> however , you may look and see , added the lackey , raising the <UNK> entrance of the tent .: 70.55
<S> has she , then , been appointed provost of merchants ? no ; but she has become queen of paris , <UNK> interim , and since she could not venture at once to establish herself in the palais royal or the tuileries , she is installed at the hotel de ville , where she is on the point of giving an heir or an heiress to that dear duke . you didn t tell me of that , aramis . really ?: 76.25
<S> at the same time the fever , which for an instant abandoned her , returned to give <UNK> to her eyes , color to her cheeks , and <UNK> to her lips .: 79.72

<S> the day on which d artagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing , particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province .: 206.80
<S> adieu , madame , adieu ! and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held , he sprang away , running , while mme .: 62.49

<S> the place royale .: 40.72
<S> very well , very well , said the workman aloud , in excellent english .: 100.91
<S> ten minutes elapsed , during which d artagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second .: 61.38
<S> but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken .: 45.61
<S> the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his <UNK> in the hands of a friend .: 55.77
<S> patience ! cried athos ; one of our party is still wanting . the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment , for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be .: 76.79
<S> as to groslow , he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from d artagnan what he had lost to porthos , and on leaving reminded the gascon of his appointment .: 74.60
<S> what had taken place during this long sleep ?: 50.79
<S> and i also , said franz .: 18.10
<S> mine you have heard , and that is to pursue you on earth to the tribunal of men , in heaven to the tribunal of god . you persist , then ? i swear it before the god who hears me .: 58.12
<S> well , said the count , what are you doing ? you must excuse us , count , returned franz , but we have still much to do . what may that be ? we have no masks , and it is absolutely necessary to procure them . do not concern yourself about that ; we have , i think , a private room in the piazza del popolo ; i will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us , and you can dress there . after the execution ? cried franz .: 45.69
<S> your note of this morning has completely bewildered me .: 176.70
<S> noirtier ?: 158.59
<S> we discovered yesterday the truth ; what is the use of going to day to learn something else ? you really have some distrust , then ? said porthos .: 54.95
<S> surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that . no , replied the abbe , it was not of such a size as that ; but you shall judge for yourself .: 44.21
<S> he was attired as he had been on the previous evening , and waved his pocket handkerchief to his guest in token of adieu .: 45.64

<S> m. noirtier ? yes ; think you it was the poor servant s life was coveted ?: 154.43
<S> ? no ; you are right , my dear rochefort , it couldn t be for that ; but you will probably learn the reason soon . ah , indeed !: 47.34
<S> the rain of blood chapter <UNK> .: 82.49
<S> the curate then entered , followed by planchet .: 27.94
<S> it sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered , murmured the host .: 66.53
<S> absurd !: 245.43
<S> i have the power of so doing , said monte cristo .: 16.17
<S> on entering this holy place , the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with him .: 106.77
<S> tis d artagnan s sword , he said .: 20.62
<S> they might have remained much longer lost in one another , without anyone noticing their <UNK> .: 150.43
<S> he folded up the accusation quietly , and put it as quietly in his pocket ; read the examination , and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it ; perused , too , the application dated 10th april , 1815 , in which morrel , by the deputy procureur s advice , exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dante s had rendered to the imperial cause services which villefort s <UNK> rendered <UNK> .: 215.41
<S> what our enemies say of us is then true .: 127.68
<S> some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel . come when he will , it shall be kept for him .: 77.42
<S> d artagnan did not draw his sword ; porthos put his back into the sheath .: 23.71
<S> for you , monsieur , said planchet , presenting the billet to the young man .: 17.21
<S> he might have been taken for a statue .: 27.34
<S> when the emperor returned , he wrote , implored , threatened , and so energetically , that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist .: 94.81
<S> have you been , or are you , his mistress ? oh , no ! cried milady , with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth .: 29.45
<S> peppino , who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own <UNK> , struck a light and lit a torch .: 106.01
<S> the queen turned sharply round , for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice ; it was a friend who spoke thus .: 46.89
<S> as to franz , he had no letter of credit , as he lived at florence , and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight days ; he had brought but a hundred louis , and of these he had not more than fifty left .: 44.41
<S> you must not stop an instant on the way .: 31.50
<S> the fit lasted two hours ; then , more helpless than an infant , and <UNK> and paler than marble , more crushed and broken than a <UNK> trampled under foot , he fell back , doubled up in one last convulsion , and became as rigid as a corpse .: 246.43
<S> the jailer brought him his breakfast .: 49.96
<S> in the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard , the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams .: 85.25
<S> go now , at once , or i shall have you put out . i looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty .: 62.89
<S> the two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and aramis put his finger to his hat , as if to bow , athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head .: 67.98
<S> lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys , they are sentinels . your eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution , we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting us .: 158.71
<S> well , now listen . we are listening . it appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some drug , which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased him .: 117.19
<S> very good , signor pastrini , said franz ; but we must have some supper instantly , and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days . as to supper , replied the landlord , you shall be served immediately ; but as for the carriage what as to the carriage ? exclaimed albert .: 56.20
<S> you are young .: 27.41
<S> you will excuse my leaving you , said the count , turning in the direction of his box .: 27.77
<S> the men themselves were almost dead with fatigue , but hope supported them .: 105.29
<S> the barricades had been pushed as far as the palais royal .: 31.57
<S> buckingham had returned to london ; mme .: 57.41
<S> all the rest of the square was paved with heads .: 51.36
<S> what !: 14.83
<S> i was uneasy about him . why ? because you met him at my house , just after his introduction into the world , as they told me .: 53.98
<S> egad !: 25.42
<S> why , i ll wager i can go up into the belfry of the accoules , and without staggering , too ! done ! said danglars , i ll take your bet ; but tomorrow today it is time to return .: 97.89
<S> but i say no more , madame ; it is really as if i were <UNK> for you . the clock struck half past six , and a lady was announced , a friend of madame de villefort , who came to dine with her .: 31.11
<S> it is the first time he has ever been in paris .: 14.46
<S> franz waited impatiently , inhaling the <UNK> of the roasted meat , when the captain returned with a mysterious air .: 162.61
<S> the ballet lasted an hour , and had sixteen entre es .: 204.18
<S> blacas , let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to m. de villefort . villefort s eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride ; he took the cross and kissed it .: 50.78
<S> it was her husband , who had discovered the disappearance of the <UNK> , and was crying thieves ! oh , my god ! cried mme .: 41.72
<S> m. de morcerf opened the door himself , and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk , rang , and entered the open door with his servant .: 39.08
<S> if mazarin is an italian , i am a gascon . and d artagnan dressed himself in an instant .: 36.31
<S> the ambassadors .: 117.82
<S> it is only the dead who do not return . you think so , porthos ? replied the musketeer , with a sad smile which d artagnan alone understood .: 27.32
<S> the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd ; he was evidently watching for someone , but his search ended in disappointment .: 81.45
<S> at this moment grimaud came in .: 19.48
<S> they seemed awaiting orders .: 239.12
<S> they dined apart from one another , wherever they might happen to be , or rather where they could .: 67.34
<S> what is her brother in law s name ? lord de winter . where is he now ? he returned to london at the first sound of war . well , there s just the man we want , said athos .: 35.28
<S> cloud ; but instead of following the main street he turned behind the cha teau , reached a sort of retired lane , and found himself soon in front of the pavilion named .: 81.17
<S> the villefort vault formed a square of white stones , about twenty feet high ; an interior partition separated the two families , and each apartment had its entrance door .: 215.99
<S> the man in the mask .: 23.34
<S> i saw him today for the first time , and he can tell you on what occasion ; he came to demand the rent of my lodging .: 43.72
<S> you are not exactly right , m. procureur ; you must go farther back . that voice , that voice ! where did i first hear it ? you heard it for the first time at marseilles , twenty three years ago , the day of your marriage with mademoiselle de saint me ran .: 52.44
<S> athos , in his hours of gloom and these hours were frequent was extinguished as to the whole of the luminous portion of him , and his brilliant side disappeared as into profound darkness .: 172.67
<S> and what do you reckon your outfit will cost ? said d artagnan .: 45.05
<S> and her son ? florentin , his valet , thinks he is going to do the same . come this way . monte cristo took bertuccio into his study , wrote the letter we have seen , and gave it to the steward .: 51.10
<S> by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances , he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which , for the rest , the queen s letter , short but explicit , gave him the clue .: 77.84
<S> good morning , creditor , said he ; for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me . you are right , baron , answered m. de boville ; the charities present themselves to you through me ; the widows and orphans <UNK> me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you . and yet they say orphans are to be pitied , said danglars , wishing to prolong the jest .: 110.30
<S> shall i call on him as i pass ? d avrigny , said villefort , be so kind , i beseech you , as to accompany this gentleman .: 49.51
<S> the cardinal writes better than i thought .: 79.37
<S> monte cristo heard and saw nothing , or rather he only saw morrel , whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his heart .: 49.50
<S> at length felton , who had not yet looked at milady , turned toward her .: 34.10
<S> we can talk while performing that necessary task .: 247.05
<S> your father did not hesitate an instant , and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont , with a passport signed for italy .: 89.19
<S> the next day at the appointed hour they went to see athos and found him and aramis in traveling costume .: 51.18
<S> the following morning they arrived at cha lons , where the count s steamboat waited for them .: 36.53
<S> dante s did not comprehend the jest , but his hair stood erect on his head .: 31.63
<S> how , without <UNK> himself , athos procures his equipment d artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of what might become of kitty he ran at full speed across half paris , and did not stop till he came to athos s door .: 141.62
<S> you told me that ! what matters it to you , kitty ?: 42.81
<S> there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and milady s ; every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other . that s exactly the reason i won t go , said d artagnan .: 60.80
<S> dante s was alone in darkness and in silence cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead .: 89.75
<S> but this is all i have left in the world , he said , out of an immense fortune .: 27.39
<S> you are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up , and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal .: 24.85
<S> gentlemen , said he , we have been here an hour , and our wager is won ; but we will be fair players .: 49.58
<S> you have understood me , then , dear monsieur d artagnan , said milady .: 16.03
<S> to wait ! replied athos .: 29.78
<S> morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath .: 85.39
<S> no ; but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to the lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted !: 136.20
<S> in all well organized brains , the predominating idea and there always is one is sure to be the last thought before sleeping , and the first upon waking in the morning .: 384.88
<S> the countess , in reply , bowed gracefully to albert , and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz ; then , inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her , she recommended franz to take the next best , if he wished to view the ballet , and pointed to the one behind her own chair .: 103.43
<S> i thought , i must confess , that these tales , were inventions of the middle ages . yes , no doubt , but improved upon by ours .: 121.10
<S> i repeat my words , aramis , and then , if you desire it , and if they desire it , let us separate forever from our old friends . there was a solemn , though momentary silence , which was broken by aramis .: 53.72
<S> monsieur , he continued , addressing raoul , if you are not too tired , follow me . to the end of the world , my lord ! cried raoul , feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general , who seemed to him so worthy of his renown .: 49.21
<S> a fearful day , when to day we find our friends ? yes ; but under what circumstances ? tis true that our position is an awkward one ; but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done . things look black enough , replied porthos ; i understand now why aramis advised me to strangle that horrible mordaunt . silence ! cried the gascon ; do not utter that name . but , argued porthos , i speak french and they are all english . d artagnan looked at porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man can not help feeling at <UNK> of <UNK> stupidity .: 97.54
<S> you see it is yourself who have first named her you , her father . have pity on valentine !: 89.96
<S> keep the commission ; it is yours .: 37.88
<S> edmond listened intently ; an hour passed , two hours passed , and no sound was heard from the wall all was silent there .: 82.50
<S> he is my demon , apparently .: 122.24
<S> she was a perfect <UNK> , a first rate artist , wrote poetry , and composed music ; to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted , following it with an indefatigable perseverance , assisted by a <UNK> , a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer .: 294.66
<S> bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village .: 561.64
<S> then she ventured to open her eyelids , and glance over her extended arm .: 63.53
<S> albert was silent ; an instant after , the countess resumed : you came to inquire after my health ; i will candidly acknowledge that i am not well .: 75.68
<S> those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon , and carefully arranged ; such , for instance , as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the cha teau de vincennes , that of the abbe <UNK> from for l eve que ; of <UNK> from the bastille .: 144.36
<S> do you possess 400,000 francs ? inquired the notary .: 32.17
<S> i grasped the railings ; if i had relaxed my hold for a moment , i should have fallen .: 63.01
<S> the two friends made the prisoners enter the house first , whilst they stood at the door , desiring mousqueton to take the four horses to the stable .: 52.11
<S> of the important cities given up by henry iv .: 192.29
<S> as for aramis , he went off to the bishop s palace to see if he could possibly pass in with juxon to the king s presence .: 39.61
<S> i entreat you to write to me , for you form a part of my existence , and , if i may venture to tell you so , i also feel anxious .: 32.26
<S> what dost thou there , rascal ? asked comminges .: 53.62
<S> i recognized your name in it .: 41.63
<S> and he answered that monsieur bazin went to noisy . tis his custom .: 173.68
<S> bonacieux would have any suspicion .: 35.85
<S> a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly .: 61.97
<S> besides , it came into the young man s mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed , he would , perhaps , have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair .: 68.55
<S> at last his patience was exhausted .: 73.87
<S> i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say , gentlemen , your servant , mousqueton , is thirsty . what does monsieur bracieux care , think you , whether i am thirsty or not ? tis a very <UNK> wine , said blaisois , shaking his head .: 101.41
<S> ha !: 25.83
<S> then , seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy , let us go out , albert , said he ; a ride in the wood in the phaeton , or on horseback , will refresh you ; we will then return to breakfast , and you shall attend to your affairs , and i to mine . willingly , said albert ; but let us walk .: 58.10
<S> my mother pressed me to her throbbing heart , and at the distance of a few paces i saw my father , who was glancing anxiously around .: 66.48
<S> the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement , and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor .: 172.65
<S> do not give yourself the trouble , my lord , said d artagnan , with his right foot forward , his beaver in his hand , a smile on his face , we have followed your eminence step by step and here we are . yes here we are , said porthos .: 37.68
<S> aramis !: 42.26
<S> and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles , from whence a full view of the alle es de meilhan was obtained .: 45.24
<S> amid the moaning of the storm she heard the <UNK> of the file upon the bars , and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of felton through the panes .: 85.43
<S> what do i see down there by the wall , in the direction of the catalans ?: 44.65
<S> there is no <UNK> the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort , while the addition of a third , in the person of her mother s admitted lover , enabled mademoiselle danglars to defy malice and ill nature .: 181.36
<S> one thing above all the rest heightened the respect , nay almost the veneration , of danglars for cavalcanti .: 324.16
<S> it was easy to ascertain this ; but how could he risk the question ?: 34.16
<S> but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie , he rang the bell twice and bertuccio entered .: 61.17
<S> i am inclined to think so . and do you like him ? why , he pleases me in spite of franz d e pinay , who tries to convince me that he is a being returned from the other world . the countess shuddered .: 38.39
<S> his wife !: 39.75
<S> porthos , kill every one who stands in your way . and after pressing the hand of athos , d artagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward , so that he had only to plunge into the water , which was already up to his waist .: 66.62
<S> the inquiries soon commenced .: 91.74
<S> now , pistache , my good dog , jump the height of this cane for madame de montbazon . but , interposed monsieur de chavigny , it seems to me that pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for mademoiselle de pons . stop , said the duke , pistache , jump for the queen . and he raised his cane six inches higher .: 85.44
<S> then is it not , resumed the duke , the superintendent emery , who gave his son , when he was married , three hundred thousand francs and a house , compared to which the tuileries are a heap of ruins and the louvre a paltry building ? the dog again shook his head as if to say no . then , said the prisoner , let s think who it can be .: 89.82
<S> on seeing him d artagnan could hardly <UNK> an exclamation of surprise .: 57.17
<S> then he must be playing in the garden ; go and see . <UNK> no , sir ; madame de villefort sent for him half an hour ago ; he went into her room , and has not been downstairs since . a cold perspiration burst out on villefort s brow ; his legs trembled , and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch .: 78.91
<S> at first they saw nothing around them .: 37.40
<S> friends ! said athos , do you regret you have not shed our blood ? no , replied d artagnan ; i regret to see that we , hitherto united , are opposed to each other .: 60.37
<S> then your excellency is going to the hotel . <UNK> pastrini ! said the cicerone to the coachman , and the carriage drove rapidly on .: 66.10
<S> every one likes his own uniform best , my lord . myself <UNK> , and again mazarin smiled ; for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours . lord bless us !: 242.69
<S> juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it .: 68.81
<S> this method was so simple that d artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively .: 102.88
<S> two men , wrapped in their cloaks , appeared .: 31.78
<S> and you are right , said his host ; it shows you have a tendency for an oriental life .: 68.58
<S> france will not , perhaps , be always ungrateful .: 67.85
<S> are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of <UNK> ? asked the count ; are there any <UNK> respecting these dismal abodes , in which it is difficult to believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow creatures ? yes , sir ; indeed , the jailer antoine told me one connected with this very dungeon . monte cristo shuddered ; antoine had been his jailer .: 181.41
<S> hush , whispered de guiche , these are cavaliers . yes , three on horseback and three who have dismounted . can you see what they are doing ? yes , they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man . it is some cowardly assassination , said de guiche .: 83.67
<S> he answered therefore : i think , monsieur le comte , that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of bragelonne , and that gentleman he pointed to aramis had also something to tell me when i was in his convent .: 50.91
<S> valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples , round her eyes and down her cheeks .: 88.74
<S> d artagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual <UNK> .: 59.44
<S> spectre against spectre ! he murmured in a low voice , as he concluded his sentence .: 90.38
<S> come , i have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold . monte cristo perceived that the young man had turned around ; indeed , morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid , or uttering a word .: 60.27
<S> he took his seat amongst them ; they played , and i won .: 84.31
<S> felton s orders were , for the rest , executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline .: 99.91
<S> what is he looking at ?: 43.01
<S> d artagnan was looking at athos , whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king , possessing more self control , had banished from his own .: 87.74
<S> he is not curious , thought d artagnan .: 21.75
<S> another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music , and which like the <UNK> of <UNK> , served all possible <UNK> requirements .: 317.96
<S> you will tell him , in order that he may not doubt , that he came there in the costume of the great <UNK> , which the chevalier de guise was to have worn , and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles . well , monseigneur ? all the details of his coming into and going out of the palace on the night when he introduced himself in the character of an italian fortune <UNK> you will tell him , that he may not doubt the <UNK> of my information ; that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with black tears , death s heads , and <UNK> for in case of a surprise , he was to pass for the phantom of the white lady who , as all the world knows , appears at the louvre every time any great event is impending . is that all , monseigneur ? tell him also that i am acquainted with all the details of the adventure at amiens ; that i will have a little romance made of it , <UNK> turned , with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal actors in that nocturnal romance . i will tell him that . tell him further that i hold montague in my power ; that montague is in the bastille ; that no letters were found upon him , it is true , but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows , and even what he does not know . exactly . then add that his grace has , in the precipitation with which he quit the isle of re , forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain letter from madame de chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen , inasmuch as it proves not only that her majesty can love the enemies of the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of france .: 108.56
<S> perhaps , too , the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own .: 111.12
<S> his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror .: 219.69
<S> who can tell whether dante s be innocent or guilty ?: 123.52
<S> i only repeat what i have been told , and like my <UNK> i can do no more .: 50.29
<S> he knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that .: 203.44
<S> no false modesty ; take the best horse you can find .: 206.01
<S> scarcely had d artagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca , which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night .: 62.38
<S> a change . indeed ? said albert .: 41.62
<S> the eight guards were at their posts .: 44.95
<S> god would not permit such a crime ! water , water ! cried d artagnan .: 48.19
<S> a man ! the discussion is going to begin again ! said mme .: 47.37
<S> the cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon aramis and struck a blow that aramis parried with his wonted skill .: 296.04
<S> they have rarely been successful .: 62.45
<S> madame , he said , kneeling , look upon the unhappy man at your feet .: 34.38
<S> mordaunt ! cried the three friends ; tis mordaunt ! but athos ! exclaimed d artagnan .: 30.97
<S> he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz . ah , indeed ! so franz must wait .: 103.23
<S> the thing was discussed for a long time , but finally decided in his favor .: 67.25
<S> the master of la jeune ame lie , who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of edmond s value , had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits , which edmond had accepted .: 80.73
<S> but , continued she , lord wilmore had a family or friends , he must have known someone , can we not oh , it is useless to inquire , returned the count ; perhaps , after all , he was not the man you seek for .: 55.24
<S> oh , how our hearts <UNK> ; for it did , indeed , seem to be a ring which was placed there .: 133.63
<S> on grand occasions you must wear your uniform ; that will look very well .: 104.07
<S> if his eminence , said he , did not have personal motives the cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him : pardon me , said he ; but the instant your majesty considers me a prejudiced judge , i withdraw . come , said the king , will you swear , by my father , that athos was at your residence during the event and that he took no part in it ? by your glorious father , and by yourself , whom i love and <UNK> above all the world , i swear it . be so kind as to reflect , sire , said the cardinal .: 69.74
<S> but scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this noise .: 48.06
<S> he vaulted hastily from his horse , whilst planchet , with a smile on his lips , advanced toward the master of the house .: 42.19
<S> adieu !: 28.11
<S> mistrust porthos , especially , who , to please the count whom he regards as god on earth , will assist him in contriving mazarin s escape , if mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric . aramis smiled ; his smile was at once cunning and resolute .: 152.24
<S> i even think that with economy i could manage it with two thousand livres . good god ! cried she , two thousand livres !: 87.88
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> really , pray tell me all about it , for it must be interesting . father , you have heard speak of a certain bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques ? no .: 57.03
<S> embrace also our good and brave porthos .: 655.79
<S> <UNK> by my step mother , who regards him as the <UNK> of human wisdom ; admired by my father , who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so <UNK> expressed ; idolized by edward , who , notwithstanding his fear of the count s large black eyes , runs to meet him the moment he arrives , and opens his hand , in which he is sure to find some delightful present , m .: 210.59
<S> he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted <UNK> in his hand , and he had orders to blow up everything kiosk , guards , women , gold , and ali tepelini himself at the first signal given by my father .: 225.52
<S> yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy , as elsewhere , there might be an exception to the general rule .: 90.15
<S> hardly had the police officer observed comminges at the end of the rue <UNK> when he said one word to the coachman , who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before broussel s door .: 131.93
<S> i returned to the seminary .: 46.94
<S> we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance .: 84.24
<S> does your majesty wish me to drop the subject ? by no means , my dear duke ; but just stretch out your hand . which ? whichever you please there to the left . here , sire ? i tell you to the left , and you are looking to the right ; i mean on my left yes , there .: 56.96
<S> let us say no more about it . say no more about it ?: 35.25
<S> well , <UNK> your wings , and fly into superhuman regions ; fear nothing , there is a watch over you ; and if your wings , like those of <UNK> , melt before the sun , we are here to ease your fall . he then said something in arabic to ali , who made a sign of obedience and withdrew , but not to any distance .: 155.15
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish .: 40.03
<S> oh , you may speak before his excellency , said he ; he is one of my friends .: 21.48
<S> so long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol , whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here .: 180.73
<S> no one can deny his being a noble hearted young fellow . but meanwhile , continued m. morrel , here is the pharaon without a captain . oh , replied danglars , since we can not leave this port for the next three months , let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dante s will be set at liberty . no doubt ; but in the meantime ? i am entirely at your service , m. morrel , answered danglars .: 55.67
<S> so , <UNK> death to capture , i accomplished the most astonishing deeds , and which , more than once , showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision , and vigorous and determined execution .: 363.56
<S> did you say he was coming ? yes ; summoned by m. de villefort , who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married as m. danglars is to see mademoiselle euge nie settled .: 77.76
<S> but i think i have it , said athos .: 15.13
<S> still confidence was not restored to all minds , and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month .: 106.85
<S> i shall have to watch the men who pick up balls . the duke smiled .: 65.12
<S> i can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday ; but , after all , i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses , more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo , and certainly that illustrious personage , apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of , seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i , for one , delight in <UNK> at any risk , even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses .: 113.81
<S> then , lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters , and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address themselves .: 500.23
<S> it is waiting for us at greenwich , opposite the isle of dogs , <UNK> by a captain and four men , who for the sum of fifty pounds <UNK> will keep themselves at our disposition three successive nights .: 162.36
<S> then observe , too , that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex .: 175.65
<S> when we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers : comrades , he said , you are about to suffer a furious discharge ; but after that you will make short work with those fellows . there was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words ; then raising his sword , sound trumpets ! he cried . well , very good ; you will do as much when the opportunity occurs , will you , raoul ? i know not , sir , but i thought it really very fine and grand ! were you afraid , raoul ? asked the count .: 85.05
<S> if you had taken what madame de villefort has poured into your glass , valentine valentine you would have been doomed ! but , exclaimed the young girl , why am i thus pursued ? why ? are you so kind so good so <UNK> of ill , that you can not understand , valentine ? no , i have never injured her . but you are rich , valentine ; you have 200,000 livres a year , and you prevent her son from enjoying these 200,000 livres . how so ?: 75.27
<S> i remember now ; yes , it was about stop a minute yes , it was about a woman . that s it , replied athos , becoming almost livid ; that is my grand story of the fair lady , and when i relate that , i must be very drunk . yes , that was it , said d artagnan , the story of a tall , fair lady , with blue eyes . yes , who was hanged . by her husband , who was a nobleman of your acquaintance , continued d artagnan , looking intently at athos .: 48.68
<S> well ? having , then , a keeper like la ramee , i should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me , who would assist me in my flight . come , come , said la ramee , that s not a bad idea . capital , isn t it ?: 40.55
<S> we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes ; the choice is easy . it is true ; but in everything , friend , one must always return to the same question a stupid one , i admit , but very necessary have you any money ? something like a hundred pistoles , that my farmer sent to me the day before i left bragelonne ; but out of that sum i ought to leave fifty for raoul a young man must live <UNK> .: 142.01
<S> the two friends mounted , as did their servants .: 33.97
<S> then he went into the stable ; he found the five horses saddled , his own amongst the rest .: 76.45
<S> thou <UNK> not have thought so <UNK> thou known mousqueton well . so far so well , answered planchet , alighting , and extending his arms to mousqueton , the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched those who were present and made them suppose that planchet was a great lord in disguise , so highly did they <UNK> the position of mousqueton .: 202.03
<S> if your man is mine , with one blow i shall obtain two <UNK> , that s all ; but where to find this man ? i know not . have you no information as to his <UNK> place ? none .: 95.22
<S> a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells , undoubtedly , in some paternal hearts toward a son .: 193.50
<S> but what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant ? true , said m. d avrigny ; we will return . the doctor went out first , followed by m. de villefort .: 29.23
<S> you were the tool of those cowards who dared not kill her themselves ?: 227.77
<S> bravo , planchet , you are a lad of your word , and if ever you leave your master , i will promise you a place in my service . oh , no , never , said planchet , i will never leave monsieur d artagnan . at the same time d artagnan felt that planchet slipped a note into his hand .: 28.47
<S> he opened the conversation about rain and fine weather ; the travelers replied .: 177.97
<S> cromwell s house .: 83.98
<S> morrel , i believe ? said villefort .: 23.41
<S> ho , there , boy !: 97.57
<S> on this conviction i allow her to speculate , she having her bank and her <UNK> ; she <UNK> and lost .: 447.10
<S> what are these things ? replied anne , with queen like dignity , extending toward the open coffer an arm , despite the lapse of years , still beautiful .: 231.47
<S> may i inquire if you are acquainted with madame danglars ? <UNK> i have that honor ; and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the <UNK> cause of all the peril you have incurred .: 142.13
<S> light the candles in my apartment , if you please . the innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before franz with a light .: 63.25
<S> i am sure he answers my purpose , knows no impossibility , and so i keep him . then , continued cha teau renaud , since you have an establishment , a steward , and a hotel in the champs e lyse es , you only want a mistress . albert smiled .: 58.96
<S> hair sandy red more red than sandy ; gray blue eyes more gray than blue ; and for the rest , stiff and proud . let him give in his letter . his eminence asks for the letter , said bernouin , passing back into the ante chamber .: 264.80
<S> nothing , replied maximilian .: 19.78
<S> come , said d artagnan , all this leads to nothing .: 26.81
<S> a sort of smile played on his lips .: 25.52
<S> well , he asked , that will do , will it not ? yes , my lord , on one condition . what ? that grimaud shall wait on us at table . nothing could be more agreeable to the duke , however , he had presence of mind enough to exclaim : to the devil with your grimaud !: 76.00
<S> the prince , monsieur de retz , the duc de beaufort , the duc de bouillon , are talking over public affairs .: 32.90
<S> cardinalists or frondeurs , what matters it ?: 234.82
<S> the white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead , and her eyes , already sunken by the <UNK> of age , now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief .: 119.11
<S> as for raoul , he remained bewildered with what he had seen , having been forbidden by d artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over .: 40.26
<S> thank you , said luigi , drawing back his hand ; i render a service , i do not sell it . well , replied the traveller , who seemed used to this difference between the <UNK> of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer , if you refuse wages , you will , perhaps , accept a gift . ah , yes , that is another thing . then , said the traveller , take these two venetian sequins and give them to your bride , to make herself a pair of <UNK> . and then do you take this poniard , said the young herdsman ; you will not find one better carved between albano and civita <UNK> . i accept it , answered the traveller , but then the obligation will be on my side , for this poniard is worth more than two sequins . for a dealer perhaps ; but for me , who engraved it myself , it is hardly worth a piastre . what is your name ? inquired the traveller .: 75.37
<S> then he took the glass , emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace , that it might be supposed valentine had taken it , and replaced it on the table ; then he disappeared , after throwing a farewell glance on valentine , who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the lord .: 49.22
<S> he was dressed with all the english peculiarity , namely , in a blue coat , with gilt buttons and high collar , in the fashion of 1811 , a white <UNK> waistcoat , and <UNK> pantaloons , three inches too short , but which were prevented by <UNK> from slipping up to the knee .: 170.07
<S> let us add that in these times of <UNK> morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses ; and that the latter almost always left them valuable and <UNK> remembrances , as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts .: 172.98
<S> anticipating your wishes , i have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages , and ali , he whom you think so very ugly , continued he , addressing the boy with a smiling air , will have the honor of driving you home , while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash .: 110.86
<S> i neither reproach you nor hate you , my friend .: 56.00
<S> these twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at monte cristo , of which bertuccio knows the secret .: 86.99
<S> cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night , and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks , and lay down before the fire .: 77.52
<S> unfortunately , we do not live in the times of the great emperor , we live in the times of the cardinal ; and three days hence , however well the secret might be guarded , it would be known , i say , that we were to fight , and our combat would be prevented .: 53.61
<S> it is a little worse for the journey , but that s no matter . there are no horses . albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand .: 41.89
<S> you were rich when i married you , but little respected .: 91.21
<S> now , he said to teresa , are you ready to share my fortune , whatever it may be ? oh , yes ! exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically .: 28.73
<S> no , said monte cristo ; i told you i did not wish to be behind my time ; i dressed myself in the carriage , and descended at the viscount s door . the young men looked at each other ; they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing , but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity , that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false besides , why should he tell a falsehood ?: 41.39
<S> and you really mean to say ; monsieur , that my dear father is here ? yes , sir ; and i can even add that i have only just left his company .: 43.80
<S> you remarked that we were all active , vigorous and armed . yes . you are mistaken .: 98.74
<S> what would you not have accomplished if you had been free ? possibly nothing at all ; the overflow of my brain would probably , in a state of freedom , have <UNK> in a thousand follies ; misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect .: 135.41
<S> arrived at the angle of a street , he pointed to a small house , isolated , solitary , and dismal .: 54.59
<S> i , in my quality of journalist , open all the theatres to him . thanks , monsieur , returned monte cristo , my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre . is your steward also a nubian ? asked debray .: 73.87
<S> the visitor either understood the abbe s meaning , or had no more questions to ask ; he arose , and the abbe accompanied him to the door .: 52.58
<S> go to bed , planchet , and sleep soundly . my faith , monsieur !: 40.27
<S> now , then , franz , when , for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered , he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through paris merely to introduce him into society would you have me refuse ?: 313.89
<S> the procurator s wife fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud , all surrounded by duchesses and <UNK> , who cast bags of money at his feet .: 156.35
<S> of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death ? it is i who no longer understand you , madame , said felton .: 39.90
<S> oh , you beautiful , good little creature ! said milady .: 30.61
<S> bonacieux was the very life of d artagnan .: 29.43
<S> come , calm yourself , and reckon them up m .: 143.89
<S> d artagnan bent down to his horse s neck , the young man fired , and the ball severed the feathers from the hat .: 45.40
<S> the marquis de saint me ran , i think , the concierge said .: 21.74
<S> at six leagues from marseilles , after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take , he fell into such a deep sleep , that it appeared to me unnatural ; still i hesitated to wake him , although i fancied that his face was flushed , and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual .: 80.92
<S> thus m. de tre ville was praised to the highest note by these men , who adored him , and who , ruffians as they were , trembled before him like <UNK> before their master , obedient to his least word , and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash out the smallest insult .: 135.79
<S> whence came the blow ?: 273.72
<S> bertuccio , crouched in the corner of the carriage , began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed .: 82.33
<S> a thunder of applause saluted its appearance ; half the camp was at the barrier .: 163.60
<S> all these rooms , which communicated with one another , did not inspire porthos favorably .: 111.29
<S> capital ! cried the gascon , you would make a distinguished general . and do you think , asked groslow , that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard ? no , to be sure , replied d artagnan ; unless , forsooth , the sky rains friends upon him . groslow s face brightened .: 87.99
<S> the day passed in pursuing those exercises in which monte cristo excelled .: 140.52
<S> for the people had learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf , and , although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail , it had none the less won for them the people s good will .: 146.18
<S> the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work .: 46.63
<S> this demon , gout this demon , gout ! my lord , said athos , we are just arrived from england and our first concern is to inquire after your health . thanks , gentlemen , thanks !: 114.83
<S> all , all , all , are thine , my adored mistress ! and he kissed the letter with passion , without even <UNK> a look at the gold which sparkled on the table .: 88.38
<S> immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat , tied under grimaud s shoulders the end of a cord , and the remaining two , who held the other end , drew grimaud to them .: 71.00
<S> this circumstance pleased m. de tre ville much , as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between m. de la tre mouille s testimony and himself .: 142.37
<S> bazin , my friend , come here . the door opened and bazin entered ; on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair .: 36.82
<S> and you ? i shared the same fate at aquapendente . do you know , signor pastrini , said albert , lighting a second cigar at the first , that this practice is very convenient for bandits , and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own . doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising , for he only answered half the question , and then he spoke to franz , as the only one likely to listen with attention .: 86.11
<S> it is true that this provincial was a gascon ; and that , particularly at this period , the compatriots of d artagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated .: 57.86
<S> but he stopped on the landing ; he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber .: 76.07
<S> this idea imparted new energy , and in three days he had succeeded , with the utmost precaution , in removing the cement , and exposing the stone work .: 126.57
<S> still , in spite of all , you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage . he is a philanthropist , answered the other ; and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to <UNK> for the monthyon prize , given , as you are aware , to whoever shall be proved to have most <UNK> advanced the interests of virtue and humanity .: 99.72
<S> a few men , the least impressed of all by the scene , pronounced a discourse , some deploring this <UNK> death , others expatiating on the grief of the father , and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall until at length they exhausted their stores of <UNK> and mournful speeches , elaborate variations on the <UNK> of <UNK> to du pe <UNK> .: 422.27
<S> never mind in the meantime he <UNK> merce de s the lovely merce de s at least he returns to do that . during this time danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man , on whose heart caderousse s words fell like molten lead .: 106.61
<S> i like that .: 29.23
<S> poor fellow ! remarked danglars , affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart .: 37.56
<S> people do not go out from it by the door , but by the window ; one doesn t descend here by the marble steps of a peristyle , but by the branches of a lime tree ; and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this <UNK> seems to have changed his celestial name of <UNK> into that of the more terrestrial one of the prince de marsillac . aramis burst into a fit of laughter .: 149.67
<S> fernand dashed his on the ground .: 88.73
<S> well , all that was useless .: 24.92
<S> under this head , also , bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell .: 164.08
<S> the result was that when the new comer left the hotel with the cicerone , a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers , and without having been seen by the traveller , and appearing to excite no attention from the guide , followed the stranger with as much skill as a parisian police agent would have used .: 92.27
<S> you are brave , monsieur d artagnan , continued his eminence ; you are prudent , which is still better .: 24.11
<S> bonacieux , who was charged with going to fetch the duke and conducting him to the louvre , was abducted .: 36.37
<S> rochefort bent low .: 136.65
<S> in fact the rochellais had made a sortie during the night , and had <UNK> a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before .: 66.32
<S> mordaunt put his hand into the hat , took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it .: 60.44
<S> porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall , and by the aid of his friend s hand gained the summit .: 87.18
<S> then give me that letter , madame , said the chancellor .: 24.09
<S> yes , appearances were against me and i was about to suffer dishonor .: 131.62
<S> saved , said the girl ; saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the harbor . morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude .: 52.81
<S> that s where we are .: 25.50
<S> repeat your father s name , said the president .: 20.67
<S> it was then , when the count could not see albert , that he sent for his servant , who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him .: 38.14
<S> he could not endure it , and sent parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their king .: 115.89
<S> look at this ray of light which enters by my window , said the abbe , and then observe the lines traced on the wall .: 73.35
<S> this scrutiny was so much the more easy , the coachman being sound asleep .: 146.56
<S> sit down there , before me , d artagnan ; you are gentleman enough not to listen standing . and the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man , who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he obeyed .: 58.83
<S> the catacombs of saint sebastian in his whole life , perhaps , franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression , so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness , as in this moment .: 160.52
<S> i thank you , d artagnan . you are more impetuous than you were , returned d artagnan .: 19.58
<S> three months since it was m. de saint me ran ; madame de saint me ran two months since ; the other day it was barrois ; today , the old noirtier , or young valentine . you knew it ? cried morrel , in such a paroxysm of terror that monte cristo started , he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved ; you knew it , and said nothing ? and what is it to me ? replied monte cristo , shrugging his shoulders ; do i know those people ?: 59.07
<S> franz was less enthusiastic ; but the count exercised over him also the <UNK> a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering .: 370.04
<S> there was a crowd on the pier .: 26.59
<S> he then went straight to the door and knocked , murmuring , i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap , but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse ! the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased , steps approached , the door was opened , and d artagnan , sword in hand , rushed into the rooms of m. bonacieux , the door of which , doubtless acted upon by a spring , closed after him .: 78.21
<S> oh , real enough , from anxiety doubtless , at any rate they postponed the matter for two months .: 230.42
<S> milady , pale as a corpse , endeavored to cry out ; but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast .: 112.02
<S> to the sheets , said he .: 24.07
<S> the monk ! cried the host ; where is the monk ? grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard .: 41.72
<S> bonacieux once again , and satisfy himself that he had not been mistaken , that the appointment was at st .: 49.96
<S> edmond , continued she , you will see that if my face is pale , if my eyes are dull , if my beauty is gone ; if merce de s , in short , no longer resembles her former self in her features , you will see that her heart is still the same .: 57.87
<S> you had the fortitude to regain the house , assisted by your nurse .: 111.06
<S> a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour .: 492.48
<S> our partnership began in the month of april .: 128.91
<S> an italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as ourselves .: 155.76
<S> sir , said the servant , i have a favour to ask you . speak out , my friend . i am afraid to do so .: 19.10
<S> ten minutes afterwards villefort reached his hotel , ordered horses to be ready in two hours , and asked to have his breakfast brought to him .: 49.45
<S> do you permit us to open this casket ? asked the notary .: 25.39
<S> have you seen ? alas ! did you recognize ? valentine groaned .: 51.18
<S> as i am of the church , and the affair might injure me if i should share it with any other than a sure friend like you , i write to beg that you will serve me as second .: 63.25
<S> but d artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished .: 166.92
<S> he would at once approach valentine s father and acknowledge all , begging villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving hearts .: 324.58
<S> i have already told you avenge him . on whom ? on his murderers . how should i know who they are ? order them to be sought for . why , your brother has been involved in a quarrel , and killed in a duel .: 67.59
<S> can you imagine , said monte cristo , some <UNK> or abbe de ganges , one stormy , dark night , descending these stairs step by step , carrying a load , which he wishes to hide from the sight of man , if not from god ? madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort , who was obliged to support himself against the wall .: 119.44
<S> oh , the train is well laid ; the plot is clever .: 105.48
<S> teresa saw herself rich , superbly attired , and attended by a train of <UNK> domestics .: 398.71
<S> felton was a puritan ; he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet .: 67.34
<S> and here is andrea cavalcanti s baptismal register , given by the cure of saravezza . all quite correct . take these documents , then ; they do not concern me .: 124.89
<S> he did not even see the ocean , that terrible barrier against freedom , which the prisoners look upon with utter despair .: 169.03
<S> oh , heavens !: 7.91
<S> now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of kings , said d artagnan , if you persist in offering him a civility .: 63.87
<S> without opposing their arrangements , he allowed morrel , cha teau renaud , and debray to leave on horseback , and the ladies in m. de villefort s carriage .: 50.12
<S> danglars , astonished , opened the door ; but a strong hand pushed him back , and the carriage rolled on .: 38.85
<S> take care .: 27.38
<S> ah ! thought the gascon ; he looks displeased .: 79.86
<S> excuse me , my lord , said the lad ; but will you have the kindness to wait a moment ? what for , philip ? asked albert , who , being a constant visitor there , did not understand this opposition to his entrance .: 49.28
<S> he caused me to be instructed , gave me masters , and when i was thirteen years of age he sold me to the sultan <UNK> . of whom i bought her , said monte cristo , as i told you , albert , with the emerald which formed a match to the one i had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills . oh , you are good , you are great , my lord ! said hayde e , kissing the count s hand , and i am very fortunate in belonging to such a master ! albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard .: 60.10
<S> what happened to the worthy captain ? he died . fell into the sea ? no , sir , he died of brain fever in dreadful agony . then turning to the crew , he said , bear a hand there , to take in sail ! all hands obeyed , and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew , sprang to their respective stations at the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> sheets and <UNK> , the jib <UNK> , and the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> .: 242.13
<S> i was passing close to the door of the captain s cabin , which was half open , and i saw him give the packet and letter to dante s. he did not speak to me of it , replied the shipowner ; but if there be any letter he will give it to me . danglars reflected for a moment .: 35.20
<S> an hour before daybreak , cucumetto aroused his men , and gave the word to march .: 93.19
<S> a fanatic has just assassinated him . ah , said rochefort , with a smile ; this is a fortunate chance one that will delight his eminence !: 68.36
<S> this was a question the young man asked himself , whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed , being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted lover .: 213.65
<S> all very fine , my lord , but at the very first hint you give of such a thing i will strangle you and become frondist .: 89.94
<S> everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba , a return which was <UNK> in the past , and will probably remain without a <UNK> in the future .: 122.29
<S> more closely watched than ever , the queen felt certain , without knowing how to tell which , that one of her women had betrayed her .: 104.34
<S> if they meant to execute him at la gre ve , it could scarcely be worth while to gag him , as they had nearly reached the place of execution .: 98.48
<S> for tell me , where can you find a love like mine a love which neither time , nor absence , nor despair can extinguish , a love which contents itself with a lost ribbon , a stray look , or a chance word ?: 309.76
<S> groslow jumped in , followed by mordaunt , and in five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then crowded the outskirts of london ; and mordaunt could discern the little vessel riding at anchor near the isle of dogs .: 168.09
<S> these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man .: 64.14
<S> madame de chevreuse , whose name appears so often in our story the three musketeers , without her actually having appeared in any scene , was still a beautiful woman .: 111.89
<S> now i may hope that god will forgive me , since my crime is <UNK> . explain yourself . said grimaud .: 67.01
<S> the two musketeers , who loved their ease , brought a chair for each of themselves and one for athos .: 88.52
<S> yes , said he at length , it is so .: 17.88
<S> this is a boy , tre ville , a mere boy !: 36.60
<S> you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct , and for a man of your intelligence , this plan is as easy as it is necessary ; you must form honorable friendships , and by that means <UNK> the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life . andrea visibly changed countenance .: 163.28
<S> enter , gentlemen , and be kind enough to wait for me ; i shall not be more than half an hour . and while the three musketeers entered the ground floor room , the cardinal , without asking further information , ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him .: 47.08
<S> or sully , louis xiii .: 139.82
<S> a surgeon , reverend sir a surgeon ! said caderousse .: 77.81
<S> come , said he , this matter will want a good deal of talking over ; a retractation is always a serious thing , you know .: 68.43
<S> what mean you by that ? they have eyes , cried milady , but they see not ; ears have they , but they hear not . yes , yes ! said felton , passing his hands over his brow , covered with sweat , as if to remove his last doubt .: 73.02
<S> athos was introduced and announced by name .: 103.04
<S> that s my masterpiece .: 69.57
<S> my faith , it appears so ! said d artagnan .: 13.98
<S> himself , who took a pride in being considered a past master therein .: 390.75
<S> am i , or am i not , the queen ?: 36.78
<S> the king , as we have said , was to follow as soon as his bed of justice had been held ; but on rising from his bed of justice on the twenty eighth of june , he felt himself attacked by fever .: 49.57
<S> i have lost my appetite , and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something . noirtier did not lose a word of what valentine said .: 63.23
<S> the next morning d artagnan summoned the host , one of those sly <UNK> who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer .: 194.61
<S> you will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements .: 89.59
<S> i possessed a thousand francs .: 42.65
<S> the queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to her .: 53.79
<S> the host , who saw two young noblemen , richly clad , promised everything they required , and our two cavaliers , after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun , started off again and proceeded rapidly toward greney .: 252.83
<S> but there is nothing which would do ! nothing ! <UNK> oh , sir , cried barrois , are you going to let me die without help ?: 56.98
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> but , resumed la ramee , that is only a way of corresponding . and that is a great deal , it seems to me . but not enough . pardon me ; for instance , i say to my friends , be on a certain day , on a certain hour , at the other side of the moat with two horses . well , what then ? la ramee began to be uneasy ; unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you . that s not needed .: 51.39
<S> the count watched him .: 14.07
<S> bowed down with fatigue , she was indeed confined to her bed ; and it was in her own room , and from the lips of madame de villefort , that she heard all the strange events we have related ; we mean the flight of euge nie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti , or rather benedetto , together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him .: 71.22
<S> when i am insulted i do not faint ; i avenge myself ! and she made a sign for kitty to leave the room .: 42.42
<S> oh , sir ! planchet only touched the tips of the count s fingers .: 36.32
<S> some voices even added : long live the marshal ! but all took up the cry in chorus : down with mazarin ! the crowd gave place , the barricade was opened , and the marshal , with the remnant of his company , retreated , preceded by friquet and his bandits , some of them making a presence of beating drums and others imitating the sound of the trumpet .: 205.98
<S> but is there anything impossible for my d artagnan , the noble and loyal gentleman ? oh , i can not believe you ! well , read , then ! said the unhappy young woman , in the excess of her pride and joy , presenting a letter to milady .: 50.10
<S> valentine , by means of her love , her patience , and her devotion , had learned to read in noirtier s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind .: 52.94
<S> then you were about to tell me all the isolation of your life , the griefs of your heart .: 27.96
<S> luigi arrived first .: 117.27
<S> but were you not on horseback ?: 29.84
<S> he was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times beheld the image in his dreams a coffer long and deep , locked , bolted , fastened in the wall ; a coffer of which he had so often heard , and which the hands a little wrinkled , it is true , but still not without elegance of the procurator s wife were about to open to his admiring looks .: 114.77
<S> fourteen years ! repeated the count .: 22.36
<S> after dinner morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the <UNK> <UNK> , and read the <UNK> ; this day he did not leave the house , but returned to his office .: 120.01
<S> that was not the appointed hour .: 65.70
<S> holloa , there ! cried he ; what do you want , you strumpet ?: 39.63
<S> my kingdom is bounded only by the world , for i am not an italian , or a frenchman , or a hindu , or an <UNK> , or a spaniard i am a <UNK> .: 96.59
<S> you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon ? then pursued the young man eagerly .: 152.12
<S> i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her <UNK> to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution . thus , then , it is your opinion , said anne of austria , with a sneer and biting her lips with rage , that yesterday s riot , which to day is already a rebellion , to morrow may become a revolution ? yes , madame , replied the coadjutor , gravely .: 76.71
<S> who ever heard of such an occurrence as this ? a false telegraphic despatch it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two <UNK> .: 267.29
<S> grimaud begins his functions .: 101.17
<S> his presentiments were realized , as we shall see , and his uneasy forebodings had <UNK> him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut trees .: 201.41
<S> how i have searched for him , replied villefort , wringing his hands ; how i have called him in my long sleepless nights ; how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men , and to find mine among them !: 97.47
<S> ah , m. andrea , said the latter , with his half jesting tone ; how do you do ? charmingly , as you see .: 26.25
<S> i never play , for i am not rich enough to afford to lose , or sufficiently poor to desire to gain .: 88.27
<S> he held the knife with which milady had stabbed herself , open in his bosom ; at one bound he was upon the duke .: 62.69
<S> the queen was ignorant where the mercer s young wife was , but had promised to have her sought for ; but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure d artagnan .: 83.85
<S> la carconte , on the contrary , rose , and going with a firm step towards the door , opened it , saying , as she did so : come in , dear m. joannes . ma foi , said the jeweller , drenched with rain , i am not destined to return to beaucaire tonight .: 47.63
<S> eh , monsieur , eh ! friend , said d artagnan , a half pistole for that paper ! my faith , monsieur , with great pleasure !: 42.20
<S> she had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity .: 81.50
<S> the two friends repaired to athos s , and he , faithful to his vow of not going out , took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them .: 68.35
<S> he pressed his burning lips to the cheeks , but they were icy cold and pale ; he felt the stiffened limbs ; he pressed his hand upon the heart , but it no longer beat , the child was dead .: 64.19
<S> now , if you will come on board , m. morrel , said dante s , observing the owner s impatience , here is your supercargo , m. danglars , coming out of his cabin , who will furnish you with every particular .: 48.02
<S> listen , replied felton , in a low voice .: 10.73
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> yes , monsieur , replied d artagnan ; here it is . ah , ah !: 8.57
<S> me !: 92.43
<S> what is the day of the month ? asked he of jacopo , who sat down beside him .: 22.63
<S> if your friends are the more speedy , you are to be saved ; if the satellites of the cardinal , you are lost . oh , yes , yes ; lost beyond redemption !: 69.60
<S> the sergeant answered that puritans never drank , and put the crown piece in his pocket .: 135.61
<S> still further , athos obtained of m. de tre ville six days instead of four , and introduced into these six days two more nights for they set out on the twenty fourth at five o clock in the evening , and as a further kindness m. de tre ville post dated the leave to the morning of the twenty fifth .: 120.18
<S> yes , said he .: 5.77
<S> but what <UNK> her ?: 161.32
<S> now go and tell athos and aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch him .: 68.46
<S> pray be assured of that . franz took his hat and went away in haste .: 59.72
<S> he was thought to be dead ; his wife , especially , who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow , stoutly maintained that death had taken him .: 124.95
<S> go on ! your advice , then ? to take the hundred pistoles , d artagnan .: 24.87
<S> well , said d artagnan , one is never killed in a first engagement . nor in the second , said aramis nor in the third , returned porthos ; and even when one is killed , one rises again , the proof of which is , that here we are ! no , said athos , it is not raoul about whom i am anxious , for i trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman ; and if he is killed well , he will die bravely ; but hold should such a misfortune happen well athos passed his hand across his pale brow .: 81.83
<S> comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of louvieres appearing at the window of the second floor .: 99.78
<S> then wait , said aramis ; and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed , he took one of the muskets from tony , <UNK> and aimed it at the young man , who stood , like the accusing angel , upon the rock .: 106.79
<S> that evening he had a long conference with several friends ; and m. cavalcanti , who had remained in the drawing room with the ladies , was the last to leave the banker s house .: 30.50
<S> read ! said he , read !: 39.76
<S> good by !: 335.70
<S> i took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended count if he were a real count he wouldn t be so rich .: 107.61
<S> the lowest or the least known of them , as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company , was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother .: 54.15
<S> it is mine , and i am at liberty to dispose of it .: 19.77
<S> behind him , <UNK> than the sea , <UNK> than the sky , rose phantom like the vast stone structure , whose projecting <UNK> seemed like arms extended to seize their prey , and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures .: 512.61
<S> from lyons to <UNK> still by steamboat . . 16 .: 2329.61
<S> my lord , have you any commands ? asked bernouin .: 28.73
<S> albert returned safely then the count was revenged .: 151.52
<S> come , continued d artagnan , who , irritated that instead of listening to him athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts , you have never found yourself the worse for my advice .: 55.08
<S> all four , besides , immediately broke off their conversation .: 94.94
<S> he who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness .: 351.80
<S> i know him ; not personally , but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman . you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal ? oh , no , certainly not ! well , reveal your secret to him , and ask him whether , however important , however valuable , however terrible it may be , you may not confide it to me . but this secret is not mine , and i can not reveal it in this manner . you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux , said d artagnan , with <UNK> .: 59.17
<S> it was one of those perfumed gloves that lovers like to snatch from a pretty hand .: 105.95
<S> on entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard , then , mounting a staircase , had opened a door , and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk .: 86.26
<S> the same evening some friends of mine visited me , m .: 139.37
<S> i should lose myself in the cardinal s opinion .: 35.02
<S> felton had not spoken .: 36.92
<S> i recognize the coadjutor by his frondist hat . and i the duc de beaufort by his white plume of <UNK> feathers . they are coming , full gallop ; the prince is with them ah !: 209.87
<S> you <UNK> it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all ; and while we are still gaping with wonder at the news , you come and tell us today , let us say no more about it . well , then , let us talk about it , since you desire it , replied aramis , patiently .: 61.71
<S> daggers and swords were just about to shine , when suddenly the door was thrown open and harrison appeared in the doorway , accompanied by a man enveloped in a large cloak .: 51.43
<S> two shots were fired at once , one by d artagnan , the other by the adversary of porthos .: 29.96
<S> silence , silence , begone ! said kitty .: 35.92
<S> the host proved to be a worthy man , as bald as a <UNK> .: 85.84
<S> on reflection , my dear du vallon , it is a great honor for the comte de la fere , and gives good reason to hope .: 34.03
<S> you have heard what i said ?: 30.42
<S> and i , he said , i feel that my place is not in the judge s seat , but on the prisoner s bench . <UNK> you ? said madame danglars .: 44.68
<S> deuce take it all the worse for me ! how ? there is no doubt but that one of the chief <UNK> of a courtier is to know when to forget . but you , guitant , are not a courtier .: 92.25
<S> s blood !: 40.04
<S> this website includes information about project gutenberg , including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation , how to help produce our new ebooks , and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks .: 72.62
<S> in fact , the count s face brightened .: 28.47
<S> he launched into a <UNK> of his eminence , and said that he should not have failed to enter into the guards of the cardinal instead of the king s guards if he had happened to know m. de cavois instead of m. de tre ville .: 35.58
<S> monsieur le comte , monsieur le chevalier , if ever i am king sire , you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to , therefore gratitude is on our side .: 190.30
<S> recovering himself , however , he wiped the perspiration from his brows , and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived .: 34.33
<S> when daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream ; he was thirsty , and dragged himself towards it .: 53.54
<S> uncertainty is still hope . then in a low voice morrel added , this delay is not natural .: 161.00
<S> no , but it will be , said caderousse , as surely as dante s will be captain of the pharaon eh , danglars ? danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack , and turned to caderousse , whose countenance he scrutinized , to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated ; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness .: 121.44
<S> he had to contend against a strong wrist , but his agility was superior to all force .: 103.95
<S> which is the nearest way ?: 71.50
<S> the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbe faria ; but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly , for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dante s .: 128.45
<S> even ali , who had hastened to obey the count s summons , went forth from his master s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold ; while , as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patron s meditations , whatever they were , the faithful nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door , holding his breath , lest its <UNK> sound should <UNK> his master s happy reverie .: 292.60
<S> planchet , very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord , thought he would make all ready , like an intelligent man ; and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master s guests , named fourreau , and the false soldier who had tried to kill d artagnan and who , belonging to no corps , had entered into the service of d artagnan , or rather of planchet , after d artagnan had saved his life .: 82.35
<S> my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not intoxicated . they continued at their best speed for two hours , although the horses were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse service .: 102.08
<S> at the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open . and the monk ? exclaimed the executioner , did you see the monk ? what monk ? the monk that was shut in with me . no , he was no longer here ; he appears to have fled by the window .: 55.42
<S> could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits , and some of those delicious partridges , of which you used to make <UNK> at the hotel ?: 152.50
<S> mazarin disappeared as they rose from table .: 111.12
<S> now , said d artagnan to himself , noticing that silent play of countenance , i am sure of it . i hope the accident has been of no consequence ? they don t yet know , sir , on account of the swelling ; but the doctor is afraid some <UNK> has been injured . at this moment a little boy , half peasant , half foot boy , came to announce supper .: 84.59
<S> and what kind of a man ? a genuine englishman , your eminence .: 59.80
<S> he came to request his master to return to his lodgings , where his presence was urgent , as he piteously said .: 59.02
<S> not at all , said cha teau renaud , slowly ; i think he is violently agitated .: 34.87
<S> but when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other , the people , catching sight of him whom they called their liberator , uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle .: 159.88
<S> i slept here last night and the night before , and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed . then , said mordaunt , your honor gives me my liberty for to night ? and even for all day to morrow , if you want it .: 57.78
<S> mazarin bowed .: 34.86
<S> my intention , said mazarin , is not that you go with a great following ; my plans require secrecy , and would be <UNK> by a too extravagant equipment . still , my lord , i can t travel on my pay , for it is now three months behind ; and i can t travel on my <UNK> , for in my twenty two years of service i have accumulated nothing but debts . mazarin remained some moments in deep thought , as if he were fighting with himself ; then , going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock , he took from it a bag of silver , and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to d artagnan : take this , he said with a sigh , tis merely for your journey . if these are spanish <UNK> , or even gold crowns , thought d artagnan , we shall yet be able to do business together . he saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket .: 92.83
<S> he remembered those interesting stories , so little believed in paris , respecting roman bandits ; he remembered the adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle euge nie .: 123.67
<S> thank you , said monte cristo ; now you must permit me to take my leave of you . you said before that you were obliged to leave us , monsieur , said madame de villefort , and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject . indeed madame , said monte cristo : i scarcely know if i dare tell you where i am going . nonsense ; say on . well , then , it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes <UNK> for hours together . what is it ? a telegraph .: 42.03
<S> yes , yes , replied he , i perceive that plainly ; but do you really believe it is she ? i am sure of it . nevertheless , i confess i still doubt . but the fleur de lis on her shoulder ? she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france , and has been branded in consequence . athos , she is your wife , i tell you , repeated d artagnan ; only reflect how much the two <UNK> resemble each other . yes ; but i should think the other must be dead , i hanged her so effectually . it was d artagnan who now shook his head in his turn .: 50.61
<S> this is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of age .: 26.13
<S> there are four men come to arrest me .: 27.20
<S> in the first place , i have never succeeded by that means .: 19.93
<S> it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death !: 124.65
<S> the others , my lord ! the second i heard his name by chance ; for before fighting us , these four gentlemen told us their names ; the second was called the comte de la fere .: 62.23
<S> leave me a small supply of biscuit , a gun , powder , and balls , to kill the kids or defend myself at need , and a pickaxe , that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me . but you ll die of hunger , said the patron .: 130.90
<S> the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts .: 62.40
<S> what man is that ?: 25.39
<S> as monte cristo approached , she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the <UNK> , and extending to him her other hand , said , with a smile of captivating sweetness , in the sonorous language spoken by the women of athens and <UNK> : why demand permission ere you enter ?: 154.04
<S> he has shown very great courage and resolution , for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us , and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces .: 104.22
<S> well , once returned from the country , half by the protection of her cousin , half through what we have personally done for her , we shall obtain from the queen what we desire .: 97.70
<S> order , my lord , he said ; i am ready to obey your eminence . monsieur d artagnan , continued the cardinal , you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign . your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor .: 56.06
<S> he preferred to use the sitting room upstairs , which was more library than parlor , and was furnished with theological books and parchments , in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time , according to his valet de chambre .: 119.85
<S> it is sacrilege to struggle against so many things , my lord .: 42.72
<S> be not alarmed at what i say ; i want to be convinced .: 50.29
<S> it s a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage , and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me , for it was at my house you met this young cavalcanti , whom i do not really know at all . but i do . have you made inquiry ? is there any need of that !: 58.65
<S> the count then hastened to us , and took us into his house , where he <UNK> recalled my poor edward to life .: 124.06
<S> peppino glided first into this <UNK> ; after they got along a few paces the passage widened .: 352.84
<S> d artagnan , who had no settled habits of his own , as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him , fell easily into the habits of his friends .: 53.56
<S> i speak as one who <UNK> you , mademoiselle . mademoiselle , cried valentine ; mademoiselle !: 97.51
<S> do i know ? said he ; and do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer ?: 106.17
<S> to take spies and hang them , to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea , to imagine wild plans , and to execute them coolly such were the <UNK> which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais , a prey to famine and anxiety , but even to the cardinal , who blockaded them so closely .: 252.92
<S> go away , he said ; your repentance is too recent to inspire confidence .: 83.55
<S> bonacieux , and was expressed in these terms : there are many thanks to be offered to you , and to be transmitted to you .: 64.30
<S> do you know what that warning was ? no , i only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh <UNK> of the cardinal . yes , that s it , no doubt ! said milady , returning the letter to mme .: 56.48
<S> i have , during those five and twenty years , spared no pains to understand the people of france and the interests which were confided to me ; and now , when i see the <UNK> of my wishes almost within reach , the power i hold in my hands bursts and <UNK> me to atoms ! sire , it is fatality ! murmured the minister , feeling that the pressure of circumstances , however light a thing to destiny , was too much for any human strength to endure .: 108.01
<S> a large cloak was spread at the stern ; the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak , and placed himself beside her .: 62.88
<S> i have therefore believed , monseigneur , knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time , that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the french kingdom and leave to her own the new government of england .: 104.99
<S> when the te deum was over , the coadjutor , without stopping to change his <UNK> dress , took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well .: 81.75
<S> and since when have you become afraid of a quarrel ? i am always afraid of a quarrel when i am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it .: 117.72
<S> as to you , that is not my concern , and i shall sup either with or without your permission . the young man s eyes kindled in secret , but he restrained himself .: 44.77
<S> franz now listened to it for the third time ; yet its notes , so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions , <UNK> through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it .: 335.12
<S> say no more , i entreat you .: 30.95
<S> in the morning , i shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming , and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness i have enjoyed in your presence ; then too , when alone , i can call forth mighty pictures of the past , see vast horizons bounded only by the <UNK> mountains of pindus and olympus .: 216.83
<S> la jeune ame lie left it three quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica .: 68.09
<S> the moon , which had shone for a short time , disappeared behind the clouds ; every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert , the ocean , and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the <UNK> billows .: 155.74
<S> and not without a deal of trouble , too . has the executioner left london ? asked athos .: 91.13
<S> i want a letter that will enable me to reach the king s presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience ; that would occasion a loss of precious time . but address yourself to the keeper of the seals ; he has the right of entry at the tuileries , and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night . doubtless ; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him .: 87.89
<S> i have just left the count , sir , said he ; he is , doubtless , a delightful man but <UNK> peculiar in his ideas .: 62.93
<S> now if i die , say to d artagnan that i love him as a son , and embrace him for me .: 42.34
<S> well , said he to the young girl , are you willing , my dear kitty , that i should give you a proof of that love which you doubt ? what love ? asked the young girl .: 20.25
<S> it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz d e pinay . villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered .: 48.21
<S> a most lovely creature , upon my soul ! was his verdict .: 98.48
<S> valentine instantly ran down .: 60.66
<S> is it you , aramis ? said porthos .: 8.83
<S> a signed statement chapter 76 .: 205.03
<S> he is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling , but a sort of <UNK> , a <UNK> , a <UNK> .: 183.01
<S> you know no one but monsieur de tre ville ? he asked .: 11.51
<S> well , then , i should say , for instance , resumed danglars , that if after a voyage such as dante s has just made , in which he touched at the island of elba , someone were to denounce him to the king s procureur as a bonapartist agent i will denounce him ! exclaimed the young man hastily .: 49.73
<S> monsieur , said the count to albert , i do not ask you to accompany me to my house , as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry , and i have , as you know , a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise .: 48.39
<S> i am going to fight because i am going to fight , answered porthos , reddening .: 20.28
<S> the bell of monte <UNK> , which only sounds on the pope s decease and the opening of the carnival , was ringing a joyous peal .: 187.53
<S> her countenance , with surprising <UNK> , had recovered its gracious expression ; but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came .: 227.63
<S> at any rate , said she , since i am to be married whether i will or not , i ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my engagement with m. albert de morcerf , or i should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man . it is true , said the baroness , with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies , and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive them , it is very true that had not the morcerfs hesitated , my daughter would have married monsieur albert .: 88.15
<S> no ; i hope that when he sees me leave you , he will come out . that is possible go . i am going , said albert , as he made his parting bow .: 38.90
<S> but athos , porthos , and aramis quickly appeared in their turn , and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion , drove them back .: 49.19
<S> let our readers reassure themselves .: 500.66
<S> athos and aramis entered last and locked the door behind them .: 31.06
<S> i will send word to the governor . very well , returned dante s , <UNK> the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad .: 54.19
<S> morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches , and of her footstep on the gravel , then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of <UNK> to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved , and then also disappeared .: 123.96
<S> then the idea seized him that he had read <UNK> , and that the appointment was for eleven o clock .: 47.41
<S> god has not cursed me then , i cried , since he permits me to save the life of a human creature , in exchange for the life i have taken away . <UNK> and what did you do with the child ? asked monte cristo .: 52.11
<S> what can he be looking for ? thought edmond .: 30.41
<S> speak out , there s a worthy fellow . your excellencies are aware , responded the landlord , swelling with importance , that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves ! i should think we did know it , exclaimed albert , since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms , like two poor <UNK> in the back streets of paris . when , then , the count of monte cristo , hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed , has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli . the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise .: 81.64
<S> the two travelers proceeded to the rue saint dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel , surmounted with the arms of de luynes .: 36.14
<S> porthos , seeing this , <UNK> his mustache , elongated his imperial a second time , and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir , and who not only was a beautiful lady , but still further , no doubt , a great lady for she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt , and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass .: 129.17
<S> i understand you or rather , i am wrong .: 32.88
<S> the judges , proud of having a monarch to humiliate , evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had <UNK> to themselves , and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to <UNK> his head .: 166.41
<S> if you had only to deal with four men , d artagnan , i would allow you to go alone .: 23.38
<S> the house of morrel son anyone who had quitted marseilles a few years previously , well acquainted with the interior of morrel s warehouse , and had returned at this date , would have found a great change .: 113.38
<S> athos counseled d artagnan to dismiss the fellow ; porthos was of the opinion that he should give him a good <UNK> first ; and aramis contended that a master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him .: 135.31
<S> but , said aramis , if they dare to condemn their king , it can only be to exile or imprisonment . d artagnan whistled a little air of incredulity .: 89.03
<S> on the eleventh the queen in going to mass at notre dame , as she always did on <UNK> , was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice .: 209.97
<S> i will sit facing stuart , whom i like so much to see , especially where he now is , and you , monsieur d artagnan , opposite to me . athos turned red with rage .: 75.88
<S> i had , replied the count .: 13.24
<S> it resulted , then , from this habit that on the said first monday of april , 1625 , the citizens , on hearing the clamor , and seeing neither the red and yellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu , rushed toward the <UNK> of the jolly miller .: 144.78
<S> nothing good , replied d artagnan , shaking his head .: 12.78
<S> a complicated affair , said porthos ; where will you begin ? it is arranged capitally ; his eminence expects me in half an hour . good . my friend , said d artagnan , turning to the servant , tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command . it is very fortunate , resumed the gascon , when the valet had retired , that he did not meet the other one . do you not think that they have sent for you , both for the same thing ? i do not think it , i am certain of it . quick , quick , d artagnan .: 35.18
<S> a conjugal scene chapter <UNK> .: 197.72
<S> in fact , porthos could be heard snoring through the partition .: 72.46
<S> thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor , having his back towards the window , his elbow resting on the <UNK> <UNK> which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment , a conversation which assumed , as in the case of the <UNK> with danglars and morcerf , a turn analogous to the persons , if not to the situation .: 140.43
<S> you want valentine , do you not ?: 24.46
<S> anne of austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one .: 50.56
<S> as for the queen , furious , and left to her own <UNK> , she went for the marechal de la meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry .: 52.99
<S> then , as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel , milady could hear a vast roaring , which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some <UNK> <UNK> .: 149.41
<S> should you like to be rich , and your own master ? parbleu ! said the young man ; was it possible there could be two answers to such a question ? take the post chaise which you will find waiting at the porte de ge <UNK> , as you enter nice ; pass through turin , chambe ry , and pont de beauvoisin .: 106.32
<S> oh , yes , returned monte cristo ; i make no secret of it .: 16.66
<S> i have , replied the duke , a way of descending from the ramparts . what ? a rope ladder . yes , but , answered la ramee , trying to laugh , a ladder of ropes can t be sent around a ball , like a letter . no , but it may be sent in something else . in something else in something else ?: 70.39
<S> edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows .: 51.12
<S> special rules , set forth in the general terms of use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg electronic works to protect the project gutenberg concept and trademark .: 30.15
<S> this did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as possible whenever he met him , or from asking in the kindest tone , well , monsieur cardinal , how fares it with that poor jussac and that poor bernajoux of yours ? chapter vii .: 157.60
<S> well , then , let it be war !: 18.39
<S> he is dead . villefort drew back a few steps , and , clasping his hands , exclaimed , with real amazement and sympathy , dead ? and so soon too ! yes , it is very soon , said the doctor , looking at the corpse before him ; but that ought not to astonish you ; monsieur and madame de saint me ran died as soon .: 42.79
<S> to think of the parisians , <UNK> d artagnan , offering only the other day , by an edict of the parliament , six hundred thousand francs to any man <UNK> who would deliver up the cardinal to them , dead or alive if alive , in order to hang him ; if dead , to deny him the rites of christian burial ! come , said anne , tis reasonable , since you only ask from a queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed ; and she signed an order for a hundred thousand francs .: 140.78
<S> international donations are gratefully accepted , but we can not make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states .: 42.35
<S> after the reward of his devotion , that of his love was to come .: 48.22
<S> now , as they had already traveled eleven leagues , d artagnan thought it time to stop , whether porthos were or were not in the inn .: 66.61
<S> how ?: 28.72
<S> he is saved ! cried dante s in a paroxysm of delight .: 21.21
<S> all the world was occupied with the ceremony , so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed .: 59.79
<S> i bought two thirds of the shares of that company ; as you had foreseen , the shares <UNK> in value , and i picked up a million , from which 250,000 francs were paid to you for pin money .: 125.87
<S> lover and husband chapter xix .: 209.08
<S> well , he thought of me , when he saw the king was taken , and as they were passing before the house he begged in the king s name that they would stop , as the king was hungry .: 37.53
<S> he had at first an idea of crossing by the ferry ; but on gaining the riverside , he had mechanically put his hand into his pocket , and perceived that he had not wherewithal to pay his passage .: 46.36
<S> the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot , and sent la houdinie re , his captain of the guards , to inquire what was going on .: 82.43
<S> say , rather , crime ! replied the doctor .: 39.10
<S> athos took her hand and kissed it .: 19.76
<S> pray relate it to me ! caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments , then said , no , truly , it would take up too much time . well , my good friend , returned the abbe , in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part , you are at liberty , either to speak or be silent , just as you please ; for my own part , i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments ; so let the matter end .: 60.92
<S> why , count , exclaimed euge nie , what has happened to your ward ?: 23.55
<S> let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little fog . yes , said porthos , twill be at least a little change from beer . chapter lxiii .: 83.63
<S> alas ! said d artagnan , with the most sentimental air he could assume , can you be cruel enough to put such a question to me to me , who , from the moment i saw you , have only breathed and sighed through you and for you ? milady smiled with a strange smile .: 42.81
<S> the indictment the judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence ; the jury took their seats ; m. de villefort , the object of unusual attention , and we had almost said of general admiration , sat in the armchair and cast a tranquil glance around him .: 71.16
<S> this enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table .: 86.57
<S> in about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau ; those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding country .: 131.32
<S> you will be able to indulge all your fancies ; besides , should you find your income insufficient , you can , for the sake of the past , madame , make use of mine ; and i am ready to offer you all i possess , on loan . thank you , sir thank you , replied the baroness ; you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires , who intends for some time , at least , to retire from the world . debray was , for a moment , surprised , but immediately recovering himself , he bowed with an air which seemed to say , as you please , madame . madame danglars had until then , perhaps , hoped for something ; but when she saw the careless bow of debray , and the glance by which it was accompanied , together with his significant silence , she raised her head , and without passion or violence or even hesitation , ran downstairs , <UNK> to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her .: 68.27
<S> a sigh escaped him .: 45.81
<S> treat her as one of your <UNK> .: 202.92
<S> m. noirtier , who , on the previous night , was the old jacobin , the old senator , the old <UNK> , laughing at the guillotine , the cannon , and the dagger m .: 99.86
<S> ah , said cavalcanti to himself , if i only had that britzka , those two good post horses , and above all the passport that carries them on ! and he sighed deeply .: 115.40
<S> this moment was frightful ; if i had any doubts as to my misfortune , these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality .: 154.82
<S> this time , however , due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape .: 89.49
<S> d artagnan will give each of us his instructions .: 53.48
<S> the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to d artagnan a fine <UNK> , shining with <UNK> and pistoles , and showed to porthos a blue ribbon and a <UNK> mantle ; they were , in fact , asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed .: 192.86
<S> this valet , whose name was germain , and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master , held in one hand a number of papers , and in the other a packet of letters , which he gave to albert .: 49.31
<S> d artagnan returned to help porthos , if porthos needed help ; but porthos , for his part , had done his work as conscientiously as d artagnan .: 62.41
<S> so to night , mordaunt , go to greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca lightning .: 120.38
<S> at what time you please , sir , replied franz .: 11.59
<S> tell me , sir , could you have the courage to do so ? yes , morrel , said monte cristo , with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young man s excitement ; yes , i would do so . you ? exclaimed morrel , with increasing anger and reproach you , who have deceived me with false hopes , who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises , when i might , if not have saved her , at least have seen her die in my arms !: 49.24
<S> you pledge yourself to that , marshal ? added gondy , turning to la meilleraie .: 134.63
<S> besides , the scriptures say , confess yourselves to one another , and i confess to you , d artagnan . and i give you absolution beforehand .: 54.50
<S> unhappy girl , replied euge nie , unhappy girl , do you say , sir ?: 40.88
<S> other turnkeys came , and then was heard the regular <UNK> of soldiers .: 355.85
<S> at the first glance , d artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy .: 35.57
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> when the transports of the two lovers were calmer , milady , who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that d artagnan had , was the first to return to reality , and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his mind .: 69.38
<S> the man was wrapped up in a large cloak .: 18.18
<S> friends , he said , we must leave this craft at once or we are dead men . bah ! said athos , are you still afraid ? do you know who is captain of this vessel ? no . captain groslow . the shudder of the three musketeers showed to d artagnan that his words began to make some impression on them .: 58.45
<S> at the same time the count appeared to increase in stature , his form , nearly double its usual height , stood out in relief against the red tapestry , his black hair was thrown back , and he stood in the attitude of an avenging angel .: 81.38
<S> now , the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarter day payment , and scarron , as usual , had sent his servant to get his money at the pension office , but the man had returned and said that the government had no more money to give monsieur scarron .: 119.86
<S> set out for naples , the <UNK> , or st. petersburg calm countries , where the point of honor is better understood than among our hot headed parisians .: 572.63
<S> no light appeared through the chinks of the shutters ; no noise gave reason to believe that it was inhabited .: 76.78
<S> felton grew pale .: 62.05
<S> empty your pockets . there . right .: 336.28
<S> allow me to present you my sincere congratulations , replied madame de villefort .: 48.94
<S> god only knows .: 108.59
<S> the count advanced , smiling , into the centre of the room , and approached albert , who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner .: 40.88
<S> porthos was discontented with his condition .: 70.52
<S> noirtier looked the permission which she solicited .: 206.22
<S> indeed !: 31.25
<S> no .: 17.05
<S> come , i am a good sort of a prince , added he , and although i like not puritans i do them justice ; and it is the same with <UNK> , when they are pretty .: 73.69
<S> every one according to his nature , my dear d artagnan .: 36.70
<S> obey , said noirtier s intelligent eye .: 174.18
<S> have you seen him ? yes , sir . said mordaunt .: 13.13
<S> as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road , and i inquired where the asylum was ; the box confirmed my statement , the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents , the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else .: 149.05
<S> i mean , as i love .: 27.45
<S> ah , sir ! answered raoul , you joke about a real misfortune ; that is cruel , indeed . the good understanding between the two friends was not in the least altered by the morning s skirmish .: 77.71
<S> indeed , i should expect misfortunes . m .: 91.76
<S> on entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was maitre bernouin in person , who , standing on the threshold , awaited news of his vanished master .: 153.57
<S> at this moment the door of the minister s box opened , and madame danglars , accompanied by her daughter , entered , escorted by lucien debray , who assiduously conducted them to their seats .: 39.84
<S> the count of morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues .: 36.58
<S> porthos and aramis looked at each other , and grew pale .: 12.98
<S> dante s possessed a prodigious memory , combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of <UNK> ; the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him <UNK> at all kinds of calculation , while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical <UNK> , or the rigid severity of <UNK> .: 577.66
<S> i will enter a cloister ; i will become a nun , said milady .: 45.97
<S> in an instant , from the door of the cabinet to the street gate , the whole ho tel was boiling .: 42.45
<S> except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.f.3 , this work is provided to you as is , with no other warranties of any kind , express or implied , including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose .: 36.67
<S> meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required namely , a short carbine and a pair of double barrelled pistols , with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single barrelled one .: 241.62
<S> after ten minutes labor the wall gave way , and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened .: 132.66
<S> 25 the spahis are french cavalry reserved for service in africa .: 1523.86
<S> monte cristo was not deceived .: 17.03
<S> never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully .: 286.94
<S> the man came straight toward him .: 23.57
<S> here i await thee ! there was profound silence .: 83.58
<S> whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows , which you couldn t share without crime , you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain .: 252.28
<S> to whom ?: 84.50
<S> by me . what was his name ? lord winter . your uncle ? exclaimed cromwell .: 46.89
<S> bonacieux , with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable .: 35.91
<S> the latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances ; but porthos urged the commands of duty , and the procurator s wife was obliged to give place to the king .: 83.46
<S> she was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the prince de marsillac , the eldest son of the old duc de <UNK> , whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the duc de conde , her brother in law , whom she now hated mortally .: 101.35
<S> ah , is it you , dante s ? cried the man in the skiff .: 18.03
<S> valentine ? yes , yes , signed noirtier .: 37.84
<S> but go on , what about the club in the rue saint jacques ? why , they induced general quesnel to go there , and general quesnel , who quitted his own house at nine o clock in the evening , was found the next day in the seine . <UNK> and who told you this fine story ? the king himself . well , then , in return for your story , continued noirtier , i will tell you another . my dear father , i think i already know what you are about to tell me . ah , you have heard of the landing of the emperor ? not so loud , father , i entreat of you for your own sake as well as mine .: 45.51
<S> i had no doubt he would return the following night .: 28.44
<S> skirmishing .: 209.72
<S> i have but one word to add , and that is to propose an example to you not mine , for i myself have never appeared at court , and have only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer ; i speak of monsieur de tre ville , who was formerly my neighbor , and who had the honor to be , as a child , the play fellow of our king , louis xiii. , whom god preserve !: 67.44
<S> the queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude , whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mother s neck and kissed her her own eyes streaming with tears .: 70.15
<S> have you been long in the orangery ? he asked in a trembling voice , remembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury .: 63.09
<S> if i should be killed , one of you must take it , and continue the route ; if he be killed , it will be another s turn , and so on provided a single one arrives , that is all that is required . bravo , d artagnan , your opinion is mine , cried athos , besides , we must be consistent ; i am going to take the waters , you will accompany me .: 43.78
<S> that can be managed . i shall be baron ! explained porthos , stepping forward .: 117.23
<S> my dear fellow , are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box ? why , i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life ; but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might <UNK> my doing what you ask . at that instant , the countess perceived franz , and graciously waved her hand to him , to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head .: 64.92
<S> in the middle of the stream he stopped the boat , and <UNK> his burden over the water cried in a loud voice , let the justice of god be done ! and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters , which closed over it .: 61.74
<S> would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret ?: 132.08
<S> your ignorance on the subject , therefore , is easily accounted for .: 152.28
<S> do you remember , sir , that duel with the englishman in the inclosure des carmes ?: 93.71
<S> and grandpapa ? inquired the young girl , trembling with apprehension .: 30.02
<S> here is the passport , said the postilion , which way are we going , young gentleman ? to fontainebleau , replied euge nie with an almost masculine voice .: 75.79
<S> all four were to meet the next day at eleven o clock .: 22.17
<S> because , replied d artagnan , the queen desired every one to leave and i thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest . and you have been here since about a quarter of an hour , said d artagnan , motioning to porthos not to contradict him .: 35.53
<S> the bills signed by morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude , and , thanks to the delay granted by the englishman , were paid by cocles with equal punctuality .: 125.67
<S> oh , sir !: 8.42
<S> sometimes , but very rarely , my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace ; these were hours of recreation for me , as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selim s fiery lance .: 192.18
<S> aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder , and mousqueton another ball which lodged in the <UNK> part which <UNK> the lower portion of the loins .: 265.22
<S> shows how with threat and pen more is effected than by the sword .: 247.56
<S> to my grandfather s room . i in m. noirtier s apartment ? yes . can you mean it , valentine ? i have long wished it ; he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help , come . be careful , valentine , said morrel , hesitating to comply with the young girl s wishes ; i now see my error i acted like a madman in coming in here .: 85.05
<S> additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work .: 33.49
<S> i will try and gain a little sleep , for you are saved . go , said valentine , whatever happens , i promise you not to fear . monte cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl , who gradually fell asleep , yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given her .: 42.99
<S> no sooner said than done .: 241.29
<S> there , caressing as he pretended , the animal with his hand , he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear .: 104.26
<S> d artagnan passed to the head of the column , and leaving his friends under the guard of porthos , went straight to harrison , who recognized him as having met him at cromwell s and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition could .: 60.44
<S> we dress the king in groslow s clothes .: 108.15
<S> here i have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination , and furnished with thickly grown trees , beneath whose <UNK> screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will .: 535.27
<S> it was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people , generally , alone attended .: 156.44
<S> i would rather die on straw than <UNK> up a thousand a year by being governor of the bastile . he had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived .: 205.74
<S> advance , gentlemen , said the cardinal .: 17.20
<S> well , albert , said franz , do you feel much inclined to join the revels ?: 32.36
<S> will you tell me what you require , in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject ? in order to render an act valid , i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client .: 59.72
<S> yes , raoul , replied the count .: 9.67
<S> one seemed , as he raised the wine to his lips , to hear him say , come , <UNK> of the grape , and chase away my sorrows . and how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle !: 109.52
<S> you are a capital companion , d artagnan , said he ; your never failing cheerfulness <UNK> poor souls in affliction .: 230.63
<S> she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise ; but , strange to say , this portrait seemed to displease my father , and the value of the picture , which is , as you see , one of the best works of le opold robert , could not overcome his dislike to it .: 101.42
<S> they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis , and on their arrival made them acquainted with the situation .: 62.66
<S> are you not the soldier fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterloo ?: 87.81
<S> barrois asked , mademoiselle valentine ? noirtier nodded his head .: 173.88
<S> well , said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear not to be recognized , well !: 82.40
<S> if you go accompanied by any other person , or should anyone else go in your place , the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it . this postscript decreased greatly the young girl s happiness .: 98.44
<S> if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin , we do not understand each other . i don t say exactly , answered the gascon , confused .: 33.99
<S> every career is open to you .: 140.08
<S> i have done this , and am , monsieur , with great respect , your very humble and obedient servant , godeau , purveyor of the musketeers that s all well ! cried d artagnan .: 59.19
<S> a part of the good abbe s words , however , were wholly incomprehensible to him ; but , like the <UNK> which guides the navigator in northern latitudes , opened new <UNK> to the inquiring mind of the listener , and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons , enabling him justly to <UNK> the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth , where he was so much at home .: 435.36
<S> i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself .: 28.71
<S> the halt at noyon was but brief , every one there being wrapped in profound sleep .: 400.60
<S> not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor . that is my opinion , said aramis .: 52.06
<S> when they were gone , morrel ventured out from under the trees , and the moon shone upon his face , which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost .: 48.86
<S> the bolts were drawn ; the door groaned upon its hinges .: 40.98
<S> well , do you not adopt this means , athos ? said d artagnan .: 15.65
<S> as one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree , to the wing of a <UNK> , to the collar of a dog . and yet , me you see plainly that i love you . you say so . i am an honorable man . you say so . i am a gallant fellow . i believe it . i am brave . oh , i am sure of that ! then , put me to the proof . mme .: 50.38
<S> the house , with all its <UNK> antiquity and apparent misery , was yet cheerful and picturesque , and was the same that old dante s formerly inhabited the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret , while the whole house was now placed at the command of merce de s by the count .: 127.11
<S> ah ! he exclaimed , it is thou who <UNK> have him assassinated ?: 101.43
<S> he had scarcely done so before the door opened , and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed .: 26.63
<S> andrea , surrounded by his friends , complimented , flattered , beginning to believe in the reality of his dream , was almost bewildered .: 80.59
<S> it was therefore necessary , before everything else , and at all risks , that i should cause all traces of the past to disappear that i should destroy every material vestige ; too much reality would always remain in my recollection .: 151.73
<S> certainly certainly , cried franz .: 46.34
<S> they wished to carry him to the shore ; but when they touched him , although under jacopo s directions , he declared , with heavy groans , that he could not bear to be moved .: 58.49
<S> will the marquis honor me by a few moments private conversation ? ah , it is really a serious matter , then ? asked the marquis , remarking the cloud on villefort s brow .: 83.22
<S> a slight color mounted to his cheeks .: 72.74
<S> instead of a rude mixture of sailors , soldiers , and those belonging to the humblest <UNK> of life , the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society , magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper s reign ; officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with conde ; and younger members of families , brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr , and fifteen of restoration <UNK> to the rank of a god .: 283.40
<S> there is but one person , or rather , one cause , to whom a man like me can be useful that of the king . exactly , answered the musketeer .: 39.49
<S> the door was instantly opened and shut ; someone was taken in the mousetrap .: 65.21
<S> aramis shuddered .: 30.19
<S> the history of athos s imprisonment was then related to them ; and as they were really gentlemen , they pronounced the host in the wrong .: 59.79
<S> villefort and his wife both grew red , one from shame , the other from anger .: 180.27
<S> the moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light .: 109.62
<S> what the devil shall we do now , gentlemen ? cried athos .: 14.57
<S> but one morning at the commencement of the month of november everything was explained to him by this letter , dated from villeroy : m. d artagnan , mm .: 103.41
<S> d artagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding .: 53.06
<S> you know something about him , do you not , madame ?: 16.27
<S> but tell me , my dear sister , replied he , what makes you come to england ? i come to see you , replied milady , without knowing how much she <UNK> by this reply the suspicions to which d artagnan s letter had given birth in the mind of her brother in law , and only desiring to gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood .: 54.77
<S> i content myself with saying : command , monseigneur ; i am ready . your pardon ? said richelieu , surprised .: 59.96
<S> at five o clock the next morning she again proceeded , and in three hours after entered be thune .: 36.72
<S> well , how is it with this madman ? exclaimed he , turning round as the noise of the door announced the entrance of the host , who came in to inquire if he was unhurt .: 42.14
<S> it happened that on this particular night the minister s box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray , who offered it to the comte de morcerf , who again , upon his rejection of it by merce de s , sent it to danglars , with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening , in the event of their accepting the box in question .: 80.37
<S> well , what do you think of this , my fine fellow ? asked debray of the sergeant at arms , slipping a louis into his hand .: 35.29
<S> i have been here since the morning .: 17.24
<S> what the devil ! continued the king .: 12.04
<S> then the tunnel will be discovered ; the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry i uttered , will be questioned .: 82.20
<S> ho !: 16.63
<S> would you have given up the letter , aramis ? said d artagnan .: 17.71
<S> our house , added the englishman with a laugh , does not do things in that way . and you will pay ready money . <UNK> and the englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of bank notes , which might have been twice the sum m. de boville feared to lose .: 72.47
<S> they were , perhaps , in league with him . oh , sire , exclaimed the duc de blacas , m .: 34.96
<S> poor kitty hoped to speak a few words to d artagnan when he passed through her chamber ; but milady herself reconducted him through the darkness , and only quit him at the staircase .: 66.68
<S> the castle of bragelonne .: 48.14
<S> an astrologer predicted that ? said the duke , starting in spite of himself .: 83.71
<S> the evening of the betrothal villefort had , as we have said , hastened back to madame de saint me ran s in the place du grand cours , and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon .: 54.25
<S> signor pastrini , who had been accustomed to see them dine together , inquired into the cause of his absence , but franz merely replied that albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted .: 63.28
<S> he knew what were the rights of the great land owners .: 131.53
<S> to break my vow in behalf of the ex emperor . this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments .: 147.33
<S> no , albert , take my advice .: 25.34
<S> i shall see everything , and at the least suspicious sign i shall begin to exterminate . bravo ! thought d artagnan ; on this side i think the cardinal will be well guarded . he pressed the hand of the lord of pierrefonds and went in search of athos .: 63.38
<S> eleven o clock sounded .: 18.61
<S> still more , he has lifted the corner of her mask that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong .: 120.77
<S> dante s was then guilty , and now he is innocent , and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him . villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry , which , however improbable it might be , if it did take place would leave him defenceless .: 95.73
<S> for i had forgotten him , said the lieutenant .: 26.42
<S> i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba ? i do not know , sir ; it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere , who , when dying , gave me a packet for marshal <UNK> . then did you see him , edmond ? who ? the marshal . yes . morrel looked around him , and then , drawing dante s on one side , he said suddenly and how is the emperor ? very well , as far as i could judge from the sight of him . you saw the emperor , then ? he entered the marshal s apartment while i was there . and you spoke to him ? why , it was he who spoke to me , sir , said dante s , with a smile .: 43.88
<S> yes , she said , and you have still preserved this love in your heart one can only love once and did you ever see her again ? <UNK> never . never ? i never returned to the country where she lived . to malta ? yes ; malta . she is , then , now at malta ? i think so . and have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer ? her , yes . but only her ; do you then still hate those who separated you ? i hate them ?: 100.10
<S> then you love me ? said she .: 13.47
<S> though sinking from moment to moment , the wounded man was not yet dead .: 245.40
<S> monsieur d artagnan is not with me ; he serves under monsieur dessessart . well , then , take him , said the cardinal ; when four men are so much attached to one another , it is only fair that they should serve in the same company . that same evening m. de tre ville announced this good news to the three musketeers and d artagnan , inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning .: 49.62
<S> milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron will .: 307.84
<S> on his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army , mingling momentarily with the parisian troops , ran to him .: 180.87
<S> you ll bet for me and those gentlemen for monsieur groslow . by this arrangement d artagnan could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to athos and aramis .: 86.96
<S> andrea had spoken very little during dinner ; he was an intelligent lad , and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people , amongst whom , with dilating eyes , he saw the king s attorney .: 102.92
<S> but here are your bonds ; pay me differently ; and he held the bonds towards danglars , who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp .: 240.53
<S> on his account i add two hundred crowns . scoundrel ! muttered d artagnan .: 40.67
<S> we are all invited , my father , madame de villefort , and i at least , i understood it so . when will it be our turn to think of these things ?: 41.35
<S> at the sight of carlini , cucumetto rose , a pistol in each hand .: 41.02
<S> then he had eaten some without saying a word more ; danglars , therefore , concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti , who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland , and <UNK> sent from england , by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro , and the sterlet from the volga .: 239.87
<S> danglars stomach felt so empty , that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again ; still he had patience for another half hour , which appeared to him like a century .: 99.49
<S> scarcely had i finished my repast , when i felt myself sink by degrees into a strange torpor .: 129.16
<S> certainly , said d artagnan .: 9.03
<S> this time he had decided to relate all that had passed .: 29.52
<S> he had been subjected to a severe <UNK> course of medicine , at length he sent away all his doctors , declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment , and came to paris , where the fame of his wit had preceded him .: 142.28
<S> only , that there may be no delay , i shall borrow one of your horses . certainly ; all the four are at your service . oh , i need only one of them for the time being . shall we take our valets ? yes , you may as well take mousqueton .: 59.81
<S> richelieu was a gentleman , our equal in birth , our superior in position .: 196.98
<S> you know the proverb unlucky at play , lucky in love . you are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its revenge .: 175.27
<S> i am from the country . which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here <UNK> down our streets .: 212.17
<S> she must have spoken ; she must have confessed everything a woman is so weak !: 91.54
<S> yes , i. i think , sir , you exaggerate your situation , said madame danglars , whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment .: 42.62
<S> only take care that i am not seen through the wicket . oh , it is a proof that the lord is on our side , felton , replied milady .: 45.21
<S> he fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger , and perceived a man of from forty to forty five years of age , with black and piercing eyes , pale complexion , a strongly marked nose , and a black and well shaped mustache .: 53.65
<S> they looked for m. danglars , but , as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas , he had gone into the garden , and was talking with major cavalcanti on the projected railway from leghorn to florence .: 102.80
<S> it is well , sir , replied villefort from below , it is well ; have patience but one day longer ; what i have said i will do . noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words , and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side .: 57.03
<S> while i watched the window , he guarded the door . good ! said athos .: 53.38
<S> the valet de chambre appeared on the door steps .: 25.93
<S> thanks for those sweet words !: 169.64
<S> i can not comprehend what induced you to buy three ! therefore i only purchased two , said aramis .: 104.64
<S> and i , too , he exclaimed in a low voice , i unite with m. morrel in demanding justice for crime ; my blood <UNK> at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession . oh , merciful heavens ! murmured villefort .: 93.52
<S> i want to carry off my son from them , with yourself .: 66.90
<S> so that , thanks to her friend s generosity , teresa was the most beautiful and the best attired peasant near rome .: 131.23
<S> oh , sir , she stammered , i beseech you , do not believe appearances . are you , then , a coward ? cried villefort , in a contemptuous voice .: 24.24
<S> i heard it said that he was marching to the frontier to join the king . yes , madame ; but on the frontier he was met by <UNK> ; he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings .: 103.24
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> was felton , suspected by the baron , about to fail her at the decisive moment ?: 160.30
<S> can you be a coward , you , who have had the courage to witness the death of two old men and a young girl murdered by you ? sir !: 41.39
<S> to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org donate .: 47.00
<S> athos was the first to leave him , in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near blois ; porthos , the second , to marry an attorney s wife ; and lastly , aramis , the third , to take orders and become an abbe .: 71.88
<S> good news ! shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout .: 207.87
<S> in france people fight with the sword or pistol , in the colonies with the carbine , in arabia with the dagger .: 253.09
<S> the duke undid his belt and gave it to grimaud , who tied la ramee in such a way as to satisfy him .: 56.01
<S> dante s examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the <UNK> at marseilles as the works of the <UNK> in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels .: 160.64
<S> oh , i would advance ten millions on his signature .: 48.31
<S> oh , you will give me five minutes grace , replied morcerf , for i also expect a preserver . of whom ? of myself , cried morcerf ; parbleu ! do you think i can not be saved as well as anyone else , and that there are only arabs who cut off heads ?: 93.17
<S> why , my good fellow , you must be mad ! then , in a suppressed tone , as if speaking to himself , this is annoying , continued he .: 34.79
<S> madame , replied monte cristo , you must not ask of us , the <UNK> of fine porcelain , such a question .: 63.55
<S> there was no answer , and she continued : i have not seen you all day .: 20.85
<S> do you think it is to replace him on the throne that cromwell has paid for him two hundred thousand pounds <UNK> ?: 68.20
<S> he was a man between sixty six and sixty eight years of age , little , rather stout , with gray hair and light eyes .: 54.13
<S> are you disposed to obey count de rochefort ? i would follow him to hell , and that is saying not a little , as i believe him entirely capable of the descent . bravo ! by what sign to morrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes ? every frondist must put a knot of straw in his hat . good !: 113.07
<S> a small door , close to the lodge of the concierge , gave <UNK> and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot .: 101.22
<S> do not be alarmed , m. noirtier , said d avrigny ; i am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him ; this sort of attack is very frightful to witness . and taking barrois under the arms , he dragged him into an adjoining room ; but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade .: 50.63
<S> that is what i heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after i had entered it ; and that is why , on account of the living merce de s and my deceased father , i have sworn to revenge myself on fernand , and i have revenged myself . and you are sure the unhappy fernand did that ? i am satisfied , madame , that he did what i have told you ; besides , that is not much more odious than that a frenchman by <UNK> should pass over to the english ; that a spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards ; that a <UNK> of ali should have betrayed and murdered ali .: 82.63
<S> the prisoners are escaping ! cried the sergeant .: 29.38
<S> the very same .: 73.19
<S> the coadjutor has given me <UNK> from fasting on the jours <UNK> , on account of my health ; then i have engaged as my cook the cook who lived with <UNK> you know the man i mean ? the friend of the cardinal , and the famous epicure whose grace after dinner used to be , good lord , do me the favor to cause me to <UNK> what i have eaten . nevertheless he died of indigestion , in spite of his grace , said d artagnan .: 135.50
<S> i am sure of it they would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step .: 102.23
<S> what , no wine ?: 76.92
<S> so that , you see , there is a deadly <UNK> between us . but , said the envoy , you do not go about it in the right way to kill him , if i understand you correctly . <UNK> ? said the englishman , i practice shooting every day , and every other day grisier comes to my house . this was all the visitor wished to ascertain , or , rather , all the englishman appeared to know .: 90.43
<S> i took the precaution to half empty the carafe , in order that my suspicions might not be noticed .: 88.81
<S> yes , i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi s , and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men . for andrea rondolo ? asked franz .: 94.61
<S> to the champs e lyse es , said the general ; the count of monte cristo s .: 16.68
<S> do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg license terms from this work , or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg .: 17.42
<S> did i know poor dear edmond ?: 85.76
<S> don t you say , dear d artagnan , that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her ? i believe so , at least . in that case porthos will assist us . and how so , if you please ? why , by your marchioness , your duchess , your princess .: 37.61
<S> waiting for whom ? bertuccio , without answering , pointed to villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out <UNK> .: 470.05
<S> he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island ; he examined the stones , and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed , masked for precaution s sake .: 157.40
<S> i love you ; you permit me to tell you that i do that is already more happiness than i dared to hope . silence ! said mme .: 37.42
<S> he hoped , then , in a conversation with anne of austria , to obtain some information from that conversation , and afterward to come upon his eminence with some secret which the cardinal either knew or did not know , but which , in either case , would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister .: 75.16
<S> at the end of a long corridor , with which the door communicated , and which formed the antechamber , was , on the right , albert s breakfast room , looking into the court , and on the left the salon , looking into the garden .: 39.15
<S> i have had no occasion to notice him particularly ; he s an old acquaintance .: 69.25
<S> what for ? demanded porthos .: 29.13
<S> yes , said the major , i did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye . not on your own account , surely , replied monte cristo ; for a man is above that sort of thing ? oh , no , certainly not on my own account , said the major with a smile and a shake of the head .: 40.83
<S> but then you understand , madame coquenard , a mule with feathers and bells . be satisfied , said the procurator s wife .: 56.72
<S> instead of returning the ball to me when i call for it from the top of the wall , he throws me another ; that other ball contains a letter .: 89.33
<S> spaniards , englishmen , and italian <UNK> , adventurers of all nations , and soldiers of fortune of every <UNK> , <UNK> at the first summons under the standard of the protestants , and organized themselves like a vast association , whose branches diverged freely over all parts of europe .: 316.81
<S> well , what have you to say ?: 10.30
<S> the smugglers chapter 23 .: 47.37
<S> and yet the two young people had never declared their affection ; they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled , whose branches <UNK> , and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens .: 195.71
<S> do you know , count , that persons of our time of life not that you belong to the class , you are still a young man , but as i was saying , persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year .: 85.89
<S> as for the world , it is a sepulcher and nothing else . the devil !: 31.28
<S> m. de villefort pressed his hand upon his brow , which , at first pale , had become red and burning ; then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost his senses he wanted air .: 48.77
<S> if we had you , my friends !: 49.88
<S> the <UNK> of <UNK> it was evident that without suspecting it , and actuated solely by their <UNK> and adventurous character , our three friends had just rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special protection .: 337.00
<S> you are a brave fellow . as i told you , monsieur , replied planchet , <UNK> are found out by being used .: 54.15
<S> if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars , you would accuse me of intrigue , and would be <UNK> me , besides , i may not be there myself . where ? at your ball . why should you not be there ? because you have not yet invited me . but i come expressly for that purpose . you are very kind , but i may be prevented . if i tell you one thing , you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments . tell me what it is . my mother begs you to come . the comtesse de morcerf ? said monte cristo , starting .: 50.65
<S> meanwhile mousqueton continued on his way , and crossing the pont neuf , still driving the two sorry animals before him , he reached the rue aux ours .: 88.99
<S> are you prepared to embrace your worthy father ? i hope you do not doubt it . <UNK> go , then , into the drawing room , my young friend , where you will find your father awaiting you . andrea made a low bow to the count , and entered the adjoining room .: 38.25
<S> bravi !: 171.23
<S> they had just finished their double prayer , when a nun softly tapped at the door of the cell .: 82.22
<S> we can watch the skipper . and if he doesn t go straight i will crush him , that s all . well said , porthos , replied d artagnan .: 42.21
<S> nothing , replied the latter ; only , if the queen has the studs , which i very much doubt , count them , sire , and if you only find ten , ask her majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here . the king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him ; but he had not time to address any question to him a cry of admiration burst from every mouth .: 57.91
<S> there are yet five days left ; five days are more than i require .: 95.89
<S> he hastened to his cabinet .: 24.46
<S> and then , said aramis , <UNK> his ear to make it red , as he rubbed his hands to make them white , and then i made a certain rondeau upon it last year , which i showed to monsieur voiture , and that great man paid me a thousand compliments . a rondeau ! said the jesuit , disdainfully .: 93.28
<S> certainly , if milady s strength had been equal to her hatred , mme .: 54.38
<S> end of the port wine mystery .: 450.70
<S> wait , it ought to be there in my pocket ; it speaks of his return , does it not , porthos ? all gascon as he was , d artagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood .: 69.26
<S> bravo , d artagnan !: 15.12
<S> with 200 francs we can reach marseilles . with 200 francs ? are you sure , albert ? oh , as for that , i have made inquiries respecting the <UNK> and <UNK> , and my calculations are made .: 77.91
<S> in the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to monsieur de chavigny , whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him .: 64.62
<S> no entreaty , no proposition of increased wages , could induce them to remain ; to every argument they replied , we must go , for death is in this house . they all left , in spite of prayers and entreaties , <UNK> their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress , and especially mademoiselle valentine , so good , so kind , and so gentle .: 195.65
<S> porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations , only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully , and waved it to her as a sign of adieu .: 102.59
<S> oh , i am sure of it ; we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day .: 30.82
<S> sir , resumed the cardinal , you are to come with me , or rather , i am to go with you . i am at your command , my lord , returned d artagnan .: 11.48
<S> his fears were now no longer for his <UNK> , but for himself .: 80.63
<S> the cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the rochellais how unjust , selfish , and barbarous was the conduct of their leaders .: 234.88
<S> two or three <UNK> hung upon the ceiling , a table and two benches composed the entire furniture .: 122.37
<S> months and years rolled on .: 983.52
<S> now an englishman is an enemy ; this port wine belongs to the english , therefore it belongs to us . and our masters ? asked blaisois , stupefied by this <UNK> , delivered with an air of profound sagacity , will they be of your opinion ? mousqueton smiled disdainfully .: 99.96
<S> well , said beauchamp , what still oppresses you , my friend ? <UNK> i am broken hearted , said albert .: 90.90
<S> felton recognized it also , and made a step toward the door .: 27.46
<S> the most important thing was , not to kill him only for i had an opportunity of doing so a hundred times but to kill him without being discovered at least , without being arrested .: 55.47
<S> you will be served , thus , madame , three times a day , said he .: 41.64
<S> yes , during the spanish war , at perpignan , where fernand had left her ; she was attending to the education of her son . the abbe started .: 64.52
<S> the carnival at rome when franz recovered his senses , he saw albert drinking a glass of water , of which , to judge from his pallor , he stood in great need ; and the count , who was assuming his masquerade costume .: 100.25
<S> ah , count , she exclaimed , with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the rue meslay .: 101.79
<S> tis a matter of conscience with them , as with us . meantime , here we are , enemies ! said porthos .: 60.16
<S> this affair made a great noise .: 41.86
<S> one of the forty methods of escape of the duc de beaufort .: 43.62
<S> are you satisfied now ? inquired valentine .: 17.56
<S> to the swords !: 78.11
<S> we must go and find lord winter . they both set off to the other end of the camp , but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for .: 52.99
<S> the two men in black rose , bowed to aramis and d artagnan , and advanced toward the door .: 22.15
<S> here , replied the gendarmes .: 32.73
<S> hayde e , still calm , but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been , handed to the president the record of her sale , written in arabic .: 131.52
<S> why , then , doesn t he attend to it himself , as at chantilly ? ah , monsieur , i have not here , as i had there , the ponds of monsieur le prince , where i could catch those beautiful carp , nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges .: 93.82
<S> dear maximilian , interrupted the count , listen how <UNK> duprez is singing that line , o <UNK> !: 468.82
<S> i must and will see him again .: 33.16
<S> the interview for which i ask is of us two alone , and i very earnestly wish that it may not be interrupted . i am not at home to any one , said the duchess de chevreuse to the footman .: 68.02
<S> since the first attack i experienced of this malady , i have continually reflected on it .: 93.36
<S> look out ! cried d artagnan , i see black points and red points moving yonder .: 249.18
<S> you have brought me something ? yes , if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief . here it is , said aramis , taking a small key from his breast and opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl , here it is .: 68.05
<S> although the musketeer was not expected before one o clock , the procurator s wife had been on the watch ever since midday , reckoning that the heart , or perhaps the stomach , of her lover would bring him before his time .: 77.22
<S> he was about to marry her , when one of the caprices of fate , which would almost make us doubt the goodness of providence , if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by proving that all is but a means of conducting to an end , one of those caprices deprived him of his mistress , of the future of which he had dreamed for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present , and cast him into a dungeon . ah , said morrel , one quits a dungeon in a week , a month , or a year . he remained there fourteen years , morrel , said the count , placing his hand on the young man s shoulder .: 71.49
<S> he waited ten minutes , a quarter of an hour , half an hour , no change took place .: 25.09
<S> he buried his brow in his hands and thought of the world , so beautiful when one is about to leave it ; of the caresses of children , so pleasing and so sweet , especially when one is parting from his children never to see them again ; then of his wife , the noble and courageous woman who had sustained him to the last moment .: 78.91
<S> gentlemen , said the president , when silence was restored , is the count of morcerf convicted of <UNK> , treason , and conduct <UNK> a member of this house ? yes , replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice .: 86.82
<S> the letters being finished , each put his own into two envelopes , so that no one , without tearing the first envelope , could discover to whom the second was addressed ; then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters .: 143.02
<S> you would not have me marry under such sad auspices ? my child , exclaimed the old lady sharply , let us hear none of the conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the future .: 229.88
<S> we have promised and we will keep our promise .: 42.91
<S> my father said i was his joy you style me your love , and both of you have called me my child . do you remember your father , hayde e ? the young greek smiled .: 73.90
<S> how old is she ? inquired the vicomte de bragelonne .: 31.58
<S> well , monsieur laporte placed her near her majesty in order that our poor queen might at least have someone in whom she could place confidence , abandoned as she is by the king , watched as she is by the cardinal , betrayed as she is by everybody . ah , ah !: 84.68
<S> thrust it into my mouth , my lord , thrust it in . grimaud prepared to comply with this request , when the officer made a sign as if he had something to say .: 58.22
<S> god forbid ! then let us be as we used to be ; let us be open with each other .: 49.82
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> this news , false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred , evidently astonished the auditors , and they retired without a word .: 167.98
<S> the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franz s curiosity .: 210.42
<S> general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg electronic works 1.a .: 19.61
<S> yet you have need , i believe , to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken ; for , if i mistake not , you came to paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune . i am at the age of extravagant hopes , monseigneur , said d artagnan .: 57.68
<S> bravo !: 16.42
<S> i have more than once intended witnessing an execution , but i have never been able to make up my mind ; and you , albert ? i , replied the viscount , i saw <UNK> executed , but i think i was rather intoxicated that day , for i had quitted college the same morning , and we had passed the previous night at a tavern . besides , it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris , that you should not see one anywhere else ; when you travel , it is to see everything .: 61.54
<S> what a strange fellow you are , said the jeweller , taking the diamond from his hand .: 18.47
<S> milady does not know me ; i will get access to her without her suspecting me , and when i catch my beauty , i will strangle her . well , replied athos , i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur porthos . for shame ! said aramis .: 56.62
<S> sir , began raoul , with his usual politeness , are you an ecclesiastic ? why do you ask me that ? replied the stranger , with a coolness which was barely civil .: 57.05
<S> but he is mistaken ; i shall not leave so near the queen that source of <UNK> with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point . anne blushed and buried her face in her hands .: 155.17
<S> he remained motionless on the spot , pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat .: 47.19
<S> my idea ? said d artagnan .: 18.75
<S> he took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom .: 54.73
<S> on arriving there , with an air as majestic as that of an emperor , he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow .: 59.64
<S> villefort , maddened with horror , stepped back to the <UNK> of the door , fixing his eyes on the corpse .: 50.55
<S> this time franz could contain himself no longer , but sank , half fainting , into a seat .: 57.06
<S> return to paris , said he ; assemble the servants who remain there .: 59.51
<S> aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs , and then immediately came up again to d artagnan , whose senses were still in a state of confusion .: 31.04
<S> i was not deceived , said he ; here is monsieur d artagnan ; and you are his friends , messieurs athos , porthos , and aramis . the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment .: 32.89
<S> as for me , i had been forgotten in the general confusion ; i ran toward ali tepelini ; he saw me hold out my arms to him , and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips .: 48.60
<S> he must have written to him .: 24.92
<S> no objection was raised , and the infant was given up to her .: 59.47
<S> the beautiful catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile , because she saw nothing but misery around her ; the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical <UNK> choose as not likely to show the dirt ; the floor was <UNK> ; the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury ; indeed , everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and elegance .: 364.08
<S> the foundation s ein or federal tax identification number is 64 6221541 .: 19.40
<S> why have we not a grimaud near every prince ? patience ! replied mazarin , with his italian smile ; that may happen one day ; but in the meantime well , in the meantime ? i shall still take precautions . and he wrote to d artagnan to hasten his return .: 76.35
<S> he entered , after having twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial , which always announced on his part the most triumphant resolutions .: 197.90
<S> mousqueton , at the head of them , wiped his eyes .: 36.19
<S> remain here ?: 110.45
<S> we shall be absent at least a week , said the patron , and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again . why , said dante s , if in two or three days you hail any fishing boat , desire them to come here to me .: 61.29
<S> well , asked the count in arabic , have you been to see the old man ? ali made a sign in the affirmative .: 23.22
<S> sir , said he , i am chief clerk of the house of thomson french , of rome .: 21.77
<S> monsieur de beaufort or another .: 73.83
<S> my god , i am lost ! felton remained standing , motionless and undecided .: 22.91
<S> the horses , excited by pain and emulation , <UNK> over the dark road , in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass , <UNK> and more obscure than the rest of the horizon .: 78.10
<S> a frondeur !: 108.45
<S> beware ! said i , for my liberty is your dishonor . explain yourself , my pretty <UNK> ! yes ; for as soon as i leave this place i will tell everything .: 62.63
<S> at a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on lens , at bay , and before lens the enemy s entire army .: 101.49
<S> d artagnan , of the king s guards , company dessessart , is expected at the palais cardinal this evening , at eight o clock .: 37.75
<S> then the postscript well ; what of the postscript ? then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter ? certainly ; the abbe busoni and myself have a small account open between us .: 141.77
<S> oh , tomorrow , tomorrow , i must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me ; and that you may not forget me , take this ! and she slipped a ring from her finger onto d artagnan s .: 64.06
<S> i have , however , a wish to go and pass a day at blois .: 29.32
<S> he could not yet see that dreadful cross , but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet him .: 64.60
<S> and wherefore fire ? said the colonel ; every one has yielded . it is the son of milady , said athos to d artagnan .: 48.25
<S> and how he terrified them , even then , and made them fly before him !: 136.26
<S> in a word , an almost poetical fervor prevailed .: 82.90
<S> it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of another .: 100.71
<S> besides , this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner .: 88.22
<S> andrea was short and fat ; his visage , marked with brutal cruelty , did not indicate age ; he might be thirty .: 202.61
<S> from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simple a cabbage , for instance .: 286.36
<S> no , it had just struck four .: 51.69
<S> you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service ; and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services , that upon edmond s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dante s and myself each to resume our respective posts . thanks , danglars that will smooth over all difficulties .: 159.12
<S> no one has brought a letter , monsieur , replied planchet ; but one has come of itself . what do you mean , blockhead ? i mean to say that when i came in , although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket , and that key had never quit me , i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom . and where is that letter ? i left it where i found it , monsieur .: 43.97
<S> with your lasso you could stop an ox ? again ali repeated his affirmative gesture .: 390.16
<S> i have not said adieu to him ! a noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved upon the block .: 97.44
<S> when the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa , tapping his boot with the gold headed cane which he held in his hand .: 44.17
<S> he went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty .: 164.51
<S> in france ! he cried , the usurper in france !: 51.06
<S> the king went away enchanted .: 83.07
<S> no doubt , said aramis , but it is far from here to the enemy . sir , the distance will be diminished , said a subordinate .: 53.72
<S> i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches .: 104.33
<S> you will assist me in the work , will you not ? most undoubtedly .: 35.87
<S> his hands , of which he took little care , were the despair of aramis , who cultivated his with <UNK> paste and perfumed oil .: 155.55
<S> i now understand why you are in the service of cromwell ; you hate the king . yes , my lord , i hate him ! said the young man .: 24.79
<S> i give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave him . this reassures me more than all the royal signatures , thought d artagnan .: 42.12
<S> the two ladies entered the drawing room with that sort of official stiffness which <UNK> a formal communication .: 160.85
<S> i can manage your business for you .: 36.91
<S> i hope , madame , that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men ! ah !: 37.18
<S> the terrible moment had come , but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least .: 38.77
<S> the cardinal is not the man to forget a <UNK> until he has settled account with the <UNK> ; and the <UNK> appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance . do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself , and knows that i have been to london ? the devil !: 77.25
<S> cromwell is stout and short , and this man thin and lanky , rather tall than otherwise . some condemned soldier , perhaps , suggested athos , whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide . no , no , continued d artagnan , it was not the measured step of a foot soldier , nor was it the gait of a horseman .: 146.51
<S> i don t need the quarter of such a sum i who am still only in the guards and by selling my saddles , i shall procure it .: 81.54
<S> you have decidedly some genius at your control . ma foi , spread that idea , replied the count of monte cristo , putting his foot on the velvet lined steps of his splendid carriage , and that will be worth something to me among the ladies . as he spoke , he sprang into the vehicle , the door was closed , but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf .: 61.39
<S> five minutes after the door had been closed on morrel s entrance , it was again opened for the count .: 30.03
<S> danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf , when someone came and whispered a few words to him .: 67.92
<S> is that your opinion , d herblay ? yes , said aramis , we have promised . then , continued athos , we have another reason ; it is this listen : in france at this moment everything is poor and paltry .: 50.06
<S> athos and aramis followed him .: 9.84
<S> it appears to me that if my boots need a sponge , your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a brush .: 242.75

<S> his reflections were not very cheerful .: 58.65
<S> before felton replied , and before she should be forced to resume this conversation , so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone , she let her hands fall ; and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic , she said : but no , it is not for me to be the judith to deliver <UNK> from this <UNK> .: 109.92
<S> one of them preceded the rest by double the length of his horse .: 90.13
<S> i know the world is a drawing room , from which we must retire politely and honestly ; that is , with a bow , and our debts of honor paid . that is to the purpose .: 84.80
<S> in our position , one must provide for everything , i shall try to gain the coast of france .: 61.14
<S> i know it is a weakness , said caderousse , but it <UNK> me . and yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick . come , said caderousse , wiping his large knife on his apron , if i did not like you , do you think i should endure the wretched life you lead me ?: 60.14

<S> to lose a year , two years , three years , is to talk of an eternity ; to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal , perhaps ; to return when d artagnan and his friends , happy and triumphant , should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her these were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure .: 116.23

<S> i go , he said , only , shall i enter the chamber where those gentlemen are ? no , it is not worth while . well , do me the kindness to take my purse , which i left on the mantelpiece . all right . he then proceeded , with his usual calm gait , to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery , who , foreigner as he was , could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs .: 65.45

<S> the pont du gard inn such of my readers as have made a <UNK> excursion to the south of france may perchance have noticed , about midway between the town of beaucaire and the village of bellegarde , a little nearer to the former than to the latter , a small roadside inn , from the front of which hung , creaking and <UNK> in the wind , a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the pont du gard .: 189.16

<S> now the mischief is out ; depend upon it the custom house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence , and discovered poor dante s hidden treasures . merce de s , however , paid no heed to this explanation of her lover s arrest .: 164.47
<S> don t you think so , d artagnan ? i think so , indeed , cried he .: 16.13
<S> or , rather , who pretend not to understand me , sir ! replied the prisoner , with a smile of incredulity .: 35.83

<S> i swear it before heaven . and the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward .: 104.59
<S> some minutes after , the superior of the convent sent to inform the musketeers that the burial would take place at midday .: 64.58
<S> you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying , sir , have you ? asked the notary .: 42.00

<S> the next minute franz heard himself called by albert , who made the lofty building re echo with the sound of his friend s name .: 120.75
<S> but my wife wants a gold chain , and i want a pair of silver buckles . the jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box , which contained several <UNK> of the articles demanded .: 119.14
<S> yes , you are at once from provence and spain ; that explains , if the portrait you showed me be like , the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan . it would have required the penetration of <UNK> or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words , apparently uttered with the greatest politeness .: 173.75
<S> he tore the dress of the countess to pieces ; he tied her hands behind her , and hanged her on a tree . heavens , athos , a murder ? cried d artagnan .: 51.35

<S> you had never anything to complain of ? said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abbe .: 54.59
<S> as to hayde e , these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment , for she ceased speaking , her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm ; and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina , which , like a magic mirror , seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched .: 126.35
<S> the popular banker found that it answered better than count .: 410.90
<S> what do you think of it , my little fellow ? said caderousse .: 9.51
<S> i think some one is coming . mousqueton made , with a low whistling sound , the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth , resumed his place at the table and made a sign to blaisois to follow his example .: 73.64
<S> mouston , cried porthos .: 46.44
<S> if you see him coming on one side of the street , pass by on the other .: 38.22
<S> but what could these men , whom i at first took for robbers , want with me , and why is monsieur bonacieux not here ? madame , those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been , for they are the agents of the cardinal ; and as to your husband , monsieur bonacieux , he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the bastille . my husband in the bastille ! cried mme .: 79.13
<S> two hours passed thus ; madame de saint me ran was in a feverish sleep , and the notary had arrived .: 26.55
<S> the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man , if those clothes had not been torn to shreds ; still they did not show signs of wear , and the fine cloth , beneath the careful hands of the prisoner , soon recovered its <UNK> in the parts which were still perfect , for the <UNK> tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat .: 162.19
<S> what could explain athos s having re entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table ?: 250.44
<S> my dear fellow , it is perfectly ridiculous stupid !: 52.77
<S> the host insisted ; but the travelers were firm , and he was obliged to do as they wished .: 42.94
<S> their agony formed part of their merit if they were not seen alive , they were despised when dead . yes , said debray , but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome . true , said monte cristo ; but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus , if we can do no better than he could ? the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes , but had the good sense not to say anything .: 90.57
<S> the vendomois road , he replied .: 139.00
<S> we are not living in the time of cardinal richelieu , who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion . it matters not ; you were wrong to reply to him as you did , continued aramis , following with his eyes the young man , now vanishing behind the <UNK> .: 89.14
<S> as a result she raised her head , opened her eyes , and sighed deeply .: 30.91
<S> i have , therefore , received a very good education , and have been treated by these <UNK> very much as the slaves were treated in <UNK> minor , whose masters made them <UNK> , doctors , and philosophers , in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market . monte cristo smiled with satisfaction ; it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m. andrea cavalcanti .: 122.31
<S> there is no god ; there is no providence all comes by chance . there is a providence ; there is a god , said monte cristo , of whom you are a striking proof , as you lie in utter despair , denying him , while i stand before you , rich , happy , safe and entreating that god in whom you endeavor not to believe , while in your heart you still believe in him . but who are you , then ? asked caderousse , fixing his dying eyes on the count .: 76.35
<S> she asked me not to send the protestants of la rochelle the assistance i promised them ; i have not done so .: 97.48
<S> you will bring lights , and relieve the sentinel , continued felton .: 99.10
<S> matters go but badly , said athos , smiling ; and we shall not be made <UNK> of the order this time . wait here ten minutes , said m. de tre ville ; and if at the expiration of ten minutes you do not see me come out , return to my ho tel , for it will be useless for you to wait for me longer . the four young men waited ten minutes , a quarter of an hour , twenty minutes ; and seeing that m. de tre ville did not return , went away very uneasy as to what was going to happen .: 36.09
<S> they both advanced beneath the trees , through whose branches streamed the moonlight .: 142.77
<S> the soldiers interposed their bayonets , for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector , and the latter recoiled two or three steps .: 64.77
<S> ho !: 16.63
<S> d artagnan , who never turned his head , did not perceive it .: 22.08
<S> decidedly , aramis , said athos , i think i was wrong not to let you fire . hold your tongue , replied aramis ; you would make me weep , if such a thing were possible . at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men , servants and baggage were aboard .: 58.59
<S> another blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to the ground , covered with blood and almost fainting .: 56.16

<S> i shall call you presently . patrick went out .: 60.80
<S> it is fair to assume that dante s was on board a smuggler .: 65.13
<S> well , my friend , nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow . hush ! said athos , putting a finger on his lips , with the sad smile peculiar to him ; let us talk no more of mordaunt it will bring bad luck . and athos set forward toward charenton , followed closely by aramis .: 75.72
<S> just as he was passing the count s box , the door opened , and monte cristo came forth .: 25.53
<S> but so it is ; a woman will often , from mere wilfulness , prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe .: 163.87
<S> doubtless , my dear viscount , you will not be taken by force ; and seriously , do you wish to break off your engagement ? i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so . then make yourself quite easy .: 34.89
<S> i know how clear sighted your dreams are ; i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt , and i gained 400,000 francs by it , of which 100,000 have been honestly paid to you .: 247.40
<S> m. de villefort passed on to his own room .: 16.43
<S> the king smiled , patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle .: 40.10
<S> just assume the tone and manner of a husband , and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come ! the bride blushed , while fernand , restless and uneasy , seemed to start at every fresh sound , and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow .: 96.94
<S> the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows , and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbe s ladder of <UNK> .: 87.22
<S> villefort fully understood his father s meaning , and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders .: 87.63
<S> he had instructed porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony ; and porthos , in full dress , mounted his finest horse , taking the part of supernumerary musketeer , as d artagnan had so often done formerly .: 104.50
<S> he is writing , she said .: 30.75
<S> bravo , bravo ! morrel saw it was useless to say more , and refrained .: 58.15
<S> i regret now , said he , having helped you in your late inquiries , or having given you the information i did . why so ? inquired dante s .: 50.03
<S> the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of franz s former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features ; for the countess , after gazing with a puzzled look at his face , burst into a fit of laughter , and begged to know what had happened .: 102.29
<S> well , your publisher is very generous , my dear aramis , that s all i can say . how , monsieur ? cried bazin , a poem sell so dear as that !: 61.77
<S> are you going to leave us , count ? said madame de villefort .: 9.15
<S> d artagnan went from captain groslow to colonel harrison and from colonel harrison to his friends .: 157.38
<S> i was a witness of the last hours of charles i .: 80.41

<S> at last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the <UNK> king .: 83.85
<S> when he had finished , he said : my mistress said she should expect you , sir , as soon as you had finished dressing . i am going to her . and villefort , with his papers under his arm and hat in hand , directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife .: 46.33
<S> felton remained behind ; he held a book in his hand .: 27.96
<S> but after all , asked porthos , who is milady ? a charming woman ! said athos , sipping a glass of sparkling wine .: 55.62
<S> i am not so much at liberty as you suppose ; on the contrary , i have a most important engagement . ah , take care , you were teaching me just now how , in case of an invitation to dinner , one might <UNK> make an excuse .: 69.42
<S> when my father conspired , it was not for the emperor , it was against the bourbons ; for m. noirtier possessed this peculiarity , he never projected any <UNK> schemes which could never be realized , but strove for possibilities , and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain , theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result . well , said monte cristo , it is just as i thought ; it was politics which brought noirtier and m. d e pinay into personal contact .: 191.98
<S> it was the first time franz had ever seen a guillotine , we say guillotine , because the roman mandai a is formed on almost the same model as the french <UNK> the knife , which is shaped like a <UNK> , that cuts with the <UNK> side , falls from a less height , and that is all the difference .: 217.60
<S> there still remains that of bernajoux , but you must not be too confident . as to the rest , m. de tre ville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over , for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door after him , than his eminence said to the king , now that we are at length by ourselves , we will , if your majesty pleases , converse seriously .: 62.69
<S> by notre dame !: 66.91
<S> speak loud , very loud , for they will be listening at the door .: 43.55
<S> what a disgrace to us . oh , never fear !: 99.08
<S> d artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms .: 28.93
<S> i am sure he will look like the great <UNK> ! they made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses .: 91.47
<S> as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten , he was told that lord wilmore , who was precision and punctuality personified , was not yet come in , but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck .: 81.04
<S> d artagnan looked with surprise at his friend .: 15.62
<S> you hailed me , i think ? danglars retreated a step or two .: 90.83
<S> my dear monsieur de rochefort , how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal !: 45.17
<S> no , sir , the facts were precisely what you have stated , said madame de villefort ; and it was to prevent the <UNK> of old <UNK> that m. de villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies . it was a sublime and charitable thought , said monte cristo , and the whole world should applaud it .: 94.66
<S> when he came within hearing , he exclaimed : i am pursued ; can you conceal me ? they knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit ; but there is an <UNK> sympathy between the roman brigand and the roman peasant and the latter is always ready to aid the former .: 141.18
<S> on the landing they were no longer fighting , but amused themselves with stories about women , and in the antechamber , with stories about the court .: 79.45
<S> the duc d orle ans visited the posts .: 543.09
<S> you , m. de villefort , send for the priest ; i will be the avenger . what do you mean , sir ? asked villefort , trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of morrel .: 29.04
<S> the hundred days m. noirtier was a true prophet , and things <UNK> rapidly , as he had predicted .: 215.29
<S> this path was formed in the shape of the figure of 8 , thus , in its windings , making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty .: 103.32
<S> pardieu ! said villefort , he is a noble fellow .: 17.48
<S> well , porthos , follow my examples ; walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea .: 228.28
<S> do you wish to destroy me ? you see very plainly that there is still danger for you , since a single word makes you tremble ; and you confess that if that word were heard you would be ruined .: 61.80
<S> master broussel is being strangled . it was friquet s voice ; and dame nanette , feeling herself supported , recommenced with all her strength to sound her <UNK> <UNK> .: 441.91
<S> well , then , a good journey to you , said caderousse .: 14.38
<S> at six o clock villefort retired to his study , at eight m. d avrigny himself arrived , bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl , and then m. noirtier was carried away .: 62.66
<S> he had at once declared for a military life , and had in consequence studied hard , passed brilliantly through the polytechnic school , and left it as sub lieutenant of the <UNK> of the line .: 222.94
<S> villefort violently <UNK> his greatcoat , which seemed to strangle him , and passing his livid hand across his forehead , entered his study .: 89.60
<S> i am lost ! said d artagnan to himself .: 6.21
<S> that is why valentine passed through her room , which was on a level with valentine s , and only separated from it by edward s .: 81.32
<S> a rondeau ! said the curate , mechanically .: 46.50
<S> mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that d artagnan had seen and heard everything ; but he was pleased with his falsehood .: 48.08
<S> and he conducted them to mousqueton , who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis apiece .: 134.98
<S> this army is commanded by a butcher , or the son of a butcher it matters little colonel harrison .: 250.13
<S> once more , let me thank you , my good friends , both in my own name and the queen s. the three gentlemen then shook hands , lord de winter taking the rue saint honore , and athos and aramis remaining together .: 58.86
<S> he brought it to bear , skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning , and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible .: 138.70
<S> and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love , and that i believed that woman dead ? asked d artagnan .: 22.45
<S> athos ! cried aramis , with an emotion very rare in him .: 39.64
<S> three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic ; these were villefort , valentine , and the old servant of whom we have already spoken .: 79.07
<S> d artagnan went to the window with his habitual composure .: 17.25
<S> aramis , not liking to soil his boots with this artificial <UNK> , <UNK> them rather sharply .: 814.76
<S> your brother in law is a <UNK> ?: 69.37
<S> imagine my surprise , when , upon returning home , the first object i met on the staircase was the <UNK> jockey in the pink jacket !: 278.35
<S> a million ?: 86.67
<S> grimaud , meantime , undid the means of escape .: 54.96
<S> and having got out all he wanted , he paid for the <UNK> , which he did not drink , and went quickly back to the rue tiquetonne .: 50.53
<S> monsieur de chavigny , who at heart detested the cardinal , took pains to tell the story to two or three friends , who put it into immediate circulation .: 92.39
<S> you will be a brave and adventurous captain . d artagnan , his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy , went back to athos , whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of his last glass of malaga by the light of his lamp .: 94.33
<S> tell me his name , and i will put it in the place of the name of charlotte backson .: 29.88
<S> morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear valentine say , here i am , maximilian ; come and help me . he had arranged everything for her escape ; two ladders were hidden in the clover field ; a cabriolet was ordered for maximilian alone , without a servant , without lights ; at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps , as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions .: 142.73
<S> milady was not deceived .: 22.53
<S> but , asked morrel , will the house of thomson french consent ? oh , i take everything on myself .: 57.18
<S> three things were especially urged upon the officers , who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously : the first , that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its <UNK> ; the second , to go to the charge no faster than a walk ; the third , to let the enemy fire first .: 209.46
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> oh , pardon me , pardon me ! cried she , sinking upon the shoulders of milady .: 17.58
<S> come , athos and aramis , go to the right ; porthos , come with me to the left ; these gentlemen should file off into normandy , whilst we , by the nearest road , reach paris . he then gave his friends minute directions as to their route .: 106.91
<S> besides , do you know what is our situation , and whether mazarin s arrest wouldn t be rather an <UNK> than an advantage ? say at once you disapprove of my proposal . i think you ought to do nothing , since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let mazarin know that we were in france . i have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free .: 128.87
<S> oh , yes , tired enough he has done nothing the whole of this blessed day !: 79.62
<S> he rose , however , as they approached .: 20.45
<S> we have a precious fellow here ! monsieur grimaud ! said the duke , for your sake i beg of you , never come within the reach of my fist ! hush !: 51.13
<S> my friend , who was seigneur of the country , might have seduced her , or taken her by force , at his will for he was master .: 74.85
<S> and you , grimaud , he said to his companion , who had just come in after his round with d artagnan , are you thirsty ? as thirsty as a scotchman ! was grimaud s laconic reply .: 81.36
<S> no , only add two bottles of champagne , and the difference will be for the napkins . the host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for , but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of anjou wine instead of two bottles of champagne .: 124.50
<S> two of the men from jacopo s boat came on board the yacht to assist in <UNK> it , and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles .: 127.46
<S> that would be too terrible ! calm yourself , sir , replied de guiche .: 32.33
<S> do you wish for a name ?: 19.29
<S> is he a shepherd or a nobleman ? young or old ? tall or short ?: 203.18
<S> morrel does not know my name ; this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome , with whom your father does business . the young girl turned pale and continued to descend , while the stranger and cocles continued to mount the staircase .: 57.04
<S> it was a good augury .: 28.28
<S> this is what was done .: 20.26
<S> give your orders . have you kitchens here ? kitchens ? of course complete ones . and cooks ? excellent ! well , a fowl , fish , game , it signifies little , so that i eat . as your excellency pleases .: 271.17
<S> the soldiers , whom he was nearly trampling , ran away .: 63.98
<S> the young girl was very pensive , but seeing luigi so cheerful , she on her part assumed a smiling air , which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion .: 68.44
<S> be ready , said porthos , as he slipped through the opening .: 31.43
<S> the boat they were in could not make a long voyage ; there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor ; he thought , perhaps , they were going to leave him on some distant point .: 76.52
<S> in the evening , at the appointed hour , the four friends met .: 15.04
<S> as to d artagnan , he sprang toward jussac himself .: 32.15
<S> his apartment consisted of two small chambers , very nicely fitted up , in a furnished house , the hostess of which , still young and still really handsome , cast tender glances uselessly at him .: 221.51
<S> m. noirtier has evinced , you say , a kind feeling towards me .: 100.22
<S> you will live , my lord , you will live ! repeated the faithful servant of anne of austria , on his knees before the duke s sofa .: 31.02
<S> ah , that s true ! said athos .: 7.36
<S> then , said the two women to emmanuel , we are indeed ruined . it was agreed in a brief council held among them , that julie should write to her brother , who was in garrison at ni mes , to come to them as <UNK> as possible .: 98.51
<S> i really never heard a person speak as you do . because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions , and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper <UNK> which god has peopled with invisible or <UNK> beings . and you allow then , sir , that <UNK> exist , and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us ? why should they not ?: 288.00
<S> pistache went again around the circle , but stopped at no one , and at last went to the door and began to scratch and bark .: 100.60
<S> i will keep twenty to hold in check the mob ; go , and lose not a moment .: 96.88
<S> reflect , then , wretched man , and repent . no , said caderousse , no ; i will not repent .: 48.45
<S> although he was a perfect stranger in the court of m. de tre ville s courtiers , and this his first appearance in that place , he was at length noticed , and somebody came and asked him what he wanted .: 50.13
<S> well , albert , this money , which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored , may now , through strange and painful circumstances , be devoted to the same purpose .: 165.22
<S> at length an old , worm eaten shutter was opened , or rather pushed ajar , but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric , sword belt , and pistol <UNK> of d artagnan .: 185.74
<S> the squares were broken to shivers ; and athos , like the spectre of vengeance , leaped into the room .: 79.08
<S> be so good as to mention this name to his eminence and to bring me word whether he will receive me yes or no . saying which , he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to puritans .: 161.91
<S> well , sir , said the queen , what is your opinion of this riot ? that it is no longer a riot , madame , he replied , but a revolt . the revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel , cried anne , unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor , whom she looked upon , and probably with reason , as the <UNK> of the tumult .: 68.96
<S> and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do ; perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile . madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening , replied the husband , seriously ; she is detained at the louvre this evening by her duties . so much the worse for you , my dear host , so much the worse !: 55.49
<S> pressing his lips close to the planks , he exclaimed : don t be alarmed , valentine it is i ! again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate , saying , as she did so : and why do you come so late today ?: 81.44
<S> i placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men ; i encircled the castle ; the riding horses i entrusted to grimaud and i awaited your coming out , which i did not expect till to morrow , and i didn t hope to free you without a skirmish .: 120.83
<S> we fear so , and our only regret is to die so far from both of you . what will you do in a foreign land , an enemy s country ? i traveled in england when i was young , i speak english like an englishman , and aramis , too , knows something of the language .: 88.13
<S> when her hands were <UNK> he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her face .: 216.71
<S> and you , my lord ? if i wish to leave ? that would be much more difficult . why so ? your eminence might be recognized . even under this disguise ? asked mazarin , raising a cloak which covered an arm chair , upon which lay a complete dress for an officer , of pearl gray and red , entirely embroidered with silver .: 69.45
<S> we shall try to persuade the great d <UNK> m. de villefort , to come , but have not much hope of seeing him . never despair of anything , says the proverb . do you dance , count ? i dance ? yes , you ; it would not be astonishing . that is very well before one is over forty .: 99.03
<S> as i expected , my officer was there .: 40.05
<S> in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it , then i continued my path .: 57.38
<S> what is proposed to me would be , in fact , almost an abdication , and an abdication requires reflection . an abdication ? repeated anne ; i thought , sir , that it was kings alone who <UNK> ! well , replied mazarin , and am i not almost a king king , indeed , of france ?: 153.77
<S> my captain is dead ; i have barely escaped ; but i am a good sailor .: 69.59
<S> shall you keep it or send it back ? i shall keep it , aramis , and even though i had no need of it i still should keep it .: 54.60
<S> my god , said valentine , raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression , i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter ; i have begged , entreated , implored ; he has regarded neither my prayers , my entreaties , nor my tears .: 98.13
<S> bazin stretched his arms , rubbed his eyes , and tried to go to sleep again .: 37.68
<S> ah , but what is the matter with your hand , d artagnan ?: 16.48
<S> the worthy man , restored to perfect health , was tasting the fine fruit which madame de longueville had sent to him .: 105.67
<S> the air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun ; on the shore the sailors were sitting , chatting and laughing ; and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor , undulating gracefully on the water .: 115.03
<S> grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head .: 36.14
<S> the mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and fortune .: 116.73
<S> whom ? this d artagnan . perfectly well . describe him to me , then . nothing more easy . and d artagnan gave , feature for feature , a description of the comte de wardes .: 107.14
<S> oh , sir , i beg your pardon ! exclaimed raoul , ashamed of so much attention ; in an instant i shall be dressed . athos then called olivain .: 39.49
<S> i kept the third for myself , and i had it hollowed out , which reduced its value , but rendered it more <UNK> for the purpose i intended . everyone looked at monte cristo with astonishment ; he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth , or that he was mad .: 57.56
<S> when they reached the steps raoul saw three horses .: 51.03
<S> had already placed his hand on the knob of the door ; at the noise of m. de tre ville s entrance he turned round .: 29.52
<S> but his majesty s decision is always necessary ; and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns , certain brilliant actions , or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours . d artagnan bowed without replying , feeling his desire to don the musketeer s uniform <UNK> increased by the great difficulties which preceded the <UNK> of it .: 203.75
<S> he kept himself upright and dreamed , without sleeping .: 104.04
<S> on arriving in paris , d artagnan found a letter from m. de tre ville , which informed him that , at his request , the king had promised that he should enter the company of the musketeers .: 20.51
<S> he was the son of a banker at lyons named particelli , who , after becoming a bankrupt , chose to change his name to emery ; and cardinal richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude , had introduced him with a strong recommendation to louis xiii .: 149.47
<S> i have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in prayer .: 59.74
<S> i believe i see double .: 72.72
<S> and madame de villefort , cried baptistin .: 24.99
<S> the place royale .: 40.72
<S> the whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings ; silent shadows were seen <UNK> the streets and others dragging and upsetting great <UNK> , whilst others again dug <UNK> large enough to <UNK> whole regiments of horsemen .: 1252.85
<S> do not believe what albert is telling you , countess ; so far from the sensation excited in the parisian circles by the appearance of the count of monte cristo having abated , i take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever .: 102.77
<S> i never was in a law court ; i am told it is so very amusing ! amusing , certainly , replied the young man , inasmuch as , instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre , you behold in a law court a case of real and genuine distress a drama of life .: 235.21
<S> the two arms fell with a sudden force ; they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim , then a <UNK> mass sank beneath the blow .: 108.10
<S> they had told him to hope for it , but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate .: 45.66
<S> i think you wished to do so of your own accord ? you are right , madame , said the king , and i am ready to retire to my room when you have kissed me .: 19.19
<S> the other seemed to meditate , yet he was more than half asleep .: 55.60
<S> she appeared to be in ecstasy , and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her .: 41.31
<S> the interior of the musketeers when d artagnan was out of the louvre , and consulted his friends upon the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles , athos advised him to order a good repast at the pomme de pin , porthos to engage a lackey , and aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress .: 71.90
<S> the sailors did not require much urging .: 175.53
<S> all would pay deference to an officer like you , with a fierce moustache and a long sabre , but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity . ah , valentine , i assure you you are mistaken . if it were otherwise if he treated me <UNK> that is to say , like a man who wishes , by some means or other , to obtain a footing in the house , so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupants he would , if it had been but once , have honored me with the smile which you <UNK> so loudly ; but no , he saw that i was unhappy , he understood that i could be of no use to him , and therefore paid no attention to me whatever .: 96.74
<S> merce de s read : albert , while showing you that i have discovered your plans , i hope also to convince you of my delicacy .: 66.51
<S> bonacieux saw that he hesitated .: 71.76
<S> strength and sagacity .: 50.58
<S> de winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy .: 23.27
<S> some ham , my boy , or we can t drink . and her brother ? added d artagnan , timidly .: 61.68
<S> but the count of monte cristo surrounds me with every paternal care , and i am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world .: 49.72
<S> my lord , do you remember the little goat <UNK> of the luxembourg ? good , the luxembourg ! one might believe this is an allusion to the queen mother !: 109.25
<S> gentlemen , good morning . as he left the room , debray called out loudly , my carriage . bravo , said beauchamp to albert ; i shall not go to the chamber , but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m. danglars . for heaven s sake , beauchamp , returned morcerf , do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere .: 51.43
<S> there s nothing to do in paris now there s no fronde .: 106.02
<S> m. noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door , then that of the bedchamber , and then extended his hand to villefort , who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal .: 59.88
<S> oh , water is even more scarce than wine , your excellency , there has been such a drought . come , thought danglars , it is the same old story . and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke , he felt his temples get moist with perspiration .: 110.80
<S> the shipowner , smiling , followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng , which from five o clock in the morning until nine o clock at night , swarms in the famous street of la canebie re , a street of which the modern <UNK> <UNK> are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world , and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said , if paris had la canebie re , paris would be a second marseilles . on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him , apparently awaiting orders , but in reality also watching the young sailor , but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of edmond dante s .: 82.12
<S> valentine was sitting at a little distance from them , timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak .: 45.93
<S> and the cards i ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house ? your excellency , it is done already .: 66.32
<S> but , continued the queen , you have doubtless come for some important purpose .: 26.28
<S> perhaps by the time you return to paris , i shall be quite a sober , <UNK> father of a family !: 87.81
<S> the man remained in the village ; the woman had had a relay of horses , and continued her journey .: 65.54
<S> two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass through .: 208.59
<S> bonacieux , who , convinced by what she had just said , saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend .: 97.69
<S> have you seen my mother ? asked albert .: 11.51
<S> it was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he was very fond .: 43.61
<S> i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs .: 43.85
<S> in a month , then , on your honor , if i am not consoled , you will let me take my life into my own hands , and whatever may happen you will not call me ungrateful ? in a month , to the day , the very hour and the date is a sacred one , maximilian .: 46.93
<S> then , wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor , he continued to work without ceasing .: 65.35
<S> monte cristo arose and approached her , took her hand , and said to her in romaic : calm yourself , my dear child , and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors . it is a frightful story , count , said albert , terrified at the paleness of hayde e s countenance , and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request . oh , it is nothing , said monte cristo .: 41.99
<S> while merce de s , as we have said , was making a similar inventory of her property to albert s , while she was arranging her jewels , shutting her drawers , collecting her keys , to leave everything in perfect order , she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage , from which everything could be both seen and heard .: 84.79
<S> i have tried to make you a happy man , and you have turned out a murderer . oh , monsieur , said caderousse , make one more attempt try me once more ! i will , said the count .: 41.02
<S> when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent , he replied that he was a royalist .: 57.40
<S> this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame , and friquet found in it very real enjoyment ; but when at last the regiment separated , penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe , near the rue <UNK> , in which broussel lived , then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast ; and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day , he reflected deeply and decided that councillor broussel should bear the cost of this repast .: 121.05
<S> ah ! said porthos , what a fearful day , my dear d artagnan ! what !: 17.60
<S> morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at half past six .: 266.03
<S> that s it , said d artagnan ; you , monsieur le comte de la fere , to the right of monsieur groslow .: 14.59
<S> tis you , monsieur de chatillon , cried the chevalier ; welcome to you i expected you . i hope i have not made you wait too long , sir , said the duke ; at all events , here i am . monsieur de chatillon , cried aramis , taking from his saddle bags a second pistol , i think if your pistols have been discharged you are a dead man . thank god , sir , they are not ! and the duke , pointing his pistol at aramis , fired .: 43.44
<S> let me see what time it is . danglars watch , one of <UNK> s <UNK> , which he had carefully wound up on the previous night , struck half past five .: 130.18
<S> you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg license when you share it without charge with others .: 27.04
<S> i do sometimes , soldier though i am . monte cristo advanced into the room ; maximilian was obliged to let him pass , but he followed him .: 53.38
<S> i have done . and d artagnan passed to the other side of the room with porthos and aramis .: 17.93
<S> you know , madame , how suddenly i snatched him from those <UNK> which he so imprudently touched ? is it then so terrible a poison ? oh , no !: 106.20
<S> do you not recollect , morcerf , his telling us so at your breakfast ? well , then , said the baroness , if slave she be , she has all the air and manner of a princess . of the arabian nights . if you like ; but tell me , my dear lucien , what it is that constitutes a princess .: 87.71
<S> la ramee continued : my lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper to morrow en tete a tete . grimaud made a sign which meant that he didn t see what that had to do with him .: 65.83
<S> the beggar chapter <UNK> .: 92.09
<S> it was long since he had any reason for his morning s <UNK> , but he always slept all night long .: 103.99
<S> allow me to introduce my friend , baron de cha teau renaud , one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in france , and from whom i have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the champ de mars , yesterday . cha teau renaud bowed to the countess .: 41.99
<S> ah , traitor , cried buckingham , you have killed me ! murder ! screamed patrick .: 53.07
<S> no distraction could come to his aid ; his energetic spirit , that would have exalted in thus <UNK> the past , was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage .: 201.72
<S> from lord de winter ! repeated buckingham ; let him come in . felton entered .: 48.10
<S> indeed , you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration .: 148.10
<S> aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces , the man ended by fairly taking to his heels , and disappeared amid the hooting of the lackeys .: 194.70
<S> the count will find there a charming hotel , with a court and garden . bah !: 110.75
<S> many small donations 1 to 5,000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs .: 53.71
<S> if his eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my musketeers , said tre ville , the justice of monsieur the cardinal is so well known that i demand an inquiry . in the house in which the judicial inquiry was made , continued the impassive cardinal , there lodges , i believe , a young be arnais , a friend of the musketeer . your eminence means monsieur d artagnan . i mean a young man whom you patronize , monsieur de tre ville . yes , your eminence , it is the same . do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel ? to athos , to a man double his age ? interrupted tre ville .: 73.94
<S> a gentleman received , from hand to hand , money from the king , and was not the least in the world humiliated .: 76.28
<S> remember your promise . in five minutes the party entered the courtyard and d artagnan led the prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and ante chamber .: 115.24
<S> and that other gentleman ?: 121.37
<S> he approached the wall , and tried to climb it ; but the wall had been recently pointed , and d artagnan could get no hold .: 47.41
<S> nothing could be better done ; a sun dial could not have shown the hour with greater precision .: 147.05
<S> i congratulate you , my dear m. danglars , said monte cristo ; i see i was deceived , and that you belong to the class of second rate fortunes . i think i may aspire to that honor , said danglars with a smile , which reminded monte cristo of the sickly <UNK> which bad artists are so fond of <UNK> into their pictures of ruins .: 75.03
<S> he has even a name taken from the book , since he calls himself sinbad the sailor , and has a cave filled with gold . and you have seen this cavern , morcerf ? asked beauchamp .: 81.12
<S> mousqueton is here , then ? oh , yes , monsieur .: 23.55
<S> they arrived at amiens at midnight , and alighted at the <UNK> of the golden <UNK> .: 86.73
<S> the executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back , groaning , upon his bed .: 39.63
<S> there is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves . i do not accuse them , sire ; but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the convent des carmes . yes , you are right , tre ville , you are right ! then , upon seeing my musketeers they changed their minds , and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred ; for your majesty can not be ignorant that the musketeers , who belong to the king and nobody but the king , are the natural enemies of the guardsmen , who belong to the cardinal . yes , tre ville , yes , said the king , in a melancholy tone ; and it is very sad , believe me , to see thus two parties in france , two heads to royalty .: 65.90
<S> that you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket . but , cried the bandit , that is only another way of killing me .: 47.51
<S> but first barricade the first door well ; then we will follow yonder cavalier . the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room , as not only to make the passage impassable , but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward .: 152.85
<S> porthos ! cried athos , and laughed aloud .: 25.82
<S> when left alone with bernouin , mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought .: 133.98
<S> back ! shouted d artagnan , or you are dead ! two shots were the reply to this threat ; but the assailants attacked their foes with such <UNK> that in a moment they were upon them ; a third pistol shot was heard , aimed by d artagnan , and one of his adversaries fell .: 122.83
<S> in that case , said he , i should lose her , and by my own fault . he dwelt on this idea for a moment , then it appeared reality .: 46.41
<S> i know not where i have left my hat , and in all probability i should have been left with my hat , had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me . ah , indeed , said the queen , it would have much astonished me if that low <UNK> , with his distorted legs , had not been mixed up with all this . madame , said la meilleraie , do not say too much against him before me , for the service he rendered me is still fresh . very good , said the queen , be as grateful as you like , it does not implicate me ; you are here safe and sound , that is all i wished for ; you are not only welcome , but welcome back . yes , madame ; but i only came back on one condition that i would transmit to your majesty the will of the people . the will ! exclaimed the queen , frowning .: 51.92
<S> ah , good heaven !: 24.12
<S> either they respect or they fear me , which is more likely , but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs , insult and obstruct every one , and i come back still more weary and low spirited , that s all .: 203.43
<S> she asked d artagnan if he had a mistress .: 30.40
<S> the cardinal has a weakness for these men which i can not comprehend . indeed ! yes . well , then , tell him this , rochefort .: 50.19
<S> you are much pleased with yourself , said he to raoul when they were alone , are you not ? well , yes , replied raoul .: 24.63
<S> but nothing could be farther from his thoughts .: 70.65
<S> i never meddle save with what concerns me , and i know how to make believe that i haven t seen what does not concern me ; but i hate hypocrites , and among that number i place musketeers who are abbe s and abbe s who are musketeers ; and , he added , turning to porthos here s a gentleman who s of the same opinion as myself . porthos , who had not spoken one word , answered merely by a word and a gesture .: 108.76
<S> d artagnan , a little recovered from his first surprise , had now leisure to study costumes and physiognomy .: 137.63
<S> he then said , it is time to start ; the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o clock , but perhaps valentine will not wait for that . consequently , morrel , having left the rue meslay at half past eight by his timepiece , entered the clover field while the clock of saint <UNK> du roule was striking eight .: 127.33
<S> at the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire , and he was obliged to obey .: 39.67
<S> you should furnish him with some of course , replied monte cristo .: 47.93
<S> the jailer advanced ; dante s appeared not to perceive him .: 37.33
<S> noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week , and he was now availing himself of that permission .: 84.97
<S> a bad joke of the husband s substituted the other ; but the husband has been punished since , and i have obtained full satisfaction . planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn , leading their masters steeds .: 161.72
<S> what is become of them ? you are very generous , gentlemen of the guards , said athos , full of rancor , for jussac was one of the <UNK> of the preceding day .: 47.20
<S> by the way what ? said albert , seeing that beauchamp hesitated .: 63.54
<S> speak ! the window was again opened slowly , and the same face appeared , only it was now still more pale than before .: 60.00
<S> there came to the court an ambassador so brave , so magnificent , so elegant , that every woman lost her heart to him ; and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them .: 124.44
<S> i humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly , for we have not an instant to lose . but if i accept , it is death , or at least imprisonment , for him who takes my place . he will have had the glory of having saved his king , cried winter .: 77.93
<S> all right ! said caderousse .: 29.00
<S> as i before said , i thought the whole thing was a joke , nothing more .: 64.53
<S> at length , m. de tre ville himself returned .: 14.79
<S> but after he had gone about two hundred steps d artagnan stopped short , alighted , threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his saddle bow to fasten them to his girdle .: 57.61
<S> it is urgent that i should have this money without delay .: 52.23
<S> morbleu , monsieur ! said he , however far i may come , it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners , i warn you . perhaps , said athos .: 36.21
<S> to you i will say , have you not , madame , put aside some of the surest , deadliest , most speedy poison ? <UNK> oh , pardon me , sir ; let me live ! she is cowardly , said villefort .: 85.51
<S> he proposed the conditions the two harnesses , either against one horse or a hundred pistoles .: 102.48
<S> into these pavilions he admitted the elect , and there , says <UNK> <UNK> , gave them to eat a certain <UNK> , which transported them to paradise , in the midst of ever <UNK> shrubs , ever ripe fruit , and ever lovely virgins .: 657.39
<S> next to the merit of <UNK> which you appear to possess , i rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault .: 449.12
<S> i will give you three , replied the stranger .: 12.75
<S> in france , sire , at a small port , near <UNK> , in the gulf of <UNK> . the usurper landed in france , near <UNK> , in the gulf of <UNK> , two hundred and fifty leagues from paris , on the 1st of march , and you only acquired this information today , the 3rd of march !: 113.10
<S> not an instant to be lost !: 43.27
<S> aramis , who had the third canto of his poem to finish , behaved like a man in haste .: 116.16
<S> he wore trousers of blue cloth , boots tolerably clean , but not of the brightest polish , and a little too thick in the soles , <UNK> gloves , a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes , and a black cravat striped with white , which , if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will , might have passed for a halter , so much did it resemble one .: 210.37
<S> owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet , the <UNK> between the performances are very short , the singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their costume , when necessary , while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps .: 295.70
<S> i found the tenant .: 46.99
<S> leave me , then , to act , and have no fears for the result . at least , there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness , in case your excellency should fail . none whatever .: 68.71
<S> here , said he , i want to show you the kind of passport which i have drawn up , and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life i consent to leave you . then turning his eyes from milady to the paper , he read : order to conduct the name is blank , interrupted lord de winter .: 49.36
<S> two minutes a man makes four minutes .: 194.32
<S> the devil ! said porthos .: 6.22
<S> gentlemen , said the count , springing out , when you are tired of being actors , and wish to become spectators of this scene , you know you have places at my windows .: 74.77
<S> for three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory , on which they had settled like a flight of <UNK> , without mixing with the marseillaise population , <UNK> , and preserving their original customs and the costume of their mother country as they have preserved its language .: 209.77
<S> and i mine , said porthos .: 30.71
<S> this being understood , let us proceed with our history .: 109.82
<S> let us see ; with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons , are you rich ?: 119.32
<S> broussel ! halloo !: 146.75
<S> however , you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long . and the count , while pronouncing these latter words , accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor franz d e pinay .: 116.39
<S> my friend , said he , one never has too much money .: 25.89
<S> if that does not suit you , you can point out what other hours you prefer , and in this respect your wishes will be complied with . but am i to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber ? asked milady .: 119.70
<S> there was some surprise , however , that , as he was with his face to the enemy , he should have received a ball between his shoulders .: 32.92
<S> i dare say you know how to <UNK> , should he fail us . my dear friend , you guess well .: 68.70
<S> indeed , the carriage crossed the fatal spot without stopping .: 89.32
<S> he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber , but grated and barred , and its appearance , therefore , did not greatly alarm him ; besides , the words of villefort , who seemed to interest himself so much , resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom .: 89.05
<S> mademoiselle paulet had already gone ; mademoiselle de scudery was going .: 94.21
<S> no ; and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer ; at rome things can or can not be done ; when you are told anything can not be done , there is an end of it . it is much more convenient at paris , when anything can not be done , you pay double , and it is done directly . that is what all the french say , returned signor pastrini , somewhat piqued ; for that reason , i do not understand why they travel . but , said albert , emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs , only madmen , or <UNK> like us , ever do travel .: 100.02
<S> la ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his dinner .: 75.06
<S> they will promise everything for the sake of the money , and on the road fear will prevent them from acting .: 90.64
<S> well , this man .: 22.86
<S> whom does your highness wish me to send to you ? any one , except grimaud . the officer of the guard , then , with his chessboard ? yes . five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime <UNK> of chess .: 81.05
<S> the weather was dull and stormy , a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees , and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards .: 118.60
<S> dante s wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work .: 40.31
<S> yes , replied noirtier with an expression of sinister joy .: 25.23
<S> night came , the two women had watched , hoping that when he left his room morrel would come to them , but they heard him pass before their door , and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps .: 56.11
<S> he <UNK> the evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks .: 770.64
<S> my child , said vasiliki , may god preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread ! then , whispering to selim , she asked what were her master s orders .: 149.82
<S> who talks of killing dante s ?: 111.12
<S> when the soldier saluted charles , athos s heart bounded for joy ; and that unfortunate , on coming to himself , found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket .: 141.98
<S> if you have any preference you can point it out to me ; and if it be not within a thousand leagues of london , attention will be paid to your wishes .: 82.99
<S> raoul had been there about ten minutes , during five of which he was lost in reverie , when there appeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a <UNK> face , who , with a napkin around his body , another under his arm , and a white cap upon his head , approached him , holding paper , pen and ink in hand .: 88.67
<S> he cast himself on his knees , seized the hand , and touched it respectfully with his lips .: 15.09
<S> and i , du barthois , added porthos .: 56.07
<S> i have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy you are a brave youth , d artagnan , interrupted the cardinal , tapping him familiarly on the shoulder , charmed at having vanquished this rebellious nature .: 118.94
<S> a sob was the only sound he heard .: 62.80
<S> the article having been read during the painful hush that followed , a universal shudder pervaded the assembly , and immediately the <UNK> attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks .: 223.80
<S> yes , madame , said the young man .: 4.73
<S> yes , with frenchmen , and frenchmen like you . and monsieur du vallon , added the other .: 60.02
<S> monsieur le marechal , said the queen , after a moment s reflection , go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me . and what shall i say to the people ? that they must have patience , said anne , as i have . the fiery spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply ; he bowed and went out .: 42.02
<S> oh , good lord , cried porthos , what precautions for the study of theology ! gentlemen , gentlemen , said d artagnan , do not let us lose our time in jesting .: 39.83
<S> the favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes you . if i durst say what i believe on that head what you believe ? i ought rather to say , what i know . what you know ? and even what i am sure of . and of what are you so sure ? i would say that i know this great lady . you ? yes ; i. and how do you know her ? oh , monsieur , if i could believe i might trust in your discretion . speak !: 57.78
<S> ten leagues of wood , of <UNK> land and <UNK> ; he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the bishop of noyon ! good , said d artagnan to himself .: 169.54
<S> well , did there not happen an event which saved austria ?: 280.26
<S> supposing this person , wearied at the <UNK> of the poison , should , as monte cristo intimated , have recourse to steel ! what if the count should have no time to run to her rescue ! what if her last moments were approaching , and she should never again see morrel !: 151.98
<S> we lost five men , and the rochellais eight or ten . <UNK> ! said the swiss , who , notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths possessed by the german language , had acquired a habit of swearing in french .: 133.74
<S> under any circumstances , he resumed , you are welcome , my dear friend ; you will help me to recover my spirits ; to morrow we will hunt the hare on my plain , which is a superb <UNK> of land , or pursue the <UNK> in my woods , which are magnificent .: 103.26
<S> we will go on , gentlemen , said the queen .: 7.54
<S> it was merce de s , who , hearing no news of her lover , had come unobserved to inquire after him .: 32.81
<S> i will die here , and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens ! you shall have no weapon left in your power . there is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it .: 130.76
<S> from him whom you have rendered the happiest of men , comte de wardes this note was in the first place a forgery ; it was likewise an <UNK> .: 126.72
<S> and how did he look ? asked porthos , who , perceiving that d artagnan had allowed the conversation to drop , profited by it to put in a word or two .: 55.32
<S> this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security .: 61.99
<S> at length when they found they were likely to be really in want , they got together , as a last effort , eight or ten pistoles , with which porthos went to the gaming table .: 80.19
<S> who wants me ? a man who will not tell his name , but who comes from the cardinal . and who wishes to speak with me ? who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from boulogne . then let him come in , if you please . oh , my god , my god ! cried mme .: 32.33
<S> see !: 35.16
<S> the great <UNK> lost that of <UNK> ; and francis the first , who was , as i have heard say , as good as other folks , nevertheless lost the battle of <UNK> . and i have the honor of assuring you that i killed one of them with his own sword , said aramis ; for mine was broken at the first parry .: 119.06
<S> all this must be prepared against .: 58.28
<S> thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given , as you have done for the last six months , out of pure christian charity ; that would be too grand .: 138.36
<S> i demand , then , that the examination shall take place as soon as possible , and i will furnish the house with all necessary information . what day do you fix ? asked the president .: 41.83
<S> the house , as i said , is between the court and the garden ; in this way , do you see ? andrea drew the garden , the court and the house .: 44.74
<S> this house is part of valentine s marriage portion , and m. de saint me ran wished to sell it ; for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin . it was morrel s turn to become pale .: 91.27
<S> ah , ah ! said porthos , it appears we are feasting ! i hope , said aramis , there are no women at your dinner . is there any <UNK> wine in your tavern ? asked athos .: 42.10
<S> he was , as we have already said , perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries .: 34.52
<S> like adventurous captains about to embark on some enterprise full of danger , i laid in my provisions , i loaded my weapons , i collected every means of attack and defence ; i inured my body to the most violent exercises , my soul to the <UNK> trials ; i taught my arm to slay , my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings , and my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles .: 365.50
<S> ask of me , as mayor , what is my opinion of m. morrel , and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree , and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality .: 103.40
<S> it was morrel alone who remembered with alarm , that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50,000 francs of m. de boville , and on the 30th the 32,500 francs of bills , for which , as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons , he had time granted , he must be a ruined man .: 82.70
<S> and kill him , said porthos .: 20.50
<S> you forget , sir , that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master ; and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer , whilst all the time his true vocation was the church . my dear bazin , you ought to perceive , said d artagnan , from the place in which you find me , that i am greatly changed in everything .: 78.57
<S> her beautiful face was distorted with agony ; her glassy eyes had no longer their sight ; a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body ; the sweat rolled from her brow .: 98.01
<S> how does this misfortune affect you ?: 57.86
<S> well , how is he now ? asked he .: 9.31
<S> therefore , leaving directions at every place for grimaud , they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the lys .: 104.50
<S> the count s eye expanded ; he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully , and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel .: 101.25
<S> you see i have not these necessary papers . fortunately , i have them , though , said monte cristo .: 50.23
<S> m. de tre ville was the father of his soldiers .: 17.00
<S> he has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me ; but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another , and he never would .: 61.52
<S> is it not true ? the magistrate laid emphasis on these words , as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself , while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who , <UNK> for another , had himself need of indulgence .: 89.82
<S> but i still trust you will not esteem me the less for it , and that is my object beyond all others . m. de tre ville was surprised to the greatest degree .: 63.81
<S> hold !: 61.43
<S> but however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine , she met this time with a countenance of such <UNK> that no discovery followed her investigation .: 138.68
<S> suddenly planchet entered , bringing two letters for d artagnan .: 69.72
<S> and the man ? a plain and simple beggar , as i have said , my lord , who asks for alms , as he gives holy water ; a practice he has carried on for six years on the steps of st. eustache . and you say that he has a great influence over his <UNK> ? are you aware , my lord , that <UNK> is an organized body , a kind of association of those who have nothing against those who have everything ; an association in which every one takes his share ; one that <UNK> a leader ? yes , i have heard it said , replied the coadjutor .: 100.09
<S> the mask and beard became you very well , and as to the axe , i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment .: 53.06
<S> idiots !: 117.72
<S> and why revenge ? he asked .: 35.86
<S> take in the <UNK> sails and stow the flying jib . it was time ; the <UNK> was on us , and the vessel began to heel .: 275.92
<S> or richelieu for two of these armchairs , adorned with a carved shield , on which were engraved the fleur de lis of france on an azure field , evidently came from the louvre , or , at least , some royal residence .: 159.06
<S> besides , continued the young man , if there did appear some defect in education , or offence against the established forms of etiquette , i suppose it would be excused , in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth , and followed me through my youth . well , said monte cristo in an indifferent tone , you will do as you please , count , for you are the master of your own actions , and are the person most concerned in the matter , but if i were you , i would not divulge a word of these adventures .: 61.51
<S> hasty actions are generally bad ones .: 718.03
<S> the unfortunate woman was exhausted , not by fatigue , but by terror , and when d artagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder , she sank upon one knee , crying in a choking voice , kill me , if you please , you shall know nothing ! d artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist ; but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting , he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness .: 48.28
<S> m. de boville said nothing , but nodded his head , and took up the portfolio .: 45.77
<S> as if the same idea had animated these two beings , merce de s was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his .: 66.59
<S> egad !: 25.42
<S> in june the profit amounted to 900,000 .: 497.85
<S> still further , de wardes , whom he had treated so ill , was one of the tools of his eminence ; and d artagnan knew that while his eminence was terrible to his enemies , he was strongly attached to his friends .: 42.26
<S> i can see nothing but his back , resumed grimaud .: 44.40
<S> in a turn of the hand she muffled him up in a <UNK> robe , a large hood , and a cloak .: 88.74
<S> but , continued monte cristo , you are not in your usual spirits ? i have a dreadful <UNK> , said albert .: 31.47
<S> she is not dead ; demons do not die so easily .: 92.94
<S> at the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket , and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her .: 49.35
<S> at each previous visit he had made to rome , he had solicited and obtained the same favor ; and incited as much by a religious feeling as by gratitude , he was unwilling to quit the capital of the christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of st. peter s <UNK> who has set the rare example of all the virtues .: 184.60
<S> how did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left ? he is not a prince ; simply a count . a count , and a rich one too , eh ? yes ; but you had better not have anything to say to him , for he is not a very good tempered gentleman . oh , be easy !: 60.71
<S> for the emperor s return ? the emperor is no longer on the throne , then ? he <UNK> at fontainebleau in 1814 , and was sent to the island of elba .: 61.03
<S> fernand was <UNK> in the active army , went to the frontier with his regiment , and was at the battle of <UNK> .: 112.54
<S> a ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing .: 75.54
<S> it was necessary that d artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber .: 41.70
<S> the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dante s forehead large drops of perspiration .: 85.93
<S> why ? i do not know .: 11.29
<S> the man , somewhat crest fallen by the rebuke he had received , repeated what the concierge had said .: 183.06
<S> presently there are not a sufficient number of people here yet ; we shall be remarked . at this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor .: 67.53
<S> how he had found grace in the eyes of the minister , he did not know ; but without doubt m. de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at home .: 50.85
<S> alas , what would become of me who can only <UNK> for evil by doing good ? <UNK> then he said aloud : listen , morrel , i see your grief is great , but still you do not like to risk your soul . morrel smiled sadly .: 97.70
<S> our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village , and enter with us one of the houses , which is <UNK> to the beautiful dead leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country , and within <UNK> with <UNK> , like a spanish <UNK> .: 161.70
<S> barrois made some steps towards his master .: 45.36
<S> it is the people who do not obey that i punish , and not those who , like you , obey but too well .: 72.26
<S> from their dress , covered with dust , and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always <UNK> , the two friends excited the attention of a few <UNK> .: 120.89
<S> so much the better , duke , so much the better , said the king , advancing toward the door .: 11.65
<S> i swear by my honor as a sailor , by my love for merce de s , by the life of my father speak , monsieur , said villefort .: 28.51
<S> it will be useless for him to find you here . she rang the bell and kitty appeared .: 36.76
<S> come in , my lord , said philip in a low tone , and i will show you something droll . morcerf entered , and in place of the usual target , he saw some playing cards fixed against the wall .: 78.14
<S> then she threw herself upon her knees , and began to pray .: 18.55

<S> you came from a country where he must be very much talked of , and i know that his armaments against france greatly engage the attention of your friend the cardinal . my friend the cardinal ! cried milady , seeing that on this point as on the other lord de winter seemed well instructed .: 91.54
<S> ah , my dear athos , i am greatly afraid i have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us ! d artagnan then related all the mad passion of milady and her menaces of death .: 76.69
<S> madame bonacieux ! murmured d artagnan .: 15.41
<S> the night lamp threw out countless rays , each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination , when suddenly by its flickering light valentine thought she saw the door of her library , which was in the recess by the chimney piece , open slowly , though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned .: 185.80
<S> with patience one must succeed .: 399.25
<S> may i also be allowed , said morcerf , to pay my respects to mademoiselle danglars ? wait a moment , said the banker , stopping the young man ; do you hear that delightful <UNK> ?: 51.20
<S> if you be a priest , i conjure you in the name of humanity to follow me to aid this man ; if you be not , it is a different matter , and i warn you in the name of courtesy , of which you appear profoundly ignorant , that i shall <UNK> you for your insolence . the pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange , that raoul , whose eyes were still fixed upon him , felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult .: 56.30
<S> arrived at the bastion , the four friends turned round .: 27.15
<S> he converted his chamber into an <UNK> .: 164.75
<S> here , he said , here is a draft at sight . and here is your fowl . danglars sighed while he carved the fowl ; it appeared very thin for the price it had cost .: 92.99
<S> the prisoner glanced at the windows they were grated ; he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither .: 174.68
<S> true , they could send for the headsman of the nearest town , but at least a day would be gained , and a day might be sufficient for the rescue .: 61.35
<S> they placed themselves on guard ; the stranger made a feint and a lunge , and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the parade , he had already three inches of steel in his breast .: 99.05
<S> then listen to me .: 27.24
<S> i obey my captain s orders .: 43.73
<S> the man who was with caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of france ; he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the beaucaire fair , and who during the month the fair lasts , and during which there is so great an <UNK> of merchants and customers from all parts of europe , often have <UNK> to the amount of 100,000 to 150,000 francs .: 164.01
<S> pardieu ! if you succeed with him , i pronounce you the demon himself . he went toward the door and opened it hastily .: 61.85
<S> monseigneur ! au revoir , monsieur bonacieux , au revoir ! and the cardinal made him a sign with his hand , to which bonacieux replied by bowing to the ground .: 52.31
<S> merely because one might have died , carelessly answered monte cristo .: 155.77
<S> at the end of the second day m. de villefort received the following note : the person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord wilmore , a rich foreigner , who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this moment ; he is also known to the abbe busoni , a sicilian priest , of high <UNK> in the east , where he has done much good . m. de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons ; his orders were executed , and the following evening he received these details : the abbe , who was in paris only for a month , inhabited a small two <UNK> house behind saint sulpice ; there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant .: 72.31
<S> let us see the ground floor , said caderousse .: 17.21
<S> why do you mention my father ? stammered he ; why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today ? because i am he who saved your father s life when he wished to destroy himself , as you do today because i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister , and the pharaon to old morrel because i am the edmond dante s who nursed you , a child , on my knees . morrel made another step back , staggering , breathless , crushed ; then all his strength give way , and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo .: 70.24
<S> he was thinking of mme .: 12.10
<S> aramis , on the contrary , struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement .: 93.86
<S> i was executioner of the city of lille , as this woman has said .: 66.57
<S> but , dear friend , if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you . thereupon aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades .: 42.67
<S> i shall become worthy of her gratitude ; but shall i likewise return worthy of your love ? the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks .: 124.29
<S> but what are you going to fight about , athos ? asked aramis .: 14.22
<S> i have fought too long ; they have sold me , they shall give me up , and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads . sire , said athos , perhaps a king should act thus , but not a husband and a father .: 94.52
<S> it is i who lose my cause , and it is ill luck , obstinacy , and folly which have caused it to be decided against me . to what do you refer ? said monte cristo with well feigned interest .: 58.00
<S> captivity : the first day let us return to milady , whom a glance thrown upon the coast of france has made us lose sight of for an instant .: 67.63
<S> the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings ; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent , lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast <UNK> waves .: 234.48
<S> in a moment the whole party was assembled .: 38.87
<S> i hope he does not bring our breakfast with him . oh , no ; our breakfast comes from my father s kitchen .: 51.53
<S> speak , speak , in heaven s name ! and raoul fell back trembling upon his chair .: 45.98
<S> when he saw the formidable and chosen body with which louis xiii .: 81.29
<S> milady breathed a sigh , and opened her eyes .: 14.48
<S> finally , athos undertook to provide , in any event , the means of leaving england in case either of failure or of success .: 206.44
<S> is he not your friend ? replied the baron , negligently .: 35.36
<S> i mean that m. de monte cristo , digging underneath these trees , found neither skeleton nor chest , because neither of them was there ! neither of them there ? repeated madame danglars , her staring , wide open eyes expressing her alarm .: 180.48
<S> well !: 14.47
<S> at the barrie re du <UNK> ne they met bertuccio , who was waiting there , motionless as a sentinel at his post .: 94.84
<S> noirtier , for whom france was a vast chess board , from which <UNK> , <UNK> , knights , and queens were to disappear , so that the king was <UNK> m .: 322.13
<S> i do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits ; when you see one prisoner , you see all , always the same thing , ill fed and innocent .: 180.15
<S> it was time ; for athos , whose great courage alone supported him , sank upon his knee .: 74.48
<S> one light alone was visible ; and dante s saw that it came from merce de s chamber .: 40.25
<S> but what can be the matter ?: 14.29
<S> d artagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for porthos , but for a consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it , he consented that porthos should share his couch with him .: 108.59
<S> it was like a besieged town .: 99.62
<S> go and see , cocles , and if my father is there , announce this gentleman . it will be useless to announce me , mademoiselle , returned the englishman .: 40.97
<S> five hundred pistoles . that is to say , two hundred more a hundred pistoles for you and a hundred pistoles for me .: 27.10
<S> do you wish a step , or some place in the government ? sir , will you grant me my request ? let us hear what it is , first . sir , when you have told me to obey an order did i ever answer , let me see that order ? if , however , your wish should be one impossible to fulfill ? when you have cherished a wish and have charged me with its <UNK> , have i ever replied , it is impossible ? but a request preferred with so much preparation ah , do not fear , sir , said mordaunt , with apparent simplicity : it will not ruin you . well , then , said cromwell , i promise , as far as lies in my power , to grant your request ; proceed . sir , two prisoners were taken this morning , will you let me have them ? for their ransom ?: 75.55
<S> a kind of steward appeared , just as d artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount .: 39.63
<S> we must play the game to the end , and consent to be blindfolded . ah , you shall see ; i promise you i will sustain my part to admiration . i never once doubted your doing so . monte cristo chose this moment for re entering the drawing room .: 76.94
<S> ay , said porthos , if we can not leave the camp , our lackeys may . to be sure they may ; and this very day we will write the letters , said aramis .: 43.94
<S> then our gascon , extending his arms , drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another .: 68.95
<S> five hundred roman crowns are three thousand lire , and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married .: 100.87
<S> you will restore them to her majesty ; and as a last <UNK> he looked round for some valuable object you will add he still sought ; but his eyes , darkened by death , encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of felton , still smoking with the blood spread over its blade .: 140.15
<S> and to you also , m. morrel , my thanks are due .: 77.79
<S> this man , named emery , was the object of popular <UNK> , in the first place because he was superintendent of finance , and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated ; in the second place , because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred .: 136.93
<S> i am even sorry that this evening i almost repulsed but there will be a conference to morrow and we shall see . the two friends saluted the duke .: 54.91
<S> to quote some latin verses i have forgotten , or rather , never knew well , the thunderbolt never falls on the <UNK> , and i am a valley , dear rochefort , one of the <UNK> of the low . then mazarin is still mazarin ? the same as ever , my friend ; it is said that he is married to the queen . married ? if not her husband , he is unquestionably her lover . you surprise me .: 114.42
<S> finally , farmer louis sold them eighty trusses , making in all four hundred and thirty .: 377.53
<S> i have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur d herblay and myself to do in your service .: 37.95
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> indeed , said porthos , looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away , you are right , d artagnan ; mouston will do ; mouston has a very fine appearance . d artagnan smiled .: 48.04
<S> excellency , said he gravely , addressing franz , if you look upon me as a liar , it is useless for me to say anything ; it was for your interest i albert does not say you are a liar , signor pastrini , said franz , but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us , but i will believe all you say ; so proceed . but if your excellency doubt my veracity signor pastrini , returned franz , you are more susceptible than <UNK> , who was a <UNK> , and yet no one believed her ; while you , at least , are sure of the <UNK> of half your audience .: 71.56
<S> come , now , he said .: 9.14
<S> i own to you that that young man s visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my sleep .: 152.52
<S> the price of his blood ! she murmured .: 43.86
<S> he was to have waited for me at the corner of the rue du muse e , but , strange to say , he was not there when i returned . monsieur morrel ! exclaimed a voice on the stairs ; monsieur morrel ! it is his voice ! said julie .: 34.43
<S> those were good old days ; never fear these people owe us no grudge . is your honor sure ? i can answer for it they do not . well , we won t speak of it any more , then ; and planchet took his place in d artagnan s suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master , which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed .: 118.78
<S> adieu , sir . one word one single word more , doctor !: 92.57
<S> you will make tea for us , baptistin , said the count .: 33.11
<S> well , said the prisoner , when the door was shut , i am not so far advanced as i believed .: 28.73
<S> if his excellency will recollect if he will think ah , true , observed monte cristo ; i recollect now .: 68.71
<S> all faithful hearts with me ! cried out winter .: 151.22
<S> half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly ; the count had just pulled the silken check string , which was fastened to ali s finger .: 74.20
<S> do you understand me ? cried monte cristo .: 7.20
<S> when he came here , monsieur d artagnan provoked and <UNK> the soldiers and inferior officers , in order , i suppose , to have his sword back .: 82.22
<S> at five o clock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had .: 34.65
<S> but athos rose likewise , drew his sword , and placed himself in the way .: 23.26
<S> he departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he awaited . you know not the subject of their conversation ? he gave her a box , told her not to open it except in london . was this woman english ? he called her milady . it is he ; it must be he ! murmured tre ville .: 99.23
<S> name a few of those whom you know , and you will see if they are my friends . well ! said milady , embarrassed , i know monsieur de <UNK> , monsieur de <UNK> , monsieur de <UNK> . the novice let her speak , then seeing that she paused , she said , don t you know a gentleman named athos ? milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying , and mistress as she was of herself , could not help uttering a cry , seizing the hand of the novice , and devouring her with looks .: 68.11
<S> maximilian s avowal at the same moment m. de villefort s voice was heard calling from his study , what is the matter ? morrel looked at noirtier who had recovered his self command , and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances , he had taken refuge .: 87.50
<S> the king s closet at the tuileries chapter <UNK> .: 66.55
<S> though all bowed before her , as etiquette required , she had now but a single arm on which she could lean .: 147.76
<S> she has taken care for herself , at least i hope so , for her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me .: 73.41
<S> but all my fortune is in england .: 30.43
<S> in short , what shall i say to you , felton ? continued milady , in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a crime .: 29.71
<S> franz had been to announce the ceremony , and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him ; the death of m. de saint me ran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness .: 95.48
<S> if we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable .: 60.48
<S> barcelona has risen in his favor . all that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of danglars , who had sold his shares , and of the luck of the stock <UNK> , who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow .: 120.03
<S> though danglars could not see peppino , the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation .: 107.27
<S> but we must not lose time .: 27.47
<S> oh , if so , punish me as you will ; but do not do not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and constrained . hayde e , replied the count , you know that you are now in france , and are free . free to do what ? asked the young girl .: 45.39
<S> i , who was looking on , an eager and curious spectator , i , who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy , i , who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful , i am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course i was watching , and bitten to the heart ! morrel groaned .: 193.75
<S> eh , he said , negligently , this money is not mine .: 34.48
<S> what is the king doing ? they asked .: 32.12
<S> at last louis xiii .: 33.81
<S> more than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal , whose police , without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police , were excellent , being better informed than himself , even upon what was going on in his own household .: 99.86
<S> if there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden .: 50.09
<S> yes , said the man , thrusting his hands into his pockets , and looking impudently at the youth ; i have taken the whim into my head ; do you understand , master benedetto ? at this name , no doubt , the young man reflected a little , for he went towards his groom , saying : this man is right ; i did indeed charge him with a commission , the result of which he must tell me ; walk to the barrier , there take a cab , that you may not be too late . the surprised groom retired .: 70.06
<S> i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day . then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain , caderousse hastily exclaimed : a thousand pardons !: 141.97
<S> now then , said d artagnan , this is something like ; this is a means of communication .: 28.29
<S> madame , replied villefort , with a mournful smile , i have already had the honor to observe that my father has at least , i hope so abjured his past errors , and that he is , at the present moment , a firm and zealous friend to religion and order a better royalist , possibly , than his son ; for he has to <UNK> for past <UNK> , while i have no other impulse than warm , decided preference and conviction . having made this well turned speech , villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory , much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court .: 134.40
<S> but he was no longer there , having withdrawn on the previous evening to la <UNK> , <UNK> by false intelligence of the enemy s movements .: 126.26
<S> the mother and daughter passed the night together .: 77.97
<S> ah , m. de villefort , cried he , i am delighted to see you .: 9.96
<S> you must look out for yourself . what have i to fear , replied d artagnan , as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties ? everything , believe me .: 40.24
<S> progress of cavalcanti the younger meanwhile m. cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service , not in the army of his majesty the emperor of austria , but at the gaming table of the baths of lucca , of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers .: 67.45
<S> the vicomte and myself will go and find a priest . go , sir , replied the tutor ; but in heaven s name do not expose yourself to danger ! do not fear .: 54.69
<S> hayde e is a very uncommon name in france , but is common enough in albania and epirus ; it is as if you said , for example , chastity , modesty , innocence , it is a kind of baptismal name , as you parisians call it . oh , that is charming , said albert , how i should like to hear my <UNK> called mademoiselle goodness , mademoiselle silence , mademoiselle christian charity !: 153.29
<S> come , louise , let us talk of our affairs .: 27.47
<S> whenever your majesty pleases .: 149.57
<S> it is a demand that porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds ; but i know he must be so at present . we thought so , too , monsieur .: 58.82
<S> pull down the blinds , said d artagnan .: 29.22
<S> having seen jacopo fairly out of the harbor , dante s proceeded to make his final <UNK> on board la jeune ame lie , distributing so liberal a <UNK> among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all , and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him .: 197.94
<S> what the devil can you do with all that ? oh , it is no trouble to spend that ; and i am like you , i want capital . capital ? yes i understand everyone would like capital . well , and i shall get it . who will give it to you your prince ? yes , my prince .: 50.75
<S> madame de villefort , unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head , at that moment held her son s ball , and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss .: 80.19
<S> d artagnan interpreted it ; with a terrible bound he sprang to the side of cahusac , crying , to me , monsieur guardsman ; i will slay you ! cahusac turned .: 119.14
<S> he resumed his listening , but unfortunately the toilet was finished .: 80.77
<S> even on the night of the prince s return , some citizens , <UNK> than the rest , such as the <UNK> , captains and the quartermaster , went from house to house among their friends , saying : why do we not take the king and place him in the hotel de ville ?: 110.99
<S> if there is a third shot , said he to himself , i am a lost man . he immediately , therefore , took to his heels and ran toward the camp , with the <UNK> of the young men of his country , so renowned for their agility ; but whatever might be his speed , the first who fired , having had time to reload , fired a second shot , and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat , and carried it ten paces from him .: 71.90
<S> in truth , my dear captain , i have a great mind to take away your commission and give it to mademoiselle de <UNK> , to whom i promised an abbey .: 46.05
<S> downstairs in the decanter . <UNK> downstairs ? in the kitchen . shall i go and fetch it , doctor ? inquired villefort .: 107.15
<S> i will have my eye upon you , for i shall be there , replied the cardinal , pointing with his finger to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear , and on our return , well we will settle our account ! ah , monseigneur , cried d artagnan , spare me the weight of your displeasure .: 58.33
<S> from behind the door a human figure appeared , but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed , and therefore only stared , hoping to recognize morrel .: 147.13
<S> at dessert d artagnan <UNK> in his chair , crossed one leg over the other and <UNK> about like a man perfectly at his ease .: 135.45
<S> bring the prisoner in again , said the cardinal .: 37.28
<S> go , leave me ; i would be alone .: 24.67
<S> comminges was near the queen , who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition , and every one was listening to his account , when d artagnan and porthos were perceived at the door , behind the cardinal .: 41.68
<S> but grimaud s <UNK> was more <UNK> than his speech , and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses .: 256.80
<S> no . from you ? yes . you thoroughly understand me , sir ?: 44.60
<S> did he allude to his hope of being captain ? he spoke of it as a thing already decided . indeed ! said danglars , he is in too much hurry , it appears to me . why , it seems m. morrel has promised him the thing . so that he is quite elated about it ? why , yes , he is actually insolent over the matter has already offered me his patronage , as if he were a grand personage , and <UNK> me a loan of money , as though he were a banker . which you refused ? most assuredly ; although i might easily have accepted it , for it was i who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned ; but now m. dante s has no longer any occasion for assistance he is about to become a captain . pooh ! said danglars , he is not one yet . ma foi ! it will be as well if he is not , answered caderousse ; for if he should be , there will be really no speaking to him . if we choose , replied danglars , he will remain what he is ; and perhaps become even less than he is . what do you mean ? nothing i was speaking to myself .: 64.55
<S> good heavens !: 14.43
<S> bonacieux ; help ! then , collecting all her strength , she took the head of the young man between her hands , looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look , and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his .: 54.54
<S> yes , just so .: 30.73
<S> on seeing them athos and aramis stood still .: 54.20
<S> as they reached the shore , the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat , and the owner was obliged to call out , in his sweetest tone of voice : sir , we are at the landing . monte cristo remembered that on that very spot , on the same rock , he had been violently dragged by the guards , who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets .: 78.27
<S> tis he !: 44.64
<S> the <UNK> in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great , that were i obliged to affirm by oath what i have now stated , i should hesitate ; i therefore repeat to you , i speak not to a magistrate , but to a friend .: 110.54
<S> the castle of bragelonne .: 48.14
<S> in the home of the witty abbe dwelt incessant laughter ; there all the <UNK> of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed , <UNK> , <UNK> , some into <UNK> , some into <UNK> , that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little scarron , listening to what he said , <UNK> it to others .: 415.93
<S> you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england , added she , with a melancholy smile , and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto . i am completely ignorant of it , madame , said the cardinal , accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders ; alas , our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor , incapable , <UNK> old minister like me . well , then , your eminence , said the queen , i must inform you that charles i. , my husband , is on the eve of a decisive engagement .: 74.22
<S> the crime which i have committed , my lord , has no call upon human justice , and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently , as you have just done . come , be candid , said the coadjutor , you have not all your life followed the trade which you do now ? no , my lord .: 60.84
<S> i told you so ! exclaimed madame de villefort .: 13.47
<S> m. de villefort answered nothing , but sat , or rather threw himself down again upon his chair .: 44.03
<S> besides , you have made an eternal friend of madame de villefort . the count bowed , and contented himself with seeing villefort to the door of his cabinet , the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen , who , on a signal from their master , followed him with every mark of attention .: 47.05
<S> it was warm work . we were in a place where it was not very cold , replied porthos , giving his mustache a <UNK> which was peculiar to him .: 67.77
<S> to join the army , under the prince , count . and i , too ! exclaimed the young man , in a transport of joy .: 24.87
<S> the next day kitty went to see the young man again , and related to him all that had passed on the preceding evening .: 20.39
<S> they entered , for the door was not locked there is much confidence among <UNK> .: 195.93
<S> porthos followed , chatting with aramis .: 100.45
<S> the hour , then , for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived .: 42.76
<S> her hands clutched her armchair ; she ground her teeth <UNK> ; her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind lord de winter and felton , and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her .: 99.97
<S> franz paused for a moment .: 26.30
<S> but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health .: 65.13
<S> reverend sir ! you lie !: 112.13
<S> caderousse climbed the ladder slowly , and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet .: 86.67
<S> so little that it is not worth reckoning with the general stock . now , then , let us calculate how much we <UNK> in all . porthos ? thirty crowns . aramis ? ten pistoles . and you , d artagnan ? twenty five . that makes in all ? said athos .: 80.10
<S> what is the matter with my horse ? your horse is falling , said porthos , <UNK> in his own .: 44.95
<S> in fact , he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream , or at least the delirium of a fever .: 49.48
<S> it must have been delirium ; she fancies , too , that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass . it is singular , said the doctor ; i was not aware that madame de saint me ran was subject to such <UNK> . it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition , said valentine ; and this morning she frightened me so that i thought her mad ; and my father , who you know is a strong minded man , himself appeared deeply impressed . we will go and see , said the doctor ; what you tell me seems very strange . the notary here descended , and valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone .: 66.21
<S> oh , is it you , dear friends ?: 28.62
<S> meanwhile , the queen every hour had been sending for d artagnan .: 73.13
<S> that is well , said mme .: 10.98
<S> well , replied d artagnan , bending his mouth to athos s ear , and lowering his voice , milady is marked with a fleur de lis upon her shoulder ! ah ! cried the musketeer , as if he had received a ball in his heart .: 31.18
<S> the queen entered .: 13.66
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> look at m. andrea cavalcanti , the young man in a black coat , looking at murillo s madonna ; now he is turning . this time bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation , had not a look from monte cristo silenced him .: 69.04
<S> good heavens ! he exclaimed .: 9.56
<S> is life worth the trouble of so many questions ?: 117.41
<S> we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts <UNK> on their securities , and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin .: 176.61
<S> their toilet finished , they descended ; the carriage awaited them at the door , filled with sweetmeats and bouquets .: 99.46
<S> duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidly only they had agreed to meet once a week , about one o clock , at the residence of athos , seeing that he , in agreement with the vow he had formed , did not pass over the threshold of his door .: 102.42
<S> what we are going to say does not concern your majesty . the king , smiling , turned a few steps back .: 31.55
<S> you believed me to be dead , did you not , as i believed you to be ?: 30.92
<S> athos , do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets , roast beef reasonably cooked , and wine which is not made of <UNK> and <UNK> ? i think i know what you want , replied athos .: 188.15
<S> i returned home at daybreak , and strove to sleep ; but my head <UNK> and i got up to have a ride for an hour .: 77.94
<S> come , monsieur bazin , make yourself easy , said d artagnan ; people of all conditions gain the kingdom of heaven . monsieur was already such a good <UNK> , said bazin , almost weeping ; he might have become a bishop , and perhaps a cardinal . well , but my poor bazin , reflect a little .: 92.12
<S> this embarrassment had completely escaped albert , but it caused lucien to shorten his visit ; he was evidently ill at ease .: 159.05
<S> being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys , a thousand pistoles to each of you , if you will assist my escape ; but if you deliver me up to your masters , i have near at hand <UNK> who will make you pay dearly for my death . grimaud hesitated .: 107.23
<S> scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears began to <UNK> , a faintness seized him , a cloud of blood passed over his eyes , and he fell in the middle of the street , crying still , coward !: 63.07
<S> jussac fell like a dead mass .: 237.73
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> but the queen pressed the child s hand .: 22.77
<S> bonaparte m. dandre looked at louis xviii. , who , employed in writing a note , did not even raise his head .: 114.82
<S> at this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out , surrounding the two frenchmen .: 66.72
<S> there was , above all , one room , continued monte cristo , very plain in appearance , hung with red damask , which , i know not why , appeared to me quite dramatic . why so ? said danglars ; why dramatic ? can we account for instinct ? said monte cristo .: 89.66
<S> have you gone mad , my dear friend ? what is the matter ? returned d artagnan ; we are saved ! i don t see that at all , answered porthos .: 17.43
<S> but this favor which you bestow upon me i do not merit .: 94.14
<S> consider well what you do in that house .: 94.19
<S> d art exclaimed athos , whilst the gascon covered his mouth with his hand .: 135.96
<S> is she there , grimaud ? asked athos .: 21.39
<S> those in whom the king has confided lord leven s highlanders . no , said winter , then he paused ; but tell me , can you not perceive the <UNK> <UNK> which marks the heavens ? not the least in the world , said aramis and athos at once .: 105.64
<S> well , asked the abbe , as he returned to the apartment below , what have you made up your mind to do ? to tell you all i know , was the reply .: 25.29
<S> parry was not wrong .: 46.32
<S> only , in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us , he wishes you to relate to him , as i have done already , the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession .: 54.33
<S> the insult at the banker s door beauchamp stopped morcerf .: 141.43
<S> behind the head of the bed , and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion , was a hollow space , and in this space a ladder of <UNK> between twenty five and thirty feet in length .: 126.41
<S> cardinal mazarin as king .: 186.23
<S> this movement was observed by mordaunt .: 42.26
<S> i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle valentine ; if he be a sensible man , he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed , and will secure my friendship , and love until death ; if he refuse , either through interest or ridiculous pride , after i have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me , that valentine loves me , and will have no other , i will fight with him , give him every advantage , and i shall kill him , or he will kill me ; if i am victorious , he will not marry valentine , and if i die , i am very sure valentine will not marry him . noirtier watched , with indescribable pleasure , this noble and sincere countenance , on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted , adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing .: 86.24
<S> you saw the person ? repeated the young girl .: 33.60
<S> a gentleman has but his word , and i have given you mine . with a heavy heart , d artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry .: 58.26
<S> the term for which edmond had engaged to serve on board la jeune ame lie having expired , dante s took leave of the captain , who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew , but having been told the history of the <UNK> , he ceased to <UNK> him further .: 102.41
<S> you can see it in his eye .: 44.76
<S> the lookout has signalled her , and they say she is now coming into port . <UNK> my dear friends , said morrel , if this be so , it must be a miracle of heaven !: 77.45
<S> the cemetery of pe re lachaise m. de boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking valentine to her last home on earth .: 119.47
<S> you told me to wait and hope ; do you know what you did , unfortunate adviser ?: 76.41
<S> two persons were coming down the stairs ; he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them .: 100.39
<S> wretch ! she cried , will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with ? i do not say that i did know it , and i do not say that i did not know it .: 20.12
<S> he guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurator s wife of the rue aux ours , which was the more probable from the church of st. leu being not far from that <UNK> .: 93.08
<S> your horse is tired already , he <UNK> at the mouth , whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable .: 143.05
<S> soon he saw the lights of la consigne .: 116.25
<S> tell him to come to me immediately , if he has returned . the count is here , said the officer , and requests to speak with your eminence instantly . let him come in , then ! said the cardinal , quickly .: 34.66
<S> the abbe d herblay .: 12.09
<S> the latter put his hand to his sword , and said , with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death : would you assassinate me , sir ?: 37.66
<S> and their captain see !: 254.19
<S> a nurse of the doctor s choice succeeded them , and never left till about ten or eleven o clock , when valentine was asleep .: 88.84
<S> the night was extremely dark .: 53.34
<S> however , be that as it may , the young man made a tunnel , how or by what means no one knows ; but he made it , and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work .: 100.04
<S> the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court , was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal .: 86.05
<S> the horses , which were more kindly used than on the previous day , stopped at arras at four o clock in the evening .: 51.13
<S> aramis came behind , giving his arm to porthos .: 51.95
<S> my lord ! cried the gascon , don t threaten !: 19.74
<S> scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye .: 56.28
<S> yes , if my friends agree . but if they refuse can i count on you ? i have never accomplished anything alone , said d artagnan , shaking his head .: 50.68
<S> i have chosen the drawing room , sir , as our place of meeting , in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a banker s study .: 90.23
<S> and you , porthos ? faith !: 16.11
<S> as the doctors entered the street , they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door .: 35.84
<S> it is very clear , notwithstanding , replied the young man , with an artlessness wholly free from affectation ; tell her some fine morning an unheard of piece of intelligence some telegraphic despatch , of which you alone are in possession ; for instance , that henri iv .: 182.96
<S> then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention , but which he always answered in the same tone of voice , either kill , or pardon . it is very strange , said albert , to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage , and one needs constantly to be saying to one s self , this is no fiction , it is all reality , in order to believe it .: 80.17
<S> mouston appeared , with a most piteous face .: 188.45
<S> i dread this marriage , maximilian , as much as you . thank you , my adored valentine , thank you ; that is enough .: 43.85
<S> and what have i done , dear grandpapa , that you should be angry with me ? cried valentine .: 15.50
<S> from this view of things , then , comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action , seek first to discover the person to whom the <UNK> of that bad action could be in any way advantageous .: 219.72
<S> the king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation ; although , distant as they were from the queen , they could not count the studs .: 73.07
<S> you will do much better to open the window and let down some bread , a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend planchet , who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands . planchet , in fact , had <UNK> and fed his horses , and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon .: 108.43
<S> but alas , if he was the friend of d artagnan , he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence ; if he was the friend of d artagnan , he was the enemy of the cardinal ; and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer .: 51.90
<S> my god !: 11.06
<S> well , said franz to his friend , what think you of all this ? why , upon my soul , my dear fellow , it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock <UNK> who has <UNK> in the fall of the spanish funds , or some prince travelling incog . hush , hush ! replied franz ; we shall ascertain who and what he is he comes ! as franz spoke , he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges , and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside , and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men .: 95.69
<S> oh , sir , said villefort , arresting maximilian by the arm , if my father , the inflexible man , makes this request , it is because he knows , be assured , that valentine will be terribly revenged .: 54.36
<S> the gascons are the <UNK> of france . d artagnan bowed to the duke , and was retiring .: 56.11
<S> in the lucern patch our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding m. de villefort s house , and , behind the gate , half screened from view by the large chestnut trees , which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches , we shall find some people of our acquaintance .: 115.81
<S> we know the count s vigorous and daring mind , denying anything to be impossible , with that energy which marks the great man .: 160.19
<S> i wish to say three words to you , monsieur chevalier , stammered the soubrette .: 42.30
<S> who knows but that , in order to please madame de villefort and my father , he may not persecute me by every means in his power ?: 44.28
<S> the baron d e pinay was my friend , as you know , and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged . do you think , said madame de villefort , that valentine is in league with him ?: 35.77
<S> ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horsemen .: 20.66
<S> then , to justify myself , i should say that you gave me the money ; this would cause inquiries , it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice , and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean .: 66.71
<S> madame de villefort was overpowered ; her eyes first flashed and then swam , she staggered towards the door and disappeared .: 61.96
<S> the queen reflected for a moment and then , seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer : perhaps you like repose ? she said .: 87.52
<S> fortunately , i don t know where he is . how ! cried d artagnan ; you don t know where aramis is ? formerly , replied bazin , aramis was his name of perdition .: 29.00
<S> at this time , that is , about half past twelve , madame danglars ordered her carriage , and went out .: 29.65
<S> who has given them to us ? said porthos .: 22.04
<S> the cavalier laughed aloud , which appeared to exasperate milady still more .: 128.67
<S> oh , my god , my god , cried mme .: 8.24
<S> andrea had , then , in a fortnight , attained a very fair position .: 66.84
<S> you seem incredulous , said monte cristo , who repeated to ali in the arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french .: 58.03
<S> tomorrow you will go .: 28.43
<S> it was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed , but had not had sufficient strength to do so .: 25.15
<S> otherwise , his head was perfectly clear , and his body refreshed ; he was free from the slightest <UNK> ; on the contrary , he felt a certain degree of lightness , a faculty for absorbing the pure air , and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever .: 172.63
<S> this noble entrance , however , in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases , as they waved their <UNK> leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom , had fallen into utter <UNK> .: 228.23
<S> the spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century ; and in those times , when other opportunities for <UNK> were wanting , such <UNK> of gold and jewels were by no means rare ; there are at this day roman families <UNK> of hunger , though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels , handed down by entail , and which they can not touch . edmond thought he was in a dream he <UNK> between incredulity and joy .: 249.41
<S> well , well , said monte cristo quietly , i see you wish to quarrel with me ; but i would give you one piece of advice , which you will do well to keep in mind .: 26.75
<S> this box contained an <UNK> substance partly solid , of which it was impossible to discover the color , owing to the reflection of the polished gold , sapphires , rubies , emeralds , which ornamented the box .: 128.77
<S> what has m. franz to do with it ?: 29.64
<S> he passed over my head and i heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps .: 105.04
<S> the affair was not long , i assure you .: 25.95
<S> he gave us some very fine horses . and moreover , very handsome saddles , said porthos , who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own .: 99.56
<S> well , this is just what amuses me , said monte cristo .: 20.27
<S> will it be the same this evening ?: 23.64
<S> not yet , replied porthos .: 24.77
<S> i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter s hand .: 57.32
<S> he held out his hand .: 10.87
<S> when she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features , i saw she was from eighteen to nineteen , tall and very fair .: 125.36
<S> he is not dead , then ? no , monsieur , he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in his body ; for you , without question , inflicted four upon the dear gentleman , and he is still very weak , having lost almost all his blood .: 59.91
<S> well ? said he in a low voice .: 6.85
<S> unluckily , as i was then in bearn , on account of my father s death , the letter followed me there .: 59.02
<S> 12 jacques louis david , a famous french painter <UNK> <UNK> .: 3527.79
<S> the grating against the library door aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged , and which almost amounted to insensibility .: 166.03
<S> aramis , after a journey into lorraine , disappeared all at once , and ceased to write to his friends ; they learned at a later period through mme .: 127.21
<S> now , madame danglars feared euge nie s sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle d armilly ; she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray , an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother s amorous and pecuniary <UNK> with the intimate secretary ; moreover , she saw that euge nie detested debray , not only because he was a source of <UNK> and scandal under the paternal roof , but because she had at once <UNK> him in that catalogue of bipeds whom <UNK> endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men , and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers .: 228.02
<S> no one had entered the house since i had left it .: 28.62
<S> comminges , wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead , had left a picket in the street and returned to the palais royal , followed by a menacing crowd , to tell his story .: 52.54
<S> this plan succeeded ; and signor pastrini himself ran to him , excusing himself for having made his excellency wait , <UNK> the waiters , taking the candlestick from the porter , who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to albert , when morcerf himself appeared .: 114.16
<S> let us wait for a de nouement for the day when the prince , thanks to you , shall have turned against the court . madame de longueville was persuaded .: 74.86
<S> you promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother .: 52.84
<S> you heard m. de villefort talking to m. d avrigny about the death of m. de saint me ran , and that no less surprising , of the countess .: 41.06
<S> shall two members of the house be sent to yanina ?: 144.72
<S> dante s began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy , and , thrusting his hands into his hair , continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend .: 92.90
<S> by jove !: 26.06
<S> sometimes he hoped it could not be mme .: 71.50
<S> no , monseigneur .: 13.07
<S> as for himself , he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of chestnuts in flower , amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy bees , and bade olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink , to be placed on a table which he found there , <UNK> ready .: 190.71
<S> let us wait ; and , as i said before , let us speak of yourself .: 22.63
<S> on these days he spoke a little .: 50.28
<S> is she , then , the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guilty ?: 220.50
<S> what end would that answer ?: 114.72
<S> go away now , mouston . so he s called mouston , thought d artagnan ; tis too long a word to pronounce mousqueton . well , he said aloud , let us resume our conversation later , your people may suspect something ; there may be spies about .: 121.48
<S> bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled .: 48.02
<S> calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the rue notre dame .: 191.79
<S> the watchword is , king and re . saying these words , the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head , and took the right hand , followed by his attendant for that night he himself slept in the camp .: 83.12
<S> however , the duke contrived to hide the ball under his <UNK> and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball with his teeth and found underneath the following letter : my lord , your friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at hand .: 88.37
<S> first , madame , who are you ? who am i ?: 33.46
<S> from twelve to two o clock danglars had remained in his study , <UNK> his dispatches , and becoming more and more sad every minute , <UNK> figure upon figure , and receiving , among other visits , one from major cavalcanti , who , as stiff and exact as ever , presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before , to terminate his business with the banker .: 172.03
<S> if he should really be guilty , said he , and did really put in to the island of elba ; if he is really charged with a letter for the bonapartist committee at paris , and if they find this letter upon him , those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices . i confess i had my fears , in the state in which politics then were , and i held my tongue .: 85.25
<S> he fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him .: 25.69
<S> well , said d artagnan to athos , you see , my dear friend , that this is war to the death . athos shook his head .: 12.66
<S> raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort ; he called out to him , but they were too distant to be heard ; then , in spite of the weariness of his beast , he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers , and when he had again attained a new height , the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank .: 83.35
<S> he smiles at them .: 87.93
<S> let us now go into the adjoining chamber , which is your apartment , and ali will bring us coffee and pipes . they both arose , and while he who called himself sinbad and whom we have occasionally named so , that we might , like his guest , have some title by which to distinguish him gave some orders to the servant , franz entered still another apartment .: 135.45
<S> hello , lovely <UNK> !: 1085.15
<S> whither does your excellency desire to be driven ? to the residence of baron danglars , rue de la chausse e d antin . this conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace , from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriage drive .: 67.41
<S> this <UNK> <UNK> the accuracy of the aim .: 581.14
<S> franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment ; the table was splendidly covered , and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him .: 136.69
<S> pretty , mysterious , initiated in almost all the secrets of the court , which reflected such a charming gravity over her pleasing features , it might be surmised that she was not wholly unmoved ; and this is an irresistible charm to novices in love .: 156.83
<S> wild dreams had disturbed his repose .: 466.27
<S> it does , replied the abbe ; with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dante s , which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four <UNK> . and why among us four ? inquired caderousse .: 128.84
<S> what do i think , captain ?: 18.96
<S> it was then that the door of edward s room opened , and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite ; it was madame de villefort , who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared .: 65.01
<S> we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for , given , and received ; and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved , when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected .: 92.75
<S> yes , count , said milady , in her softest voice , and pressing his hand in her own , i am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met .: 47.42
<S> accomplish the orders of lord de winter , said felton , with a gloomy smile .: 26.63
<S> himself , captain himself . very well , show him to me . at this rather impertinent order , peppino raised his torch to the face of danglars , who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt .: 127.85
<S> it is for you , replied a gendarme .: 20.43
<S> nevertheless , if the affairs of our family are arranged , as we hope they will be , i believe she will run the risk of being damned , and will return to those she regrets , particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her .: 68.49
<S> in conscience , i can not kill him ; and yet , added he , with a coldly menacing expression , he annoys me .: 42.36
<S> those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them ; the mere sound of it filled them with terror .: 166.95
<S> scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair .: 48.09
<S> the cardinal s house had no secrets for me .: 53.81
<S> albert listened , trembling now with hope , then with anger , and then again with shame , for from beauchamp s confidence he knew his father was guilty , and he asked himself how , since he was guilty , he could prove his innocence .: 77.76
<S> and when you are looking forward to be captain , it was wrong to annoy the owner . but i explained to him the cause of my refusal , replied dante s , and i hope he fully understood it . yes , but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one s <UNK> . i hope to be captain without that , said dante s .: 68.75
<S> his rider was a priest , dressed in black , and wearing a three cornered hat ; and , spite of the ardent rays of a <UNK> sun , the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity .: 90.85
<S> you were my tutor , why did you not teach me to swim ? oh , monsieur le comte , replied the old man , had any misfortune happened to you , i should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again . but how did the accident happen ? asked raoul .: 36.14
<S> still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention ; it evidently was there i had turned up the ground .: 209.84
<S> we have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame .: 191.75
<S> well ? asked the young girl , with an <UNK> tone the count had never observed before , and which startled him .: 51.45
<S> no , no , cried bertuccio , setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall .: 37.13
<S> i wish that this event , which on the day it is known will completely change the aspect of affairs , should be accomplished without the knowledge of any others but yourself , myself , and a third person . and who is this third person ? monsieur le prince . he has come , then , as they told me ? last evening . and you have seen him ? he has just left me . and will he aid this project ? the plan is his own . and paris ? he will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion . the plan is not wanting in grandeur ; i see but one impediment . what is it ? impossibility . a senseless word .: 81.46
<S> another of the number , continued the abbe , without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse , is called danglars ; and the third , in spite of being my rival , entertained a very sincere affection for me . a <UNK> smile played over the features of caderousse , who was about to break in upon the abbe s speech , when the latter , waving his hand , said , allow me to finish first , and then if you have any observations to make , you can do so afterwards .: 60.32
<S> the other drank it only by accident , and , although barrois is dead , it was noirtier whose death was wished for . but why did it not kill my father ? i told you one evening in the garden after madame de saint me ran s death because his system is accustomed to that very poison , and the dose was trifling to him , which would be fatal to another ; because no one knows , not even the assassin , that , for the last twelve months , i have given m. noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection , while the assassin is not ignorant , for he has proved that brucine is a violent poison . oh , have pity have pity ! murmured villefort , wringing his hands .: 73.07
<S> holloa , patrick ! sign , my lord ! never . never ? help ! shouted the duke ; and at the same time he sprang toward his sword .: 58.25
<S> these <UNK> who <UNK> in our epoch the <UNK> of another reign are troublesome ; since there are two of them already there , let us add a third . athos was not altogether the queen s dupe , but he was not a man to run away on suspicion above all , when distinctly told that he should see his friends again .: 195.14
<S> and now our readers must leave the standard to sail peaceably , not toward london , where d artagnan and porthos believed they were going , but to durham , whither mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at boulogne , and accompany us to the royalist camp , on this side of the tyne , near newcastle .: 97.71
<S> tell me , mouston , said porthos , are my arms in good condition ? your arms , my lord what arms ? zounds !: 97.40
<S> spada knew what these invitations meant ; since <UNK> , so eminently <UNK> , had made progress in rome , it was no longer a <UNK> who came from the tyrant with a message , c sar wills that you die . but it was a <UNK> a <UNK> , who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope , his holiness requests you to dine with him . spada set out about two o clock to san pierdarena .: 261.85
<S> and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents ? asked debray .: 86.88
<S> arrived in his bedroom , the count motioned to ali to stop ; then he passed into the dressing room , which he examined .: 39.85
<S> planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol .: 55.67
<S> faithless court !: 999.75
<S> i come to ask to be your captain , said the young man .: 21.30
<S> your history is quite a romance , and the world , which delights in romances in yellow covers , strangely <UNK> those which are bound in living parchment , even though they be gilded like yourself .: 350.10
<S> you are irritated and vexed tell me how this fernand is related to you ? he is merely my father , said albert m .: 116.32
<S> one was a young man of three or four and twenty , who was in love with m. morrel s daughter , and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw ; the other was an old one eyed cashier , called cocles , or cock eye , a <UNK> given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted <UNK> <UNK> , and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not , in all probability , have replied to anyone who addressed him by it .: 99.41
<S> she had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure , when , on the very evening of coming to this decision , mme .: 121.92
<S> the woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house ; she had scarcely closed the door after her when monte cristo appeared at the corner of a street , so that he found and lost her again almost at the same instant .: 51.42
<S> go , gentlemen , he said ; you must be much fatigued after your voyage .: 27.49
<S> olivain obeyed and continued on his way , whilst raoul remained sitting , with his elbow leaning on the table , from time to time gently shaking the flowers from his head , which fell upon him like snow , and gazing vaguely on the charming <UNK> spread out before him , dotted over with green fields and groups of trees .: 129.11
<S> but d artagnan remained <UNK> .: 66.35
<S> ma foi , i haven t consulted my daughter ; but if she has good taste oh , said monte cristo , my fondness may blind me , but i assure you i consider morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction , and his father s position is good . hem , said danglars .: 94.84
<S> madame , said albert , allow me to present to you m. maximilian morrel , captain of spahis , one of our best , and , above all , of our bravest officers . i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil , at the house of the count of monte cristo , replied madame de villefort , turning away with marked coldness of manner .: 37.11
<S> why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation . simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand ; and i have noticed that what ? that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand <UNK> , that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform . you have evidently seen and observed everything . let us proceed . oh , yes , yes ! now as regards the second question . i am listening . was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with merce de s ? yes ; a young man who loved her . and his name was fernand . that is a spanish name , i think ? he was a catalan . you imagine him capable of writing the letter ? oh , no ; he would more likely have got rid of me by <UNK> a knife into me . that is in strict accordance with the spanish character ; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit , but an act of cowardice , never . besides , said dante s , the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him . you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone ? to no one . not even to your mistress ? no , not even to my betrothed . then it is danglars . i feel quite sure of it now . wait a little .: 111.69
<S> no , said bonacieux , but yesterday i went to st. mande to make some inquiries after a servant , as i can not possibly do without one ; and the roads were so bad that i brought back all this mud , which i have not yet had time to remove . the place named by bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions d artagnan had conceived .: 99.91
<S> polish up or make some one else polish my arms .: 882.61
<S> but his sleep was a nightmare , which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes <UNK> and sometimes <UNK> .: 118.37
<S> yes , borgia has been here , a torch in one hand , a sword in the other , and within twenty paces , at the foot of this rock , perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea , while their master descended , as i am about to descend , dispelling the darkness before his awe inspiring progress . <UNK> but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret ? asked dante s of himself .: 172.02
<S> albert placed it in his button hole , and the carriage went triumphantly on .: 64.49
<S> give me your word , gentlemen , that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other . is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that , my little viper ? no , but to set my mind at rest , as you observed just now . it is for something else than that , i imagine , muttered d artagnan , shaking his head doubtfully .: 48.17
<S> everything lies in the execution . good , the execution of plots is my <UNK> . i know it well .: 144.22
<S> that of the home department , or of the <UNK> ? oh , no ; i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant , and who would try to explain to me , in spite of myself , a mystery which even they do not understand .: 76.32
<S> hardly <UNK> for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family .: 62.28
<S> the dragoon and the swiss followed him , and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the swiss .: 58.46
<S> hem ! said d artagnan , what does my lord think of that reply ? man of talent ! cried mazarin .: 37.98
<S> i am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you , mademoiselle , solemnly assuring you that i wish your life may be so calm , so happy , and so fully occupied , that there may be no place for me even in your memory . oh ! murmured valentine .: 55.66
<S> his soldiers formed a legion of devil may care fellows , perfectly <UNK> toward all but himself .: 738.98
<S> then came a skirmish , the more terrible because it had no definite object ; the more melancholy , because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting .: 151.03
<S> but i know you , my lad , said athos , appearing on the threshold .: 19.17
<S> i therefore may hesitate between you .: 118.37
<S> franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat , but when he had finished , he inquired : what , then , is this precious stuff ? did you ever hear , he replied , of the old man of the mountain , who attempted to assassinate <UNK> <UNK> ? of course i have . well , you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name .: 138.56
<S> ha ! answered porthos , behold , other players appear . and in fact , two other cavaliers made their appearance , detached , as it seemed , from the principal group ; they again disputed the road .: 145.43
<S> and you think you can catch him ? yes , if we are better mounted than he . go then , take what guards you find here , and pursue him . you command us , my lord , to do so ? and i sign my orders , said mazarin , taking a piece of paper and writing some lines ; monsieur du vallon , your barony is on the back of the duc de beaufort s horse ; you have nothing to do but to overtake it .: 52.66
<S> the less pretension there is in your attire , the better will be the effect , as you are a rich man .: 89.43
<S> it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head .: 47.80
<S> i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me , and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come , and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will . he must be a prophet , then , said valentine , smiling .: 67.03
<S> endure nothing from anyone except monsieur the cardinal and the king .: 121.55
<S> the ceremony of reception over , the four friends were soon in one another s arms .: 54.55
<S> only imagine , my dear friend .: 25.68
<S> that little stout man , short and elderly , that sort of lackey , dressed in dark clothes , treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort , was bonacieux himself .: 385.24
<S> it was m. de villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family , as though they had been strangers .: 80.83
<S> i hope these gentlemen have theirs . i will inquire , said morrel .: 39.06
<S> a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m. danglars ; the count , in return for his gentlemanly bow , received a formal though graceful courtesy , while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition , and with danglars a free and easy nod .: 284.52
<S> at the sight of d artagnan , who entered the courtyard on horseback , bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken .: 31.69
<S> i must go to the chamber , for our life is not an idle one . you only breakfast ; i await two persons , and the instant they arrive we shall sit down to table . chapter 40 .: 81.97
<S> nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed .: 77.92
<S> we ought to die together .: 34.22
<S> a letter from charles the first .: 93.17
<S> so , d artagnan resumed , you will not become a partisan of mazarin s ? nor you of the prince de conde ? no , let us belong to no party , but remain friends ; let us be neither cardinalists nor frondists . adieu , then . and d artagnan poured out a glass of wine .: 75.38
<S> do not copy , display , perform , distribute or redistribute this electronic work , or any part of this electronic work , without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.e.1 with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the project gutenberg license .: 16.33
<S> i had better get on horseback , and go and meet her .: 51.35
<S> no , no , my boy ; i prefer remaining honorably in the capital . andrea <UNK> .: 116.46
<S> he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart .: 73.08
<S> the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends , and athos , advancing a few paces in front of the others , cried in a firm voice , who goes there ? who goes there , yourselves ? replied one of the horsemen .: 73.12
<S> he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor ; but the horses were unharnessed , and others put in their places , without anyone claiming money from the traveller .: 132.09
<S> the mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife , whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold fringe .: 93.50
<S> as to d artagnan , he took care not to give the least sign of existence .: 26.48
<S> parry knew this room , as he had often been to see me when the king was at newcastle .: 62.34
<S> the king , however , who sought distraction , while traveling as fast as possible for he was anxious to be in paris by the twenty third stopped from time to time to fly the magpie , a pastime for which the taste had been formerly inspired in him by de luynes , and for which he had always preserved a great <UNK> .: 101.45
<S> albert , as he took off his dress , carefully preserved the bunch of violets ; it was his token reserved for the morrow .: 68.63
<S> meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast , had got some water from a spring , spread out the fruit and bread , and cooked the kid .: 153.22
<S> no , said villefort , burying his face in his hands , no , a hundred times no ! then you did not bury the poor child there , sir ?: 45.92
<S> during the meal , which was excellent , and admirably served , franz looked repeatedly at albert , in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer ; but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him , whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him , or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone , he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them , but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is , the worst in the world .: 78.06
<S> although the coadjutor had <UNK> that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the fronde ; and mazarin , in requesting the archbishop of paris to make his nephew preach , had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de retz one of those italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving .: 179.23
<S> this state of mental anguish is , however , less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow .: 139.68
<S> be easy on that head , replied athos ; you know i am cool enough . porthos and aramis resumed their places by the <UNK> .: 49.01
<S> at one corner , where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day , a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house , which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it , though situated but a hundred paces off .: 264.60
<S> let us suppose one thing , replied the duke let us suppose , for instance , that my maitre d hotel , noirmont , has purchased the shop of pere marteau well ? said la ramee , shuddering .: 104.19
<S> as far as you yourself are concerned , i see but one point in which you are really guilty .: 76.01
<S> frightful ! murmured athos , while porthos broke the bottles and aramis gave orders , a little too late , that a confessor should be sent for .: 133.87
<S> look , said d artagnan , day is declining .: 53.46
<S> they had not yet begun to slay , but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting .: 62.38
<S> there goes one ! cried athos , at the end of five hundred paces .: 23.89
<S> you see , said athos .: 10.64
<S> but what redoubles my sorrow , continued the young girl , as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment , is that the poor old lady , on her death bed , requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible ; she also , thinking to protect me , was acting against me . hark ! said morrel .: 67.56
<S> i am entirely at your service , except only for my orders . thank you , sir ; what i am about to ask will not compromise you in any degree . if it should even compromise me a little , said monsieur de comminges , with a smile , still make your demand .: 43.03
<S> of course .: 23.42
<S> they halted for a minute , during which he strove to collect his thoughts .: 39.60
<S> no , fifteen thousand are not enough , i can not again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs . no , replied andrea , dryly , no , i can not . i do not think you understand me , replied caderousse , calmly ; i said without your laying out a sou . do you want me to commit a robbery , to spoil all my good fortune and yours with mine and both of us to be dragged down there again ? it would make very little difference to me , said caderousse , if i were <UNK> , i am a poor creature to live alone , and sometimes pine for my old comrades ; not like you , heartless creature , who would be glad never to see them again . andrea did more than tremble this time , he turned pale .: 75.65
<S> then you must have something on your mind ! said athos .: 24.44
<S> of course not ! rejoined caderousse quickly ; no more do i , and that was what i was observing to this gentleman just now .: 95.81
<S> however , if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg work in a format other than plain <UNK> <UNK> or other format used in the official <UNK> posted on the official project gutenberg website www.gutenberg.org , you must , at no additional cost , fee or expense to the user , provide a copy , a means of <UNK> a copy , or a means of obtaining a copy upon request , of the work in its original plain <UNK> <UNK> or other form .: 262.91
<S> the proposal was seductive , but la ramee was an old stager , acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set .: 139.99
<S> in anticipation of some ambuscade in each of these little woods the tutor placed his two servants at the head of the band , thus forming the advance guard .: 164.56
<S> villefort was about to retire , but m. de blacas , taking his hand , restrained him .: 30.94
<S> well yes , you are right ; that name has still its charms , and this is the first time for a long period that i have pronounced it so distinctly .: 64.53
<S> ah ! said he , raising himself on his elbow , is it you , comte de la fere ? yes , sire , replied athos .: 12.69
<S> edmond found some solace in these ideas .: 165.09
<S> my lord , said the guard , i have simply mentioned the prophecy i heard from a man named coysel , who believes that , be he ever so closely watched and guarded , the duke of beaufort will escape before whitsuntide . coysel is a madman ! returned the cardinal .: 151.85
<S> hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded .: 124.70
<S> the <UNK> of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself , with its thickly planted courtyard , opening into the faubourg saint honore , and to the garden shut in by this gate , which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen garden of about an acre .: 182.37
<S> yes , replied beauchamp .: 9.78
<S> well , i swear to you , all three , that had the executioner of bethune was he not of bethune ? yes , egad !: 45.59
<S> to the boat ! but porthos , i do not see him . porthos is coming he swims like <UNK> . in fact , porthos did not appear ; for a scene , half tragedy and half comedy , had been performed by him with mousqueton and blaisois , who , frightened by the noise of the sea , by the whistling of the wind , by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them , shrank back instead of going forward .: 104.18
<S> good caderousse , he said , how happy you will be . i will do my best , said the innkeeper of the pont du gard , shutting up his knife .: 44.12
<S> yes , madame , i expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty .: 27.96
<S> he who presumed to be a rival of yours , for which he was severely punished ; that ought to satisfy you . yes , but it does not ; i am <UNK> the only <UNK> that proves me to be a churchman .: 102.40
<S> in a splendid chamber of the palais royal , formerly styled the palais cardinal , a man was sitting in deep reverie , his head supported on his hands , leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers .: 69.07
<S> certainly , replied the count , are we not in carnival time ? carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her , and saying a few words to him , pointed with her finger to teresa .: 46.64
<S> he was approached to be examined , and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat , that he was an officer of the musketeers , he was surrounded , with the intention of making him cry , down with mazarin ! the demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first ; but when he discovered what it meant , he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied .: 65.59
<S> i ?: 34.71
<S> you are the best companion that i know , d artagnan , he said , offering his hand to the gascon ; and i am very happy in having found you again , my dear son . this was , as we have seen , the term which athos applied to d artagnan in his more expansive <UNK> .: 44.62
<S> and do you comprehend , grimaud ? said aramis .: 16.87
<S> at about what time did we see the two swiss guards walking yesterday ? an hour after <UNK> . if they go out to day as they did yesterday we shall have the honor , then , of seeing them in half an hour ? in a quarter of an hour at most . your arm is still strong enough , is it not , porthos ? porthos <UNK> his sleeve , raised his shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm , as large as the leg of any ordinary man .: 87.18
<S> how can you remember what monsieur de richelieu did ?: 42.00
<S> if you arrive safely at home what have i to fear , except from you ? if you reach your home safely , leave paris , leave france , and wherever you may be , so long as you conduct yourself well , i will send you a small annuity ; for , if you return home safely , then then ? asked caderousse , shuddering .: 78.21
<S> i never believe in anything i have not seen , and as i never have seen apparitions , i don t believe in them . the bible , said aramis , makes our belief in them a law ; the ghost of <UNK> appeared to <UNK> , and it is an article of faith that i should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon , porthos . at all events , man or devil , body or shadow , illusion or reality , this man is born for my damnation ; for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair , gentlemen an affair by which there were a hundred pistoles , and perhaps more , to be gained . how is that ? cried porthos and aramis in a breath .: 134.24
<S> to day it s a sort of diplomatic arrangement ; ask planchet . mousqueton inquired , therefore , the state of the case of his old friend , who confirmed the statement of d artagnan .: 100.00
<S> monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure , and was not long in finding a little wooden gate , working on willow hinges , and fastened with a nail and string .: 127.33
<S> its agent , who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of 287,500 francs , i will not say granted , but offered me three months .: 142.88
<S> i have seen that , mother ; i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors , and have punished them .: 100.34
<S> the police of marseilles will be on the alert by land , whilst the governor pursues me by sea .: 130.71
<S> sir , thanks ! cried madame de chevreuse , seizing his hand and trying to put it to her lips ; you have a noble heart . i bring him to you , madame , said athos , withdrawing his hand , hoping that in your turn you will do something for him ; till now i have watched over his education and i have made him , i hope , an accomplished gentleman ; but i am now obliged to return to the dangerous and wandering life of party faction .: 52.74
<S> what , he stammered , do you mean to keep that money ?: 39.69
<S> it was not known whether , after the taking of the bastion , the rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it ; the object then was to examine the place near enough to verify the reports .: 144.21
<S> i have charged myself with this affair .: 24.65
<S> it was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned , for as soon as d artagnan appeared , before even he had asked if milady were visible , one of them ran to announce him .: 52.33
<S> your captivity shall be mild , be assured ; and as every inconvenience deserves its <UNK> , here is , in addition to the price of the studs , an order for a thousand pistoles , to make you forget the annoyance i cause you . d artagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister , who thus open handed , sported with men and millions .: 131.02
<S> occasionally , but seldom , he played at whist , and then care was taken to select <UNK> worthy of him sometimes they were ambassadors , sometimes <UNK> , or sometimes a prince , or a president , or some dowager duchess .: 380.22
<S> at the end of the next act , with your permission , i will come and inquire whether there is anything i can do for you in paris ? pray take notice , said the countess , that my present residence is 22 rue de <UNK> , and that i am at home to my friends every saturday evening .: 77.25
<S> the soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger , worn out with fatigue , ready to desert , gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward .: 446.42
<S> i say you understand this , because you are as conversant with my affairs as i am ; indeed , i think you understand them better , since i am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my fortune , once very tolerable , while i am sure , madame , that you know perfectly well .: 37.63
<S> he knew his time well the hour when valentine was giving noirtier his breakfast , and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty .: 83.46
<S> i ask much , too much , perhaps , for i have no title to request it .: 36.13
<S> noirtier , resumed m. d avrigny in the same pitiless tone , m .: 60.65
<S> he then descended , but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety .: 58.92
<S> is he prosperous and happy ? he died a more wretched , hopeless , heart broken prisoner than the <UNK> who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon . a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse , who turned away , and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head .: 140.81
<S> every morning morrel called on noirtier to receive news of valentine , and , extraordinary as it seemed , each day found him less uneasy .: 120.40
<S> all his limbs have become completely <UNK> , he has lost his voice also , and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning . noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine , which look was at once so earnest and imperative , that she answered immediately .: 176.25
<S> d artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by m. de tre ville to treat for a supply of horses , and that he had brought back four as specimens .: 43.48
<S> franz was deeply affected .: 50.41
<S> i m your man . i begin to think so , particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal . here it is , sir , and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief , tied at each corner .: 54.16
<S> felton began to descend the ladder slowly , step by step .: 112.59
<S> this advice appeared good to the future chancellor .: 154.33
<S> milady , being well prepared for the reception of felton , was able to erect her <UNK> for the next day .: 71.79
<S> the good captain leclere is dead , father , and it is probable that , with the aid of m. morrel , i shall have his place .: 32.09
<S> then he rested ; he must be near chapelle en serval , where he pretended to be going .: 123.95
<S> the young count , witty and caustic , passed all the world in review ; the queen herself was not spared , and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule .: 130.74
<S> under his assumed name , in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held .: 113.61
<S> hope ! faintly murmured fernand , but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips , and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance .: 105.89
<S> and what will he promise us ? said d artagnan .: 12.84
<S> why , to accuse the man , do you address the woman ? do i know m. debray ? do i wish to know him ? do i wish to know that he gives advice ? do i wish to follow it ? do i speculate ?: 42.15
<S> i should be glad , however , to receive your excellency s commands concerning the dinner . really , my dear m. bertuccio , said the count , since you have been in paris , you have become quite nervous , and apparently out of your element ; you no longer seem to understand me . but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive ? i do not yet know myself , neither is it necessary that you should do so .: 44.95
<S> mousqueton is <UNK> against the door and here s the key . bravo ! said aramis , how did you manage it ? like everything else , with money ; but it cost me dear . how much ? asked athos .: 74.86
<S> she had already been an hour in this apartment ; they could not long delay bringing her a repast .: 83.97
<S> but look !: 80.59
<S> afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage .: 54.73
<S> from fifty to sixty musketeers , who appeared to replace one another in order always to present an imposing number , paraded constantly , armed to the teeth and ready for anything .: 212.02
<S> oh , god be praised , he said ; it is a real bed ! this was the second time within the hour that he had <UNK> the name of god .: 40.27
<S> if i wished to surprise him , it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him .: 68.22
<S> you will , of course , dispose of it in some way or other ? yes . in favor of some member of your family ? no . do you intend <UNK> it to charitable purposes , then ? pursued the notary .: 83.49
<S> caderousse rose .: 28.86
<S> let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary <UNK> , and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find here that is to say , a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds . ma foi , my dear sir , replied franz , make no apologies .: 94.50
<S> come hither , i say , and don t be afraid , continued athos .: 18.33
<S> but amid all this he perceived , with a feeling of real joy , that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor mme .: 64.56
<S> in his eyes and to his conviction , mme .: 43.08
<S> my orders ? asked grimaud .: 27.77
<S> recollect , our only desire is to carry out , in a fitting manner , the last wishes of our friend .: 125.98
<S> you have a calm , strong mind , maximilian .: 41.82
<S> ah and as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan .: 139.46
<S> monseigneur , your eminence is a hundred times too kind to me ; and on the contrary , i think i have not proved myself worthy of your goodness .: 36.12
<S> do you recollect the words in which the information against you was <UNK> ? oh yes , i read it over three times , and the words sank deeply into my memory . repeat it to me . dante s paused a moment , then said , this is it , word for word : the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion , that one edmond dante s , mate on board the pharaon , this day arrived from smyrna , after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo , has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper ; again , by the usurper , with a letter for the bonapartist club in paris .: 67.37
<S> that s it !: 16.35
<S> decidedly , said danglars , with the perspiration on his forehead , i must be under arrest . and he threw himself back in the calash , not this time to sleep , but to think .: 46.20
<S> fly , friends , fly ! he added , <UNK> his sword around him .: 95.78
<S> but , d artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him .: 57.14
<S> danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dante s ; and , when napoleon returned to france , he , after the manner of <UNK> minds , termed the coincidence , a decree of providence .: 122.53
<S> do you take any interest in politics ? a gleam of light shone in aramis s eyes , as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face , but not so brief but that it was seen by d artagnan .: 51.16
<S> it matters little now to me .: 102.26
<S> besides , make yourselves easy ; we shall not all arrive at london . why so ? because , in all probability , some one of us will be left on the road . is this , then , a campaign upon which we are now entering ? one of a most dangerous kind , i give you notice . ah !: 53.50
<S> you ll excuse me , i know . they exchanged bows and d artagnan returned to his companions .: 64.69
<S> the valet opened the door , and villefort heard someone speak his name .: 38.56
<S> i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew .: 79.92
<S> rare birds , retaining their most brilliant <UNK> , enormous fish , spread upon massive silver dishes , together with every wine produced in the archipelago , <UNK> minor , or the cape , sparkling in bottles , whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught , all these , like one of the <UNK> with which <UNK> of old gratified his guests , passed in review before the eyes of the astonished parisians , who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons , but only on the condition of eating pearls , like cleopatra , or drinking refined gold , like <UNK> de medici .: 316.98
<S> there he found everything arranged in due order , the accusation , examination , morrel s petition , m. de villefort s marginal notes .: 261.83
<S> they were thus perpetually employed , faria , that he might not see himself grow old ; dante s , for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night .: 250.49
<S> let us hope , my child , cried the marquis , that m. de villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province ; if so , he will have achieved a noble work . and one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father s conduct , added the incorrigible marquise .: 80.43
<S> she who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors .: 116.13
<S> i am an officer of fortune , nothing else ; i have nothing but what my sword brings me in that is to say , more blows than banknotes .: 70.74
<S> afraid of making any inquiries at this house , d artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of <UNK> .: 71.52
<S> it was brought to me .: 24.12
<S> there are in <UNK> a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty .: 520.20
<S> unquestionably , edmond s star is in the <UNK> , and he will marry the splendid girl he will be captain , too , and laugh at us all , unless a sinister smile passed over danglars lips unless i take a hand in the affair , he added .: 170.23
<S> bertuccio remained standing before him .: 29.08
<S> d artagnan s friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay , but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract .: 45.61
<S> after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented , but had been merely placed one upon the other , and covered with stucco ; he inserted the point of his pickaxe , and using the handle as a lever , with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges , and fall at his feet .: 124.06
<S> he was <UNK> surprised to see his own valet de chambre , whom he had not brought , that he might not inconvenience monte cristo .: 62.90
<S> we can wait the more contentedly , that it is not absolutely bad here , but for one thing , at least . what is that ? did you observe , d artagnan , that three days running they have brought us <UNK> mutton ? no ; but if it occurs a fourth time i shall complain of it , so never mind . and then i feel the loss of my house , tis a long time since i visited my castles . forget them for a time ; we shall return to them , unless mazarin <UNK> them to the ground . do you think that likely ? no , the other cardinal would have done so , but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it . you reconcile me , d artagnan . well , then , assume a cheerful manner , as i do ; we must joke with the guards , we must gain the good will of the soldiers , since we can t corrupt them .: 78.89
<S> on the other hand , he was about to land , without any other escort than these men , on an island which had , indeed , a very religious name , but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality , thanks to the smugglers and bandits .: 72.87
<S> at this moment my mother seized me in her arms , and hurrying noiselessly along numerous <UNK> and windings known only to ourselves , she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk , where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion .: 181.40
<S> but he did not succeed .: 19.19
<S> it was now a third full , just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes .: 54.18
<S> i will do as children do , for fear of losing the paper repeat the name along the route .: 164.77
<S> his task was the more difficult , as there was no board to support him .: 65.29
<S> the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four companions .: 58.58
