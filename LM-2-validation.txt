<S> i find england a charming country , and i stay but on one condition only . what is it ? that i am not forced to learn english . well , now , said athos , triumphantly , i swear to you , my friend , by the god who hears us i believe that there is a power watching over us , and that we shall all four see france again . so be it ! said d artagnan , but i i confess i have a contrary conviction . our good d artagnan , said aramis , represents among us the opposition in parliament , which always says no , and always does <UNK> . but in the meantime <UNK> the country , added athos .: 82.47
<S> it is you , monsieur d artagnan , she said , smiling graciously ; i thank you for having insisted on seeing me . i ought to ask your majesty s pardon , but i wished to receive your commands from your own mouth . do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you ? with gratitude . very well , be here at midnight . i will not fail . monsieur d artagnan , continued the queen , i know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment , but i swear to you that i shall not forget this second service as i forgot the first . your majesty is free to forget or to remember , as it pleases you ; and i know not what you mean , said d artagnan , bowing .: 38.10
<S> take courage , sir ; but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude . ah , here is m. dandre ! cried de blacas .: 55.81
<S> villefort s first impression was favorable ; but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses , that he applied the maxim to the impression , forgetting the difference between the two words .: 147.18
<S> it s little enough . but so it is . no , it can not be ! are you my friend , caderousse ? yes , in life or death . well , i will tell you a secret . what is it ? but remember ah !: 35.47
<S> let this affair be talked of , it will be a triumph for them , which will make them rejoice , and cover me with shame .: 86.84
<S> your pardon , m. morrel , said dante s , approaching , the vessel now rides at anchor , and i am at your service .: 46.70
<S> nor , although preceding the party , did he once mistake one door for another , or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit .: 510.99
<S> as long as your brother was with me he kept me up ; but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself , either to me or to your father .: 57.90
<S> do you fear he will not understand ? yes . oh , we have so often spoken of you , that he knows exactly how i talk to you . then turning to maximilian , with an adorable smile ; although shaded by sorrow , he knows everything i know , said she .: 52.33
<S> the <UNK> of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many colored scarves , whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of parisian belles .: 237.39
<S> haitians are the e carte of french stock jobbing .: 3002.40
<S> you may make your mind easy , said the doctor ; he is dead .: 22.90
<S> say so at once ; we are sufficiently well bred to excuse you , and to listen to your history , fabulous as it promises to be . and i say to you , fabulous as it may seem , i tell it as a true one from beginning to end .: 103.72
<S> they are yours ; take them . mordaunt , delighted , advanced , porthos looking at d artagnan with open mouthed astonishment .: 80.65
<S> come in , gentlemen , repeated the princess , opening the door herself .: 36.06
<S> yes , athos , you may laugh , but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us . but , said porthos , with great wisdom , that was impossible , for they would have killed the captain and the sailors . bah !: 67.82
<S> the musketeers trotted up , and at the same time the ten men whom d artagnan had given to comminges appeared .: 41.27
<S> have you never heard what oliver cromwell said when he came to paris and was shown the dungeon at vincennes where monsieur de vendome was imprisoned ? what did he say ? asked porthos .: 60.08
<S> morbleu ! you must know something about it .: 24.74
<S> only , might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made ?: 566.25
<S> m. danglars was out , but the count was asked to go and see the baroness , and he accepted the invitation .: 44.97
<S> no , d artagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time .: 132.92
<S> you will not abandon me !: 16.06
<S> m. and mme .: 38.86
<S> i was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away , i suppose to the spaniards ; there s no use in thinking any more about athos .: 103.87
<S> bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions ; but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class , and d artagnan was a gentleman .: 107.66
<S> cromwell s letter .: 93.16
<S> the garden became darker still , but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress , and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps .: 88.02
<S> have you not slept ? said the jailer .: 23.89
<S> our cargo was to be landed in the gulf of lyons , and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year 1829 .: 90.82
<S> these two men , thus opposed in age and interests , resembled two parts of a triangle , presenting the <UNK> of separation , yet nevertheless possessing their point of union .: 354.92
<S> the day passed away as rapidly as an hour .: 26.30
<S> on the contrary , replied aramis , your opinion will be very valuable .: 20.31
<S> today is the twentieth of september .: 50.92
<S> his disposition always inclined to exact <UNK> rather than to make them kept him <UNK> from all friendships .: 766.04
<S> valentine rushed towards him ; his lips again moved .: 48.57
<S> his face was livid , large drops rolled down his face , and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms .: 70.75
<S> he called it using his advantages .: 194.34
<S> good night , my friends .: 38.63
<S> d artagnan bent forward , ready either to attack or to stand on his defense .: 107.27
<S> you think i shall deprive you of those three millions , said danglars ; but do not fear it .: 32.17
<S> a man of spirit is not to be reminded of such services .: 63.11
<S> well , while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk .: 66.29
<S> she is speaking , said porthos ; i think she wants to ride on horseback . oh , she would like it , but but what ? the cardinal won t allow it .: 67.56
<S> i swear to you , you shall receive the consolation that you ask .: 38.76
<S> i come to you , my leader , my head , my father , and i ask you , master , are you contented with me ? cromwell looked at him with astonishment .: 25.92
<S> my honor will not survive it !: 51.76
<S> i believe with your majesty that monsieur de tre ville s guarantee is more than sufficient . tre ville bowed very respectfully , with a joy that was not <UNK> with fear ; he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of the cardinal to this sudden yielding .: 84.26
<S> there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg electronic works .: 25.38
<S> rather , place faith in what i tell you .: 157.73
<S> i only know it says , thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s goods , nor yet his wife . that is a child s reason , monsieur blaisois , said mousqueton in his most patronizing manner .: 121.34
<S> fine spoil , captain , fine spoil ! said peppino in italian , and taking danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door , through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling place .: 127.48
<S> count , she said , bragelonne must be a charming place .: 49.38
<S> why do you remember when it forgets ?: 107.05
<S> as the count s title sounded on his ear he rose , and addressing his colleagues , who were members of one or the other chamber , he said : gentlemen , pardon me for leaving you so abruptly ; but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred , which is this , thomson french , the roman bankers , have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo , and have given him an unlimited credit with me .: 94.99
<S> grimaud made a sign in the affirmative .: 14.06
<S> in <UNK> he was supposed to be slain in winter with the decay of vegetation and to revive in the spring .: 238.64
<S> she had , in her first marriage i don t think , d artagnan , i am telling you anything new married a lawyer ; they thought that nauseous ; you can understand that s a word bad enough to make one kill thirty thousand men .: 143.23
<S> but he does wrong to use his privilege .: 137.34
<S> to a look of interrogation which they made , milady replied by a sign that it was he .: 52.33
<S> you know he has estates porthos ? i should think so , indeed .: 54.82
<S> athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing .: 62.99
<S> from a distance they perceived aramis , seated in a melancholy manner at his window , looking out , like sister anne , at the dust in the horizon .: 76.64
<S> albert found in his anteroom two guns , with all the accoutrements for hunting ; a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the english eminent in <UNK> pursuits , since they are patient and sluggish have invented for fishing .: 578.69
<S> who can tell whether mazarin may not take advantage of this rendezvous to seize us ? what !: 90.19
<S> the park is twenty acres twenty , <UNK> kitchen gardens and a common .: 515.49
<S> the anjou wine after the most disheartening news of the king s health , a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp ; and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege , it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward .: 76.62
<S> hastily raising myself on one arm , i looked around , but all was dark ; and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above , for some kind of moisture appeared to fall , drop by drop , upon my forehead , and when i passed my hand across my brow , i felt that it was wet and <UNK> .: 73.99
<S> come !: 17.12
<S> well , then , the frenchman took off his mask ; teresa , with the chief s consent , did the same .: 34.04
<S> go out by the door , turn to the right , jump into your saddles , all will be right ; don t be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal .: 68.67
<S> oh , i am dying ! he again fainted .: 20.02
<S> as he had seen milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving england , he suspected that it was , almost without a doubt , on account of the diamond studs .: 56.73
<S> both were men of courage and honor ; and as m. de la tre mouille a protestant , and seeing the king seldom was of no party , he did not , in general , carry any bias into his social relations .: 113.36
<S> you will not accept my gold ; i will keep it for myself .: 36.22
<S> god will punish you !: 48.28
<S> another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in madame de villefort s bedroom .: 71.95
<S> that s another thing , said d artagnan , and i should not mind waiting in london a whole year for a chance of meeting this mordaunt in question .: 71.57
<S> they withdrew to a private house , and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety , they occupied but one room and provided an exit , which might be useful in case of an attack .: 114.56
<S> well , suppose i go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find , even into the <UNK> ?: 121.30
<S> good news !: 61.99
<S> as villefort observes , it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica , where he was born , and naples , of which his brother in law is king , and face to face with italy , the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son . unfortunately , said villefort , there are the treaties of 1814 , and we can not <UNK> napoleon without breaking those <UNK> . oh , well , we shall find some way out of it , responded m. de salvieux .: 79.02
<S> but he was not listened to , and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the spaniards .: 73.26
<S> they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica , whose mountains appeared against the sky , showing their <UNK> <UNK> in bold relief ; this mass of rock , like the giant <UNK> , rose dead ahead , a formidable barrier , and <UNK> the light that gilded its massive <UNK> so that the voyagers were in shadow .: 348.22
<S> at this spot , so <UNK> with fond and filial remembrances , his heart beat almost to bursting , his knees tottered under him , a mist floated over his sight , and had he not clung for support to one of the trees , he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many <UNK> continually passing there .: 182.88
<S> d artagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred ; the dogs became in their turn silent .: 91.81
<S> a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage , and which , while it covered morcerf and his two companions with dust , pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins , incited him to join in the general combat , in which all the masks around him were engaged .: 140.01
<S> the intrepid treasure seeker walked round it , and , selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack , placed his lever in one of the crevices , and strained every nerve to move the mass .: 221.86
<S> d artagnan turned , mechanically looking behind him , and between the figures of two soldiers he could see parry standing up and charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to god .: 142.26
<S> i must obey you , though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the water . hope , my friend , repeated the count .: 70.98
<S> the foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall back .: 179.61
<S> pretend to sleep , louis , said she .: 59.41
<S> the old man listened attentively , making a sign only that it was all so ; and then , when d artagnan had ended , he shook his head with an air that announced nothing good .: 42.76
<S> it might alienate my protector .: 313.47
<S> the count of monte cristo , continued the servant , begs these gentlemen s permission to wait upon them as their neighbor , and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him . faith , franz , whispered albert , there is not much to find fault with here . tell the count , replied franz , that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him . the servant bowed and retired .: 52.77
<S> a firm and well <UNK> hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond .: 145.05
<S> not a step forward , or you re dead men . stuff ! cried porthos , almost choked with dust and <UNK> his bridle as a horse <UNK> his bit .: 215.98
<S> what papers ? the certificate of your marriage with oliva corsinari , and the register of your child s birth . the register of my child s birth ? the register of the birth of andrea cavalcanti of your son ; is not his name andrea ? i believe so , said the major .: 93.50
<S> notwithstanding his shattered nerves , the ringing sensation in his ears , and the madness which turned his brain , villefort rose as he perceived her .: 126.86
<S> punctuality , said monte cristo , is the politeness of kings , according to one of your sovereigns , i think ; but it is not the same with travellers .: 47.88
<S> he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards .: 365.56
<S> with two companions ? he said .: 29.93
<S> d artagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan , of which we shall hereafter see the execution , and which promised him some agreeable adventure , as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance , whose thoughtfulness they animated .: 97.75
<S> chanleu , whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment , thought that the moment was come to pursue it ; but it was <UNK> and led again to the charge by the duc de chatillon in person .: 109.35
<S> it appears that messieurs the musketeers keep guard , said he .: 147.69
<S> and now , he said , may i inquire what are the orders with which your majesty <UNK> to honor me ? take what rest you require , and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in paris , you may be of the greatest service to me at marseilles . sire , replied villefort , bowing , in an hour i shall have quitted paris . go , sir , said the king ; and should i forget you kings memories are short , do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection .: 50.89
<S> it is only for a moment and i know that i belong to you ; but remember that you are not to strike till i give the signal . then he knelt down , made the sign of the cross , and lowering his face to the planks , as if he would have kissed them , said in a low tone , in french , comte de la fere , are you there ? yes , your majesty , he answered , trembling .: 34.65
<S> <UNK> !: 469.88
<S> but to her great surprise d artagnan remained perfectly calm , and instead of being angry he laughed , and said to porthos : yes , i understand , the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds ; but console yourself , i will soon conduct you to one much better . when will you do that ? immediately , i hope . ah !: 65.16
<S> a thousand francs . but whence have you obtained them ? listen to me , mother , and do not yield too much to agitation . and albert , rising , kissed his mother on both cheeks , then stood looking at her .: 82.15
<S> the silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk , and d artagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand , which , by its form , its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss .: 93.73
<S> i have not , and i can not make three copies of that letter , because it is sealed .: 35.84
<S> they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret , left bazin with him , who , besides , in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful , and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens .: 78.39
<S> morrel rose tremblingly , supporting himself by the arm of the chair .: 69.15
<S> i am finishing the most execrable morning s work . what is it ? said albert ; arranging your papers , apparently . my papers , thank god , no , my papers are all in capital order , because i have none ; but m. cavalcanti s. m .: 112.95
<S> i must have lost it , said the young man maliciously , pretending to search for it .: 53.34
<S> nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends ; and i know one down there behind the saint nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it . merce de s ? said the old man .: 90.78
<S> by denying all , it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow ; by confessing all he might prove his good will .: 158.77
<S> the sea is the cemetery of the cha teau d if .: 12.76
<S> you see it makes a very respectable appearance . pardieu , cried d artagnan , it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinal s money ! you are an amiable and charming young man , said mme .: 52.12
<S> they are soldiers , though , resumed de bragelonne .: 76.72
<S> franz hastened to inquire after the count , and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time ; but pastrini reassured him by saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself , and that it had gone at four o clock to fetch him from the rospoli palace .: 44.95
<S> the abbe busoni had watched till daylight , and then left without calling anyone .: 79.51
<S> i did not know , when i came with such haste to you , that i was to meet an enemy here . an enemy ! cried merce de s , with an angry look at her cousin .: 36.17
<S> the house in which aramis dwelt was situated between the rue cassette and the rue servandoni .: 76.74
<S> i wish , continued mazarin , finishing , as it were , the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut ; i wish , in fact , that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover . again that accusation ! cried the queen .: 91.65
<S> to maintain a cause which i believed sacred i have lost the throne and my children their inheritance .: 226.80
<S> no ; that is sufficient ; a man can pass through that . porthos tried , and passed the upper portion of his body through .: 60.30
<S> then by degrees the reality broke upon me , full of chaste terrors .: 245.37
<S> the countess de winter as they rode along , the duke endeavored to draw from d artagnan , not all that had happened , but what d artagnan himself knew .: 56.19
<S> are you no longer my master , or have i ceased to be your slave ? monte cristo returned her smile .: 39.02
<S> that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost , like a <UNK> .: 338.55
<S> i lost a battle in spain , i have been defeated in trieste , but my naval army in india will have taken some <UNK> , and my <UNK> pioneers will have discovered some mine . very good , very good !: 149.10
<S> madame , said he , i bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the count de guiche , who told me he had the honor of being your servant ; this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect . at the name of the count de guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity .: 38.17
<S> from a distance resounded , deadened , however , by good shutters , the songs of the <UNK> , enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain .: 153.59
<S> the host shook his head .: 11.19
<S> you are about to see , said mousqueton , looking at blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning , you are about to see , blaisois , how we old soldiers drink when we are thirsty . my cloak , said grimaud , from the bottom of the hold .: 65.69
<S> the guide took them , thinking them merely a few pieces of little value ; but the light of the torch revealed their true worth .: 135.19
<S> myriads of hoarse cries , forming one vast uproar , were heard , mingled with guns firing .: 800.78
<S> the reason of it was , that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret , and begged me not to tell you anything of it .: 44.58
<S> the king took advantage of this favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly giving a fe te .: 75.83
<S> and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence ? continued the mercer , with a trifling alteration in his voice so trifling , indeed , that d artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which , an instant before , had darkened the countenance of the worthy man .: 88.94
<S> a sort of book , written upon strips of cloth . go and fetch it , my good fellow ; and if it be what i hope , you will do well . i will run for it , sir ; and the guide went out .: 45.19
<S> besides , he had another strange fancy , which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of others .: 78.19
<S> really , he is by no means a light load ! said the other bearer , sitting on the edge of the hand <UNK> .: 96.57
<S> it is a fine thing to have such credit ; really , it is only in france these things are done .: 42.26
<S> it is not natural for letters to enter people s houses in this manner .: 94.97
<S> you were recommended to monsieur de tre ville , were you not ? yes , monseigneur ; but in that unfortunate affair at meung the letter was lost , replied his eminence ; yes , i know that .: 30.10
<S> bernouin ! bernouin entered .: 130.68
<S> well , asked he of the count , what has , then , happened ? nothing , replied the count ; only , as you see , the carnival has commenced .: 31.30
<S> what is to be done ? asked d artagnan .: 5.13
<S> you do not know my mother ; she it is whom you see here .: 48.49
<S> had morrel been a more quick sighted man , or better versed in these matters , he would have been surprised at the king s procureur answering him on such a subject , instead of referring him to the <UNK> of the prison or the prefect of the department .: 127.42
<S> and what did the <UNK> <UNK> say about me ? i admit the word , monseigneur , because it <UNK> with <UNK> minister .: 277.52
<S> the beggar of st. eustache .: 30.69
<S> a nightly patrol .: 158.19
<S> meanwhile madame danglars , veiled and uneasy , awaited the return of debray in the little green room , seated between two baskets of flowers , which she had that morning sent , and which , it must be confessed , debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman .: 93.32
<S> i have written a letter today ; that letter is not yet gone .: 59.32
<S> danglars listened with the most profound attention ; he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days , and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to morcerf .: 61.63
<S> that is to say , athos will be chief <UNK> , porthos purveyor in general , and aramis governor of the fortress . meanwhile , they gave up to mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau .: 152.60
<S> tis easy to say so , but that requires money , and i haven t any . ah ! replied mazarin , so you have no money ? none , my lord . but the diamond i gave you yesterday ? i wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence . mazarin sighed .: 46.07
<S> la carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband , but as he made no sign of changing his position , she extended her hard , bony hand , and touched him on the forehead .: 59.68
<S> we have arranged the ransom of each of them 2,000 on arriving in france .: 93.51
<S> this man had seen valentine , and spoken to her !: 53.74
<S> let us leave them , she said .: 12.07
<S> i understand why you accepted it , and i grant you my pardon ; but upon one condition . what is that ? said the soldier , uneasy at perceiving that all was not over .: 63.52
<S> it would require years to do again what i have done here , and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other .: 163.36
<S> those imbeciles of <UNK> can only imagine things to torment honest people . and what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence ? that if the astrologer in question made <UNK> i would advise him not to buy one . why not ? because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird . unfortunately , that is true .: 193.04
<S> stop !: 27.26
<S> dante s , repeated he , edmond dante s. yes , monsieur . villefort opened a large register , then went to a table , from the table turned to his <UNK> , and then , turning to morrel , are you quite sure you are not mistaken , monsieur ? said he , in the most natural tone in the world .: 38.81
<S> long life to the great cardinal ! the cardinal listened with a smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of m. bonacieux ; and then , when bonacieux s cries were no longer audible , good ! said he , that man would henceforward lay down his life for me . and the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of la rochelle , which , as we have said , lay open on the desk , tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which , eighteen months later , shut up the port of the besieged city .: 101.48
<S> well , have you tied the knot ? inquired the grave digger , who was looking on .: 71.71
<S> among the groups which <UNK> towards the family vault , cha teau renaud recognized morrel , who had come alone in a cabriolet , and walked silently along the path bordered with yew trees .: 153.34
<S> mme .: 13.89
<S> and have i any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there ?: 128.08
<S> the story of <UNK> , maximilian , is not a fable , but an <UNK> . when do you leave ? immediately ; the steamer waits , and in an hour i shall be far from you .: 77.39
<S> a second hearse , decked with the same funereal pomp , was brought to m. de villefort s door , and the coffin removed into it from the post wagon .: 147.20
<S> you will find me ready to follow you . they took leave of each other , and in ten minutes , after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin , d artagnan was <UNK> along in the direction of amiens .: 40.57
<S> but what is this that i hear from her majesty the queen of england ?: 28.23
<S> oh , it concerns you very closely , my uncle , i am sure , and you will soon be of my opinion , added he , with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed .: 37.30
<S> it is to pass the carnival at venice ; there we are sure of obtaining <UNK> if we can not have carriages . ah , the devil , no , cried albert ; i came to rome to see the carnival , and i will , though i see it on <UNK> . bravo !: 84.09
<S> to day i am engaged in a different affair .: 37.21
<S> very well until the moment when the comte de la fere , resumed raoul , said , come , bragelonne , draw your sword ; then only i rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two , just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing , ere it sprang upon me .: 99.65
<S> the agent arose , and having bowed to lord wilmore , who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english , he retired .: 70.27
<S> she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of thomson french had come to her father s , related the scene on the staircase , repeated the promise she had made , and showed him the letter .: 55.54
<S> albert entered .: 25.43
<S> do you know what they are saying here ? no , your eminence . well , they say that monsieur de beaufort is going to escape from vincennes , if he has not done so already . the officer s face expressed complete stupefaction .: 43.07
<S> sir , he cried , scarcely able to believe his good fortune sir , i can not understand your generosity ! oh , it is very simple , my good fellow ; i have been a sailor , and your story touched me more than it would others . then , sir , since you are so liberal , i ought to offer you something . <UNK> what have you to offer to me , my friend ?: 46.71
<S> both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse .: 107.91
<S> speak , gentlemen , speak i am listening ; conceal nothing , <UNK> over nothing .: 130.60
<S> you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg works .: 23.92
<S> above you there is the king ; above the king there is god ! however perfect master he was over himself , my persecutor allowed a movement of anger to escape him .: 221.32
<S> have you a good horse , monsieur de bragelonne ? my horse was killed this morning , my lord , and i am mounted provisionally on my lackey s. choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best .: 82.03
<S> pardieu ! and what do they say of it in the world ? in which world ?: 36.93
<S> this time it was not a wandering troop of partisans ; it was an entire army .: 61.46
<S> yes , yes , said milady ; the letter is precise .: 25.73
<S> there is now a truce and a conference .: 58.61
<S> but wait .: 61.26
<S> really , said d artagnan , these people are very ingenious .: 25.85
<S> adapt your promises to their respective characters . what shall i promise ? that if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be magnificent . but what are we to do ? make your mind easy ; when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what i require from you ; wait till that time arrives and find out your friends . my lord , perhaps they are not in paris .: 93.67
<S> duke , you already know that it is not i who caused you to be written to . yes , yes , madame !: 36.86
<S> they ask where i was born ; i answer .: 57.41
<S> the bandits shouted with laughter .: 174.01
<S> signor pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor , which he offered at the low charge of a louis per <UNK> .: 94.49
<S> it is his son ! d artagnan s arm dropped to his side .: 29.52
<S> d artagnan was a physiognomist .: 20.34
<S> milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon , and lord de winter would redouble his watch .: 104.64
<S> this morning he made two or three <UNK> worthy of <UNK> or anthony . at this moment a fresh visitor entered , and , according to custom , franz gave up his seat to him .: 108.81
<S> albert , too , was ill at ease ; the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position .: 147.21
<S> i have heard , said blaisois , that port is a very good wine . excellent ! exclaimed mousqueton , smacking his lips .: 47.14
<S> death to the guards !: 85.94
<S> the part of an honest man , full of courage and real regard .: 50.66
<S> morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son , of whose arrival he was ignorant .: 21.94
<S> the duchess is at tours , and the duke at boulogne .: 30.11
<S> your arrest is known , that of your friends will soon be known ; and all the nobility of france would demand an explanation of your disappearance .: 79.97
<S> there still remained planchet s horse ; but he stopped short , and could not be made to move a step .: 51.15
<S> i believe so , replied the secretary with slight uneasiness .: 33.63
<S> if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook , complying with the trademark license is very easy .: 26.06
<S> help me out of paris ; help me out of france ! i can not take you , however , to the siege of la rochelle , said d artagnan .: 28.09
<S> well , if so , why do you object to my doing so ? i do not say that you ought not to fight , i only say that a duel is a serious thing , and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection . did he reflect before he insulted my father ? if he spoke hastily , and owns that he did so , you ought to be satisfied . ah , my dear count , you are far too indulgent . and you are far too exacting .: 54.93
<S> remember his name well and look at him well , that his face may not be forgotten , for this evening he is going to render us a great service . the young king looked at the officer with his large formed eye , and repeated : monsieur d artagnan . that is it , my son . the young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer ; the latter bent on his knee and kissed it .: 46.47
<S> still the walls seemed to be closing on him ; they appeared to be in concert with his enemies .: 61.37
<S> rest assured , we shall not see her . and you say that we are going from here to the palais royal ? immediately .: 28.21
<S> i think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other chastisement . who told you that i loved him ? asked milady , sharply .: 49.24
<S> can he be afraid of this boy ? but an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short ; he bowed humbly and retired .: 115.32
<S> alas , alas !: 19.25
<S> who are these gentleman ? three of the king s musketeers .: 37.60
<S> come my brother , go with me , added d artagnan , and i will see that you are made a duke ! no , answered porthos , mouston has no desire to fight ; besides , they have erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony , which will kill my neighbors with envy . to that i can say nothing , returned d artagnan , who knew the vanity of the new baron .: 63.83
<S> do you wish me , for instance , to give information to the procureur ? monte cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that morrel , starting up , cried out : you know of whom i speak , count , do you not ? perfectly well , my good friend ; and i will prove it to you by putting the <UNK> to the i , or rather by naming the persons .: 45.25
<S> believe me guilty as i was oh , yes , i , too , have suffered much ! have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence ? cried monte cristo , thrusting his hands into his hair ; have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival , while you were <UNK> at the bottom of a dungeon ? no , interrupted merce de s , but i have seen him whom i loved on the point of murdering my son . merce de s uttered these words with such deep anguish , with an accent of such intense despair , that monte cristo could not restrain a sob .: 45.39
<S> he insisted on being introduced , saying that although he was not a deputy from monsieur de conti , or monsieur de beaufort , or monsieur de bouillon , or monsieur d elbeuf , or the coadjutor , or madame de longueville , or broussel , or the parliament , and although he had come on his own private account , he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance .: 51.67
<S> the young man turned round , thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him , and had returned just as they were starting .: 47.96
<S> just god ! he muttered , whence comes this thought ?: 123.53
<S> i am brutal , i not only allow it , but boast of it ; it is one of the reasons of my success in commercial business .: 77.83
<S> the door closed ; but this time a fresh <UNK> was left with dante s hope .: 55.00
<S> she cast her eyes upon the table , saw the glittering of a knife , rushed toward it and clutched it ; but her disappointment was cruel .: 72.38
<S> how many men , think you , you could collect together to night ? two hundred muskets and five hundred halberds . let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by to morrow we shall have quite a powerful army .: 168.40
<S> give me the pocket book , la carconte , and find a bag somewhere . la carconte went to a cupboard , and returned with an old leathern pocket book and a bag .: 82.67
<S> but consider , d artagnan , added he , in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder , consider that be thune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who , wherever she goes , brings misery with her .: 82.03
<S> the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread ; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table .: 41.96
<S> oh , look at me closely , and discover , if you can , even the semblance of a reproach in me . the count looked up and fixed his eyes on merce de s , who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him .: 52.68
<S> as for me , my heart is overflowing with happiness . happy father , happy son ! said the count .: 50.66
<S> this personage was m. bonacieux , the respectable martyr of the political and amorous intrigues which <UNK> themselves so nicely together at this gallant and chivalric period .: 420.82
<S> for instance , there is apoplexy that lightning stroke which strikes but does not destroy you , and yet which brings everything to an end .: 158.32
<S> a worthy man , who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting his mistress married , and securing her a position .: 70.13
<S> as for what you do me the honor to say , i presume you mean i was afraid ? the queen smiled .: 32.41
<S> he received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton <UNK> in the other .: 131.11
<S> bring here immediately the king s attorney , m. de villefort , who lives in the faubourg saint honore .: 32.64
<S> d artagnan was secretly touched with remorse , not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in <UNK> , for porthos , in the title of baron , had his object and reward ; but poor mousqueton , whose only wish was to be called mouston was it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was ?: 178.95
<S> but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me , added he , drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies , i shall endeavor to correct his mistake . what happened during the night ? asked beauchamp of cha teau renaud ; we appear to make a very sorry figure here . in truth , what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble , replied the baron .: 84.16
<S> d artagnan , although he was not a musketeer , performed the duty of one with remarkable punctuality .: 68.87
<S> back already !: 990.54
<S> come , athos ! said d artagnan , giving his hand to the count ; you are going to see something curious , added the gascon .: 14.93
<S> speak one word , madame , and i take upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy . at the first word milady turned , looking at the young man with astonishment ; and when he had finished , she said in very good french , monsieur , i should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom i quarrel were not my brother . ah , excuse me , then , said d artagnan .: 52.84
<S> we must explain this visit , which although expected by monte cristo , is unexpected to our readers .: 68.27
<S> they needed breakfast , and alighted at the door of an <UNK> , recommended by a sign representing st. martin giving half his cloak to a poor man .: 228.92
<S> this answer , and especially the tone in which it was uttered , chilled the heart of poor morrel .: 89.91
<S> let us see , said athos .: 6.10
<S> he passed them , then returned so as to meet them exactly before the samaritaine , which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the bridge .: 98.72
<S> i love <UNK> and silence , because i can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days .: 142.31
<S> when he was completely dressed he said : send hither monsieur d artagnan . the valet went out of the room , this time by the centre door , but still as silently as before ; one might have fancied him an apparition .: 63.92
<S> felton , abandon me !: 81.29
<S> all four once more together .: 107.95
<S> but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments , qu <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .: 320.11
<S> is it not so ? certainly ; but if you love me as much as you say , replied d artagnan , do you not entertain a little fear on my account ? what have i to fear ? why , that i may be dangerously wounded killed even . impossible ! cried milady , you are such a valiant man , and such an expert swordsman . you would not , then , prefer a method , resumed d artagnan , which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless ? milady looked at her lover in silence .: 62.45
<S> monte cristo seemed in despair .: 30.31
<S> i have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head , that i am become passive in the hands of the almighty , like a sparrow in the <UNK> of an eagle .: 80.20
<S> i can not have deceived myself , he said ; i must look upon the past in a false light .: 33.89
<S> oh , your great work on the monarchy of italy ! faria then drew forth from his hiding place three or four rolls of linen , laid one over the other , like folds of <UNK> .: 162.73
<S> bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically , and just touched the glass with her lips .: 76.04
<S> sir , said milady , is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity ?: 97.22
<S> you had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to death . oh , dear , no , your excellency , unless you intend to commit suicide .: 81.65
<S> that is because love has come suddenly upon me , and for the first time ; and because i am only twenty . the young woman looked at him furtively .: 54.24
<S> pray tell me what you think , baron , for i feel uneasy , i can assure you , having some considerable property in their hands . thomson french are perfectly <UNK> , replied danglars , with an almost mocking smile ; but the word unlimited , in financial affairs , is so extremely vague . is , in fact , unlimited , said monte cristo .: 87.26
<S> athos was right .: 20.78
<S> yes , i understand , was the reply contained in his look ; and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation , mixed with profound contempt .: 74.24
<S> there was no fear of her falling asleep .: 56.28
<S> we shall descend by the first window in the gallery . what next ? sign your name , my lord . the duke signed .: 43.72
<S> one of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there .: 68.43
<S> and thou hast not <UNK> thy thunder at him , my god !: 237.95
<S> are they spanish , haitian , or neapolitan bonds ? said monte cristo .: 122.96
<S> at first , indeed , they were doubtful whether the king s visit to the parliament had been in order to <UNK> or increase their burdens ; but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased , when cries of down with mazarin ! long live broussel ! long live blancmesnil ! resounded through the city .: 155.65
<S> most likely , said d artagnan ; i am one of his most faithful servants . it appears that his eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to england ? yes ; a certain d artagnan , a be arnese gentleman who left paris in company with three of his friends , with the intention of going to london . do you know him personally ? asked the governor .: 52.89
<S> aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant <UNK> . he cast his eyes again on the letter .: 138.75
<S> it is he whom we must warn .: 53.06
<S> the treasure of the spadas exists .: 125.69
<S> gentlemen , said he , m .: 10.82
<S> where are you going ? cried the young girl , extending her hand through the opening , and seizing maximilian by his coat , for she understood from her own agitated feelings that her lover s calmness could not be real ; where are you going ? i am going , that i may not bring fresh trouble into your family : and to set an example which every honest and devoted man , situated as i am , may follow . before you leave me , tell me what you are going to do , maximilian . the young man smiled sorrowfully .: 60.14
<S> not more than five or six hundred thousand francs , said lord wilmore ; he is a miser . hatred evidently inspired the englishman , who , knowing no other reproach to bring on the count , accused him of avarice .: 87.80
<S> listen , beauchamp !: 35.12
<S> besides , his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh , but that is dreadful !: 127.14
<S> what are my commands ? said the queen .: 14.51
<S> suddenly we heard loud cries ; and , listening , discerned that they were cries of joy .: 141.70
<S> i have a despatch from the prince to his eminence . you must still deliver it , said athos .: 42.08
<S> then listen , said he .: 17.68
<S> de guiche , as we have said before , had been educated at the court , and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him .: 31.20
<S> as fast as they entered , they were placed in the grand saloon , on the <UNK> prepared for them .: 72.50
<S> athos , assisted by porthos , who lifted him up like a feather , arrived at the top .: 43.25
<S> baptistin , said the count , have the other fish brought in the sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks , and which are yet alive . danglars opened his bewildered eyes ; the company clapped their hands .: 125.01
<S> so much the worse , and so much the better ! it need not be said that d artagnan was still thinking of the husband .: 19.47
<S> he could already see the <UNK> s beaming smile change to a <UNK> of grief .: 673.60
<S> and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice . thank you , no , sir . then it will be tomorrow . yes ; but without fail . ah , you are laughing at me ; send tomorrow at twelve , and the bank shall be <UNK> . i will come myself . better still , since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you . they shook hands .: 59.90
<S> at four o clock d artagnan recommenced his journey .: 29.57
<S> officer ! cried grimaud .: 41.52
<S> dante s followed him ; his features were no longer contracted , and now wore their usual expression , but there was that in his whole appearance that <UNK> one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve .: 114.84
<S> oh , if such a thought could present itself , i would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant <UNK> it . indeed , my dear friend , said m. d avrigny , i would not accuse anyone ; i speak only of an accident , you understand , of a mistake , but whether accident or mistake , the fact is there ; it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you .: 63.30
<S> this is all very easy for you to say , replied d artagnan , for you , athos , who live like a dumb man with grimaud , who forbid him to speak , and consequently never exchange ill words with him ; for you , porthos , who carry matters in such a magnificent style , and are a god to your valet , mousqueton ; and for you , aramis , who , always abstracted by your theological studies , inspire your servant , bazin , a mild , religious man , with a profound respect ; but for me , who am without any settled means and without resources for me , who am neither a musketeer nor even a guardsman , what am i to do to inspire either the affection , the terror , or the respect in planchet ? this is serious , answered the three friends ; it is a family affair .: 100.47
<S> peppino was decidedly an epicure .: 256.14
<S> he is called bragelonne .: 48.47
<S> you are saying to yourself : fifteen days , twenty days ?: 63.90
<S> <UNK> !: 469.88
<S> for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building , then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared .: 94.23
<S> a portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to moment .: 172.66
<S> good ! thought d artagnan ; a quarter of an hour to go to the tent , a quarter of an hour to return ; it is more than we need . then turning , without the least change of countenance , to porthos , he said , looking him full in the face : friend porthos , listen to this ; first , not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard ; it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them . very well ; i understand . go to the stable ; you will find mousqueton there ; saddle your horses , put your pistols in your saddle bags , take out the horses and lead them to the street below this , so that there will be nothing to do but mount them ; all the rest is my business . porthos made no remark , but obeyed , with the sublime confidence he had in his friend .: 57.69
<S> good day , monsieur d artagnan , said planchet proudly .: 22.93
<S> etiquette had no <UNK> unknown to him .: 345.70
<S> i sailed for the island of elba , where i arrived the next day ; i ordered everybody to remain on board , and went on shore alone .: 44.87
<S> while singing , milady listened .: 197.67
<S> at this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards .: 36.64
<S> that is all very well , and enough for today ; before we proceed further , someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife . but i have not told you that i know him ! cried bonacieux , in despair .: 56.59
<S> well , as you please , i even gain something by it , for i no longer see that wicked smile of yours .: 47.12
<S> d artagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task .: 115.01
<S> with a thousand pistoles one may face everything .: 124.71
<S> it was empty as yet , but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it .: 86.11
<S> a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity . it is very natural ; this island is a mass of rocks , and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation . to whom does this island belong ? to tuscany . what game shall i find there ! thousands of wild goats . who live upon the stones , i suppose , said franz with an incredulous smile .: 125.10
<S> come , answer frankly . ma foi , no , returned albert .: 40.14
<S> he then concluded it must be an assassin .: 38.70
<S> it had been said that evening a hundred times and scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject ; he was very nearly at the end of his <UNK> <UNK> , but one despairing effort saved him .: 141.80
<S> he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight , and began to view his situation more clearly .: 44.79
<S> sir , interposed blaisois , i warn you that i can only swim in rivers . and i not at all , said mousqueton .: 40.26
<S> for myself , on the other hand , my lord , returned the governor , when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my <UNK> doors i should be obliged to kill you with my own hand , since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as i am obliged to give you up , dead or alive . and once more he bowed low before his highness .: 73.94
<S> i may sacrifice my soul , but what matters it ? added monte cristo .: 57.00
<S> adieu , then , till we meet again , said valentine , tearing herself away .: 45.03
<S> yet , speaking of reports , baron , what have you learned with regard to the affair in the rue saint jacques ? the affair in the rue saint jacques ! exclaimed villefort , unable to repress an exclamation .: 52.65
<S> parbleu ! said athos .: 17.64
<S> no , said albert ; nor even ancient greek , my dear count ; never had homer or <UNK> a more unworthy <UNK> than myself . then , said hayde e , proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristo s question and albert s answer , then i will speak either in french or italian , if my lord so wills it . monte cristo reflected one instant .: 168.67
<S> if you would but accept my offers !: 106.51
<S> the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the foundation or pglaf , owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg electronic works .: 10.35
<S> he was safely sheltered , and yet he felt <UNK> in the midst of the <UNK> of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning .: 113.91
<S> the musketeer advanced two steps , and pushed d artagnan aside with his hand .: 40.36
<S> no noise from without by which i could measure the time reached me ; i only supposed it must be seven or eight o clock in the evening , for it was in the month of october and it was quite dark .: 77.01
<S> age produces good sense , and , as i doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation , i want you to tell me where he is , that he may help me to mine . rather say , to take him back with you into the world .: 80.64
<S> but don t sleep as you do all the time ; nothing <UNK> the intellect like sleep .: 210.25
<S> bonacieux , he will rouse the whole quarter . bonacieux called a long time ; but as such cries , on account of their <UNK> , brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs , and as lately the mercer s house had a bad name , finding that nobody came , he went out continuing to call , his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the rue du bac .: 96.30
<S> the thing is clear as day , said he ; and you must have had a very confiding nature , as well as a good heart , not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair . do you really think so ?: 48.40
<S> well , have you sent ? asked monte cristo , seeing morrel return .: 42.26
<S> thus , while contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was left , she broke out into sobs and tears .: 115.29
<S> we will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons ; if they send an army out against us , we will give battle , and the survivor , as d artagnan says , will carry the letter . well said , cried aramis ; you don t often speak , athos , but when you do speak , it is like st. john of the golden mouth .: 96.26
<S> who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be ? what do you think , aramis ? why , they are our men . you are not mistaken ; i recognize monsieur de flamarens . and i , monsieur de chatillon . as to the cavalier in the brown cloak it is the cardinal . in person . how the devil do they venture so near the hotel de bouillon ? athos smiled , but did not reply .: 48.04
<S> the way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of puritan congratulations .: 96.70
<S> no , but we are going to , replied d artagnan , pointing to grimaud , who had already climbed some five or six feet from the ground .: 24.15
<S> then he looked around him , and really recognized his dungeon .: 42.69
<S> really , said monte cristo , lowering his voice , you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage . mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me , replied morcerf , and that frightens me . bah , exclaimed monte cristo , that s a fine reason to give .: 26.81
<S> scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously , that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much <UNK> .: 251.30
<S> the four friends , during the period of these two <UNK> , had , as may well be supposed , the eye on the watch , the nose to the wind , and the ear on the hark .: 64.68
<S> he had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover ; and he felt , from one cause or another , that this woman was his own , as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her .: 142.57
<S> well , madame , said de winter , when the queen had dismissed her attendants .: 20.71
<S> this horrible place contained fifty cells ; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell , and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond dante s he was now number 34 .: 177.31
<S> monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips ; then drawing near to ali , he whispered : remain here , concealed in the dark , and whatever noise you hear , whatever passes , only come in or show yourself if i call you . ali bowed in token of strict obedience .: 92.95
<S> in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness .: 224.28
<S> since last evening , he added , smiling , you have done enough in my service , and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you time . thank you , sir ; it will be well employed , i hope . cromwell turned as he was going .: 40.60
<S> there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach .: 118.52
<S> yesterday i was at the house of a doctor of theology , whom i sometimes consult about my studies . athos smiled .: 96.72
<S> come , gentlemen , have you decided ? cried jussac for the third time .: 35.12
<S> did you bet ? oh , merely a paltry fifty louis . and who was the winner ? <UNK> .: 176.76
<S> well , asked the president , what do you say to this letter , general ? i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis xviii .: 46.52
<S> by whom did the queen send you this jewel ? she gave it to me herself . where ? in the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet . how ? giving me her hand to kiss . you have kissed the queen s hand ? said m. de tre ville , looking earnestly at d artagnan .: 48.35
<S> at the sight of the stranger , m. morrel closed the ledger , arose , and offered a seat to the stranger ; and when he had seen him seated , resumed his own chair .: 31.77
<S> return whence you came ; take back those horrible vegetables , and that poor <UNK> !: 483.33
<S> on the other side of the dungeon he perceived an <UNK> , the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall : oh , god ! he read , preserve my memory ! oh , yes , he cried , that was my only prayer at last ; i no longer begged for liberty , but memory ; i dreaded to become mad and forgetful .: 84.97
<S> now , what is it they want to know ?: 18.37
<S> de morcerf , said the president , do you recognize this lady as the daughter of ali tepelini , pasha of yanina ? no , said morcerf , attempting to rise , it is a base plot , contrived by my enemies . hayde e , whose eyes had been fixed on the door , as if expecting someone , turned hastily , and , seeing the count standing , shrieked , you do not know me ? said she .: 47.27
<S> teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could , and when he had quite disappeared , she went into the house with a sigh .: 26.36
<S> what can they have done with him ? oh , he has been taken to <UNK> , to <UNK> , or to the sainte <UNK> <UNK> islands .: 170.08
<S> in the shadow was a carriage with two horses , and some saddlehorses .: 66.48
<S> in case any evil should happen to me , said bragelonne .: 96.19
<S> request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me ; if so , let dinner be served in her apartments .: 145.03
<S> an instant afterward , the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends .: 42.86
<S> permit me to assure your excellency , said bertuccio , that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when i purchased yours . monte cristo shrugged his shoulders .: 38.46
<S> reflect that i am your wife ! you are a poisoner . in the name of heaven ! no ! in the name of the love you once bore me ! no , no ! in the name of our child !: 40.32
<S> how much you have need of me , cunning rogue ! thought gondy .: 71.02
<S> one evening , after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to marseilles from the catalans , she returned to her home more depressed than ever .: 108.36
<S> he could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners , since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time ; and he had hastened to saint germain to warn the queen of that disappearance .: 38.93
<S> the interests of the french crown , endangered at this moment , are to <UNK> rebellion in a neighboring nation .: 240.21
<S> old woman ! screamed nanette .: 104.81
<S> may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit ? said m. morrel , addressing the magistrate , whom he evidently knew ; there is doubtless some mistake easily explained . if it be so , replied the magistrate , rely upon every reparation being made ; meanwhile , i am the bearer of an order of arrest , and although i most reluctantly perform the task assigned me , it must , nevertheless , be fulfilled .: 104.08
<S> the committee decided to hear the letter ; the count was thoughtful and silent .: 58.20
<S> aramis , my good friend , this time you are wrong , interrupted porthos .: 24.63
<S> younger sons , he said , who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names .: 361.21
<S> athos is not a man to be thwarted ; he , like porthos , has obliged his peasantry to call him my lord , and to <UNK> his <UNK> place by the name of chateau .: 96.87
<S> madame de vernet was driven from me , putange was exiled , madame de chevreuse fell into disgrace , and when you wished to come back as ambassador to france , the king himself remember , my lord the king himself opposed it . yes , and france is about to pay for her king s refusal with a war .: 110.27
<S> danglars knew that he was heard , so he redoubled his blows .: 56.21
<S> this , however , was nothing to a sculptor like vampa ; he examined the broken stock , calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder , and made a fresh stock , so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres , had he chosen to sell it .: 141.37
<S> a conjugal scene chapter xlvi .: 144.00
<S> these <UNK> escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove , and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot .: 213.61
<S> the light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning ; as for the men , they were scarcely perceptible , the darkness was so great .: 62.34
<S> they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six weeks . m. coquenard entered , pushed along upon his armchair with <UNK> by mme .: 237.67
<S> against <UNK> , said m. de tre ville .: 54.35
<S> he didn t predict the future , he knew the past often a more dangerous thing . mazarin nodded an assent , but wishing to know what this prediction was , about which they disputed , he remained in the same place .: 127.04
<S> he cried out , and staggered against the wall like a drunken man , then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbe s cell to his own , and said , i must be alone , to think over all this . when he regained his dungeon , he threw himself on his bed , where the turnkey found him in the evening visit , sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features , dumb and motionless as a statue .: 70.48
<S> i accept .: 68.44
<S> well , thought d artagnan , poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead , and dead by my fault for it was i who dragged him into this affair , of which he did not know the origin , of which he is ignorant of the result , and from which he can derive no advantage . without reckoning , monsieur , added planchet to his master s <UNK> expressed reflections , that we perhaps owe our lives to him .: 77.77
<S> that god , desirous in his mercy to punish but one person , has visited this justice on him alone . monte cristo with a smile on his lips , uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it .: 82.94
<S> i know not what we shall do yet , but four determined men can do much .: 97.74
<S> she was very plainly dressed , as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the morning .: 66.39
<S> as to what is said , everybody is discontented , everybody complains , but everybody means nobody . explain yourself , my good friend , said the coadjutor .: 94.32
<S> i believe , and i repeat it to your majesty , that the queen conspires against the power of the king , but i have not said against his honor . and i i tell you against both .: 51.06
<S> d artagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not foreseen .: 53.49
<S> with what ideas does that letter inspire you ? oh , it is simple enough , madame ; it inspires me with the idea that m. danglars has left suspiciously . certainly ; but is this all you have to say to me ? i do not understand you , said debray with freezing coldness .: 54.09
<S> all the servants surrounded her , offering her assistance .: 118.78
<S> thanks , father , thanks . and feeling in his pocket , he took thence a small pocket book , which contained ten bank notes , each of 1,000 francs .: 86.21
<S> it is true they might have taken others , but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet , as we have seen , had no liking for forests after dark .: 95.10
<S> thank him , then , my child , in your very best manner ; for , had he not come to our aid , neither you nor i would have been alive to speak our thanks . the child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner , saying , he s too ugly . <UNK> the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes , while madame de villefort <UNK> her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed .: 125.50
<S> draw up this note for us , aramis ; but by our holy father the pope , cut it short , for i shall <UNK> you in my turn , i warn you . i ask no better , said aramis , with that ingenious air of confidence which every poet has in himself ; but let me be properly acquainted with the subject .: 69.20
<S> the english , repulsed foot by foot , beaten in all encounters , and defeated in the passage of the isle of <UNK> , were obliged to re embark , leaving on the field of battle two thousand men , among whom were five <UNK> , three lieutenant <UNK> , two hundred and fifty captains , twenty gentlemen of rank , four pieces of cannon , and sixty flags , which were taken to paris by <UNK> de st. simon , and suspended with great pomp in the arches of notre dame .: 209.65
<S> all the delicacies , in fact , that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach , and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the sea . a pretty silence truly ! said the old father of the bridegroom , as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz , and which had just been placed before merce de s herself .: 113.70
<S> what do you say ? that my orders go far , madame ; and that i am authorized to seek for the suspected paper , even on the person of your majesty . what horror ! cried the queen .: 59.21
<S> on arriving at the rue saint denis , the friends found a vast <UNK> of people .: 37.56
<S> but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion ?: 69.38
<S> or from your generosity , my friend ; to so good a marksman as you are , i may say what would appear absurd to another . what is that ? break his arm wound him but do not kill him . i will tell you , morrel , said the count , that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m. de morcerf ; he shall be so well spared , that he will return quietly with his two friends , while i and you ? that will be another thing ; i shall be brought home . no , no , cried maximilian , quite unable to restrain his feelings .: 61.68
<S> when the game was over , the duke , laughing at la ramee for his bad play , offered these men two louis d or to go and drink his health , with their four other comrades .: 126.91
<S> the two men smiled at each other , shook hands , and saluted his eminence .: 26.20
<S> but what has happened , then , since last evening , count ? the same thing that happened to brutus the night before the battle of <UNK> ; i have seen a ghost . and that ghost told me , morrel , that i had lived long enough . maximilian and emmanuel looked at each other .: 77.16
<S> by no means .: 31.88
<S> in ten minutes mazarin and his party were traversing the street les bons enfants behind the theatre built by richelieu expressly for the play of mirame , and in which mazarin , who was an amateur of music , but not of literature , had introduced into france the first opera that was ever acted in that country .: 188.16
<S> i am now quite at your service , gentlemen , said he .: 13.49
<S> sell the crown diamonds .: 353.07
<S> my friend , said aramis , if you like to ascend i shall be delighted to receive you . ah , said d artagnan , is that the way you return to your apartment ? after nine at night , pardieu ! said aramis , the rule of the convent is very severe . pardon me , my dear friend , said d artagnan , i think you said pardieu ! do you think so ? said aramis , smiling ; it is possible .: 26.55
<S> in spite of his repugnance to address the guards , dante s turned to the nearest gendarme , and taking his hand , comrade , said he , i <UNK> you , as a christian and a soldier , to tell me where we are going .: 53.44
<S> as for albert , he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him .: 120.52
<S> but young as you are , and scarcely entering into the world , you have powerful enemies ; if you do not take great heed , they will destroy you . alas , monseigneur ! replied the young man , very easily , no doubt , for they are strong and well supported , while i am alone . yes , that s true ; but alone as you are , you have done much already , and will do still more , i don t doubt .: 47.17
<S> i am dying with anxiety .: 25.69
<S> heaven pardon me , cried edmond , falling on his knees before his father .: 31.95
<S> you will find good cigars on the centre table .: 117.22
<S> he became curious to solve the problem .: 109.96
<S> ah , my friend ! said the abbe , turning towards dante s , and surveying him with the <UNK> gaze of a prophet , you are young , you will see all this come to pass . probably , if ever i get out of prison ! true , replied faria , we are prisoners ; but i forget this sometimes , and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls , and i fancy myself at liberty . but wherefore are you here ? because in 1807 i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in 1811 ; because , like machiavelli , i desired to alter the political face of italy , and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities , each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler , i sought to form one large , compact , and powerful empire ; and , lastly , because i fancied i had found my c sar borgia in a crowned simpleton , who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me .: 138.46
<S> put it up again , my friend , said d artagnan .: 10.13
<S> go , then , and take the waters of forges , or any that may be more agreeable to you , and <UNK> yourself as quickly as possible .: 36.82
<S> we even <UNK> very pleasantly , if i remember rightly , on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest .: 225.85
<S> and why ? asked scarron ; is he not a man of good birth ? certainly . agreeable ? undeniably . witty ? he has , unfortunately , too much wit . well , then , why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man ? because he is an enemy . of whom ? of the cardinal . what ? answered scarron , i continue to receive monsieur <UNK> <UNK> , who thinks ill of me , and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor , because he thinks ill of another man .: 77.08
<S> the commissary was seated in the chair , and was writing at the table .: 33.90
<S> well , my dear father , in the <UNK> of life for life is an eternal <UNK> of our hopes i cast into the sea my useless <UNK> , that is all , and i remain with my own will , disposed to live perfectly alone , and consequently perfectly free . unhappy girl , unhappy girl ! murmured danglars , turning pale , for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered .: 144.51
<S> the night was cold and still ; the family had all retired to rest but villefort , who alone remained up , and worked till five o clock in the morning , reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the examining magistrates , <UNK> the <UNK> of the witnesses , and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation , which was one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered .: 146.27
<S> they are beating the general alarm . the four friends listened , and the sound of the drum plainly reached them .: 82.62
<S> the footman was withdrawing , but athos stopped him by a sign .: 60.70
<S> taste this , and the <UNK> of possibility disappear ; the fields of infinite space open to you , you advance free in heart , free in mind , into the boundless realms of <UNK> reverie .: 639.37
<S> there is nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter . that is easily done , said aramis .: 24.23
<S> i too , sir , was almost dead when you arrived . wait , wait , young man ; do not fatigue yourself with speaking .: 76.30
<S> as for aramis , of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the character a character which , like that of his companions , we shall be able to follow in its <UNK> his lackey was called bazin .: 80.18
<S> general quesnel , it appears , had just left a bonapartist club when he disappeared .: 93.95
<S> in the first place , that , unfortunately , your husband is a simpleton and a fool ; in the next place , you are in trouble , of which i am very glad , as it gives me an opportunity of placing myself at your service , and god knows i am ready to throw myself into the fire for you ; finally , that the queen wants a brave , intelligent , devoted man to make a journey to london for her .: 49.91
<S> ma foi , my dear viscount , you are fated to hear music this evening ; you have only escaped from mademoiselle danglars piano , to be attacked by hayde e s guzla . hayde e what an adorable name !: 75.26
<S> believe me , there are only the two plans i have proposed to you ; forgive my vanity , and tell me which you prefer .: 55.36
<S> there they are .: 40.93
<S> the world will think you abandoned and poor , for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven , were she to keep up an appearance of <UNK> .: 143.18
<S> so , my dear viscount , whenever you wish to be <UNK> with music come and sup with me . i have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you , said morcerf .: 116.43
<S> but the eye of love had already seen , even through the narrow chinks of the wooden <UNK> , the movement of the white robe , and observed the fluttering of the blue <UNK> .: 122.16
<S> with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties .: 82.87
<S> presently the door opened , and she perceived felton .: 33.08
<S> in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room , where they took counsel together .: 66.92
<S> i will allow myself to die with hunger . come , said the wretch , is not peace much better than such a war as that ?: 50.24
<S> however , as it became dark , and i could no longer see , i fell asleep ; i was soon aroused by a piercing shriek , as from a person suffering in his dreams , and he suddenly threw his head back violently .: 71.92
<S> the blood no longer flowed from his wounds .: 82.35
<S> tell hayde e , said he , that i will take coffee with her , and give her to understand that i desire permission to present one of my friends to her . ali bowed and left the room .: 31.72
<S> do you know what consoled him ?: 40.86
<S> on my return , vasiliki and her daughter hayde e had disappeared . did you know them ? my intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them , and i had seen them above twenty times . have you any idea what became of them ? yes , sir ; i heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow , and , perhaps , to their poverty .: 82.08
<S> tedesco ! answered the cavalier ; <UNK> <UNK> . and advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in , he opened it and disappeared behind it , shutting it as he went .: 104.89
<S> near the camp you might be recognized ; and your presence , you must be aware , would compromise the cardinal . then i must wait here , or in the neighborhood ? only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the cardinal ; let me know always where to find you . observe , it is probable that i may not be able to remain here . why ? you forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute . that s true ; but is this little woman , then , to escape his eminence ? bah ! said milady , with a smile that belonged only to herself ; you forget that i am her best friend . ah , that s true !: 51.43
<S> friend , he said , you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune , that , at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our <UNK> , it would be a ridiculous piece of <UNK> in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis , whose cunning you know a cunning which , we may say between ourselves , is not always without egotism ; or by athos , a noble and disinterested man , but blase , who , desiring nothing further for himself , doesn t sympathize with the desires of others .: 131.62
<S> no , said the captain , i make but one bargain ; and i have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at boulogne . and shall we arrive there ? safe and sound , as true as my name s jack <UNK> . well , said milady , if you keep your word , instead of five hundred , i will give you a thousand pistoles . hurrah for you , then , my beautiful lady , cried the captain ; and may god often send me such passengers as your ladyship ! meanwhile , said felton , convey me to the little bay of ; you know it was agreed you should put in there . the captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers , and toward seven o clock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named .: 87.19
<S> the handle of this saucepan was of iron ; dante s would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it .: 45.03
<S> therefore mousqueton alone fell from his horse , not because he was severely wounded , but not being able to see the wound , he judged it to be more serious than it really was .: 68.29
<S> the prisoner did not wish to lose time ; and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon , by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was committed .: 114.97
<S> you are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and having understood them , can act with energy such was cardinal richelieu s opinion , my lord . the cardinal , interrupted mazarin , was a great politician and therein shone his vast superiority over me .: 132.47
<S> happiness almost <UNK> me ! the two friends began to dance around the venerable st. chrysostom , <UNK> about famously the sheets of the thesis , which had fallen on the floor .: 160.00
<S> not one of these glances , nor one sigh , was lost on her ; they might have been said to fall on the shield of <UNK> , which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of <UNK> .: 217.50
<S> they don t have lieutenants in a felucca <UNK> by a crew of four . yes , but monsieur groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind ; he has a lieutenant , and that lieutenant is monsieur mordaunt . this time the musketeers did more than shudder they almost cried out .: 115.44
<S> these gentlemen , comminges , are not prisoners , returned mazarin , with his ironical smile , only guests ; but guests so precious that i have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors , that they may not refuse to continue my visitors .: 146.71
<S> it is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest consumption .: 113.64
<S> no , there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness !: 96.05
<S> the presentation chapter 42 .: 71.91
<S> i can see neither heaven nor earth , said the jeweller , who was outside the door .: 47.34
<S> what is it to me , who have passed twenty years between life and death ?: 36.47
<S> they were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city , but athos replied , in excellent english , that they had been sent forward by colonel harrison to announce to his colleague , monsieur bridge , the approach of the king .: 77.14
<S> you can understand , dear friend , with what hope i was inspired by that last letter .: 45.94
<S> he arose , and quietly opening the door of the drawing room , saw hayde e , who had fallen on a chair , with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back .: 26.32
<S> he had made up his mind that he would go to the palais cardinal , and that he would learn what his eminence had to say to him .: 17.41
<S> halloo !: 28.51
<S> then turning to grimaud : very good , my friend , very good .: 29.83
<S> the coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of paris , and has a court .: 51.09
<S> m. d e pinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m. de villefort , who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning , should not have anticipated him in this announcement . no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment , so thoroughly <UNK> by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances , would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance ; although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor , or rather <UNK> , so far as to relate such a history .: 80.75
<S> the gascon shook his head , these tears from royalty melted his heart .: 123.10
<S> you will charge broussel to report it .: 61.94
<S> england is torn in <UNK> by a spirit of disturbance which , i greatly fear , blood alone can exorcise . but lord <UNK> , replied the queen , i have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained .: 372.29
<S> my dear m. cavalcanti , said andrea , taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner , how much are you paid for being my father ? the major was about to speak , when andrea continued , in a low voice : nonsense , i am going to set you an example of confidence , they give me 50,000 francs a year to be your son ; consequently , you can understand that it is not at all likely i shall ever deny my parent . the major looked anxiously around him .: 45.43
<S> it was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate , for maximilian had long awaited her coming .: 82.61
<S> whoever did it writes well .: 501.60
<S> after breakfast two letters arrived for athos , who read them with profound attention , whilst d artagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these <UNK> , in one of which , there being at the time a very strong light , he perceived the fine writing of aramis .: 100.12
<S> it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the community .: 206.37
<S> i shall be expecting you , and if you fail to come , i shall think for how do i know to the contrary ? that this house , which has remained uninhabited for twenty years , must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it . i will come , count , i will be sure to come , said villefort eagerly .: 68.37
<S> but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever , since fear urges me , not my conscience . but , replied madame danglars , the count of monte cristo can know nothing , or he would not seek our society as he does . oh , the wickedness of man is very great , said villefort , since it surpasses the goodness of god .: 54.93
<S> his signal was returned , and in two hours afterwards the new comer lay at anchor beside the yacht .: 85.85
<S> numberless groups paraded the streets and , whatever d artagnan might think of it , it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance , in order to assume a warlike aspect .: 185.31
<S> know that monsieur de bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine , even if obliged to pay a pistole for every drop . his manner became more and more lofty every instant ; then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was .: 139.05
<S> how can i tell ?: 14.27
<S> you may understand that the moment has come for me to re enter the bosom of the church . and why today , rather than yesterday or tomorrow ?: 68.87
<S> the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour .: 130.60
<S> a circle was immediately formed around the door .: 91.48
<S> when i think of you my heart beats fast , the blood burns in my veins , and i can hardly breathe ; but i solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor , this fervor and intensity of feeling , until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you .: 162.26
<S> wretch ! returned the old man , what hast thou done ? and he gazed with terror on rita , pale and bloody , a knife buried in her bosom .: 68.09
<S> excuse me , excuse me , but i owe this money to the charity fund , a deposit which i promised to pay this morning . oh , well , then , said monte cristo , i am not particular about these five notes , pay me in a different form ; i wished , from curiosity , to take these , that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of danglars had paid me five millions without a minute s delay ; it would have been remarkable .: 69.58
<S> in a corner , almost hidden from view , were three gentlemen , who had preceded athos and aramis , and an officer was examining their passports .: 69.98
<S> follow my advice , swear , and do not insult . the general , again daunted by the superiority of the chief , hesitated a moment ; then advancing to the president s desk , what is the form , said he .: 66.26
<S> i have known persons , he continued for he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of d artagnan who by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu ; who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies ; persons without money , without support , without credit , yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal <UNK> pardon . but those men you speak of , said mazarin , smiling <UNK> on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him , those men were not devoted to the cardinal , for they contended against him . no ; in that case they would have met with more fitting reward .: 186.05
<S> well , go and fetch them , and come to my apartment .: 22.12
<S> franz took the lamp , and entered the subterranean grotto , followed by gaetano .: 51.40
<S> you raised the whole district , so they told me ! very nearly , replied planchet , with a self satisfied air .: 93.32
<S> d artagnan followed them .: 14.78
<S> i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron s banking establishment ? i was not aware of it , replied albert , but i can readily believe it . and , further , that he stated to m. danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris , during which time he proposed to spend six millions .: 59.85
<S> the first glance which maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him , and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight .: 106.51
<S> the patrol passed .: 48.70
<S> twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes .: 106.38
<S> oh ! he said , taking up his hat , which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head , we will soon find out . in what way ? why , the fair is on at beaucaire , there are always jewellers from paris there , and i will show it to them .: 45.97
<S> the actors made their entries and <UNK> unobserved or <UNK> of ; at certain conventional moments , the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation , or rouse themselves from their <UNK> , to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani s , a well executed <UNK> by coselli , or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia ; but that momentary excitement over , they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation .: 595.18
<S> in a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house , and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds .: 62.95
<S> while in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessaly , but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone .: 80.84
<S> speak !: 35.77
<S> i thought i did not mistake .: 21.76
<S> presently , by a change in the atmosphere , he knew that they were entering a cave ; after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling , and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed , and became balmy and perfumed .: 102.14
<S> well , so much the better ; for in that case i shall demand of his majesty permission to plead for him . the king feared an <UNK> .: 65.28
<S> mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman , around whom the three other frenchmen were standing , pale and menacing .: 98.52
<S> m. and madame de villefort bowed and left the room , giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfather s presence , and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the <UNK> spirit of the invalid .: 62.02
<S> sir , said he to danglars , understand that i do not take a final leave of you ; i must ascertain if your insinuations are just , and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo . he bowed to the banker , and went out with beauchamp , without appearing to notice cavalcanti .: 46.67
<S> decidedly , this is a clever fellow , murmured athos .: 28.99
<S> tis indeed they ! said she .: 74.87
<S> ah , this time , cried d artagnan , springing to his sword , this time he will not escape me ! drawing his sword from its scabbard , he rushed out of the apartment .: 24.81
<S> can it be with me ?: 23.64
<S> d artagnan dressed himself , and athos did the same .: 19.98
<S> morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me , replied dante s .: 37.81
<S> i will go to the queen . and louis xiii. , opening the door of communication , passed into the corridor which led from his apartments to those of anne of austria .: 30.85
<S> the people are hurrying on , the soldiers under arms , and among the spectators i see d artagnan .: 70.92
<S> unfortunately , i didn t crush him flat .: 102.53
<S> there was a moment s silence , and then a voice , in excellent french , although , with a foreign accent , said : welcome , sir .: 38.75
<S> m .: 15.88
<S> this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest <UNK> would have been .: 140.63
<S> but you have been traveling these four days , as you told me yourself .: 44.71
<S> well , what is this island ? the island of monte cristo . but i have no permission to shoot over this island . your excellency does not require a permit , for the island is uninhabited . ah , indeed ! said the young man .: 33.66
<S> instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death , the piazza del popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and <UNK> .: 282.05
<S> silence ! said d artagnan , pressing her hand still more warmly .: 23.97
<S> he removed his seat into a corner of the room , where he himself would be in deep shadow , while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator ; then , with head bent down and hands clasped , or rather clenched together , he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse , who seated himself on the little stool , exactly opposite to him .: 72.25
<S> the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall , and enclosed the villefort and saint me ran coffins .: 111.38
<S> these four men were not princes , neither were they dukes , neither were they men in power ; they were not even rich .: 104.93
<S> my lord , i think we are in bad company . a man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand .: 30.49
<S> you are now sanguinary ; but take care .: 66.24
<S> everywhere .: 152.56
<S> it is a bad sign ; a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks , and such fever in the hands of a man . but , your excellency , replied bertuccio hesitatingly , did not the abbe busoni , who heard my confession in the prison at ni mes , tell you that i had a heavy burden upon my conscience ? yes ; but as he said you would make an excellent steward , i concluded you had stolen that was all . oh , your excellency ! returned bertuccio in deep contempt .: 71.04
<S> he heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door ; and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept the light .: 117.30
<S> where he was no one knew .: 52.37
<S> and his <UNK> ; and he saw that the <UNK> was not half empty .: 137.70
<S> well ? asked the queen well , madame , replied the valet , i followed them as far as the gates .: 33.61
<S> the chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials ; over the doors were painted <UNK> of shepherds and <UNK> , after the style and manner of <UNK> ; and at each side pretty <UNK> in <UNK> , harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment , the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed .: 449.48
<S> have you really no desire to meet him ? none whatever , replied euge nie .: 34.16
<S> d artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with lord de winter , and then returned to milady .: 24.17
<S> the change that had come over villefort during the examination , the destruction of the letter , the exacted promise , the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate , who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment , all returned with a stunning force to his memory .: 185.19
<S> buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him , and which , at the end of half an hour , was transformed into a workshop .: 61.03
<S> he will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs ; get as near to him as you can , and cut off two .: 116.80
<S> come , take the lantern , and let us visit the garden ; you are not afraid of ghosts with me , i hope ? bertuccio raised the lantern , and obeyed .: 35.68
<S> at the same hour as on the preceding evening , d artagnan retired .: 25.20
<S> the repast was magnificent ; monte cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian ideas , and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests .: 82.36
<S> the latter had surpassed himself ; he showed la ramee a monstrous pate , ornamented with monsieur de beaufort s coat of arms .: 122.33
<S> the latter , sure of <UNK> the tempest when the waves became too violent , allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate andrea , and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day .: 160.31
<S> so let us go and get killed where we are told to go .: 47.45
<S> hold , athos , said aramis , perhaps there is yet time .: 40.84
<S> had we not better lower our heads ? in truth , murmured d artagnan , to whom m. de tre ville s recommendation recurred , this animal will end by making me afraid . and he put his horse into a trot .: 83.65
<S> i fancied that i still heard faint moans , and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead , i determined to go to his relief , by way of <UNK> in some slight degree , not for the crime i had committed , but for that which i had not endeavored to prevent .: 93.07
<S> you understand this , do you not , my most precious wife ?: 45.11
<S> do you recollect that ball , count , where you produced such an effect ? <UNK> no , i do not , replied monte cristo , without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking , so much was he occupied in watching morrel , who was holding his breath with emotion .: 76.31
<S> the epithet , as may be easily understood , resounded to the very bottom of d artagnan s heart .: 50.45
<S> madame , said athos , passing his arm under that of d artagnan , we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman .: 76.37
<S> we were to have conveyed her to a ho tel in the place royale , said the wounded man .: 24.78
<S> justify yourself if you can .: 226.63
<S> the vendetta chapter 45 .: 41.07
<S> well , i was but four years old when one night i was suddenly awakened by my mother .: 59.55
<S> at the same time the door was opened .: 4.97
<S> very well , take blaisois , with whom i know not what to do , since i already have grimaud . willingly , said aramis .: 63.61
<S> and therefore , added he , quietly , i have not confidence in every one ; the proof of which is , that i have fixed upon you to escort me . shall you not go with the queen ? no , replied mazarin .: 29.22
<S> two hours after , as midnight sounded , the sentinel was relieved .: 45.53
<S> his company was on guard at the louvre ; he was at the louvre with his company .: 22.87
<S> oh , sir , exclaimed m. de boville , your fears are unfortunately but too well founded , and you see before you a man in despair .: 65.24
<S> he arrived ; valentine was expecting him .: 64.99
<S> god forbid !: 64.32
<S> he was supplied with bread of a finer , whiter quality than the usual prison fare , and even <UNK> each sunday with a small quantity of wine .: 304.36
<S> why , really i know no one , said the major .: 21.61
<S> what do you say to a thousand crowns ? d artagnan <UNK> out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner .: 62.67
<S> is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago ? certainly not longer . well , i am sure it is quite transformed since last week .: 60.90
<S> i am the bearer of a letter , that is all .: 14.21
<S> at the corner of the quai they encountered bazin , who was running breathlessly .: 55.18
<S> you are about my height , pierre , said he .: 39.40
<S> a black satin stock , fresh from the maker s hands , gray moustaches , a bold eye , a major s uniform , ornamented with three medals and five crosses in fact , the thorough bearing of an old soldier such was the appearance of major bartolomeo cavalcanti , that tender father with whom we are already acquainted .: 209.59
<S> the pont du gard inn chapter 27 .: 127.37
<S> search among your friends , your oldest friends . what do you mean , monsieur ? nothing else than i say search . alas , i look around me in vain !: 93.45
<S> you can form no idea of the expression of that old man s eye when he looks at me , the only person in the world whom he loves , and , i had almost said , by whom he is beloved in return .: 50.17
<S> have you seen the king ? yes , and all goes well . we are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven . it was then striking half past ten by st. paul s .: 42.91
<S> determined to put the advice of m. de tre ville in practice instantly , d artagnan directed his course toward the rue des fossoyeurs , in order to superintend the <UNK> of his valise .: 43.52
<S> monte cristo opened the carriage door , morrel sprang out on the pavement , bertuccio was waiting on the steps .: 29.20
<S> en route , monsieur d artagnan , said the cardinal ; all goes well in this direction . d artagnan , in the meantime , had taken the head of his detachment without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks the character of an old soldier .: 59.78
<S> he instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat , on the top of which he met de rochefort .: 46.90
<S> i have taken from you one carte blanche to give you another .: 93.46
<S> <UNK> , the pilot of the saint ferdinand , went in once , and he came back amazed , <UNK> that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales . do you know , observed franz , that with such stories you make me think of ali baba s enchanted cavern ? i tell you what i have been told . then you advise me to accept ? oh , i don t say that ; your excellency will do as you please ; i should be sorry to advise you in the matter . franz pondered the matter for a few moments , concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of <UNK> him of what little he had , and seeing only the prospect of a good supper , accepted .: 95.06
<S> you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg works .: 21.56
<S> that is my name , said athos , quietly .: 11.79
<S> repeat it !: 81.83
<S> is it not worth 300,000 francs to save our father s name from the chances of evil fortune and failure ? i thought so , replied emmanuel ; but i wished to have your advice . this is my counsel : our accounts are made up and our bills paid ; all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more , and close our office . this was done instantly .: 97.43
<S> still the same story of superfluities !: 185.04
<S> ah , sir ! replied raoul , her fall is a very serious one , and without any ostensible injury , the physician fears she will be lame for life . this is terrible , said athos .: 70.01
<S> as d artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself , porthos believed he had not been seen .: 26.50
<S> i saw my father s hand tremble .: 19.21
<S> monsieur d artagnan ! it cried .: 16.19
<S> i fancy i begin to see my way , murmured milady , with a savage joy , burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction .: 126.08
<S> albert s love had not taken away his appetite .: 91.30
<S> ample <UNK> of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above mentioned edmond dante s , who either carries the letter for paris about with him , or has it at his father s abode .: 241.61
<S> bah , said debray , when she had left , these are fine projects !: 77.54
<S> when one puts on a mask , it is not difficult to wear a beard under it . i am sorry i did not follow him , said porthos .: 43.40
<S> consider , by becoming a gardener i effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger . <UNK> i beseech of you , maximilian , to cease trifling , and tell me what you really mean . simply , that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which i stand was to let , i made application for it , was readily accepted by the proprietor , and am now master of this fine crop of lucern .: 287.06
<S> raoul , seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers , halted to wait for olivain .: 60.90
<S> what a pity mademoiselle de villefort is dead !: 33.67
<S> but dante s was so honorable and true in his own nature , that he believed everybody s professions of friendship .: 90.96
<S> she was thinking of the despair of maximilian , when he should be informed that madame de saint me ran , instead of being an ally , was unconsciously acting as his enemy .: 46.46
<S> when a carriage is chosen , it ought to be strong .: 51.47
<S> good day , penelon , returned morrel , who could not refrain from smiling through his tears , where is the captain ? the captain , m. morrel , he has stayed behind sick at palma ; but please god , it won t be much , and you will see him in a few days all alive and hearty . well , now tell your story , penelon . <UNK> penelon rolled his quid in his cheek , placed his hand before his mouth , turned his head , and sent a long jet of tobacco <UNK> into the antechamber , advanced his foot , balanced himself , and began .: 114.00
<S> he had only to step over the corpse , enter the boudoir , take the child in his arms , and flee far , far away .: 77.91
<S> the conversation took place in english a language which d artagnan could not understand ; but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage .: 86.56
<S> he had but one thought to go forward ; and he went .: 29.21
<S> buckingham , left alone , walked toward a mirror .: 79.41
<S> nevertheless , it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family , and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years .: 40.73
<S> my ho tel will be always open to you .: 49.36
<S> in the evening , julie told her mother , that although he was apparently so calm , she had noticed that her father s heart beat violently .: 65.44
<S> she will receive five shillings per day for lodging and food .: 279.87
<S> they threw themselves upon me .: 44.85
<S> i have nothing but memory .: 39.45
<S> do you know what you look like , all together , as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys ? said the cardinal .: 49.68
<S> benedetto could read , write , and cipher perfectly , for when the fit seized him , he learned more in a day than others in a week .: 137.30
<S> at the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death , a vulture is flying by there are a good many vultures in adelmonte s country ; this bird darts on the dead fowl , and carries it away to a rock , where it dines off its prey .: 244.74
<S> look at me well in your turn .: 31.29
<S> d artagnan thought it would suffice for him , and he sprang forward like a dart between them .: 27.01
<S> m. morrel , allow me to present to you m. franz d e pinay , a delightful travelling companion , with whom i made the tour of italy .: 43.05
<S> oh , monsieur , you can write as much as you like ; you may become equal to monsieur de voiture and monsieur de benserade .: 37.49
<S> italy seems fated to misfortune . and the old man bowed his head .: 80.74
<S> we have accomplished more difficult things than that .: 68.75
<S> de chevreuse who , though exiled to tours and believed to be in that city , had come to paris , remained there five days , and <UNK> the police the king flew into a furious passion .: 133.19
<S> a day or two of rest will set me up , and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for <UNK> . a peculiar smile passed over dante s lips ; he <UNK> jacopo s hand warmly , but nothing could shake his determination to remain and remain alone .: 177.03
<S> zounds , i thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the room .: 134.22
<S> although la rochelle was invested , however certain success might appear thanks to the precautions taken , and above all to the dyke , which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city the <UNK> might last a long time yet .: 241.23
<S> yes , monsieur , a most excellent sister . married ? nearly nine years . happy ? asked the count again .: 85.66
<S> madame , more hopeless than he thinks .: 112.29
<S> that s unworthy .: 173.32
<S> now give me the cardinal up here ; if he makes any noise stifle him . mazarin wished to call out , but porthos held him tight and passed him to d artagnan , who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him ; then in a menacing tone , he said : sir !: 56.29
<S> on the cross i swear to denounce you everywhere as a murderer , as a thief of honor , as a base coward !: 107.70
<S> the man was m. de villefort ; i fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone . <UNK> and , asked the count , did you ever know the name of this woman ? no , excellency , returned bertuccio ; you will see that i had no time to learn it . go on . that evening , continued bertuccio , i could have killed the procureur , but as i was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood , i was fearful of not killing him on the spot , and that if his cries were overheard i might be taken ; so i put it off until the next occasion , and in order that nothing should escape me , i took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden .: 44.54
<S> oh , that i could , instead of taking up this defence , shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth . these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused .: 142.99
<S> what is life to me ? very little without you , mother ; for believe me , but for you i should have ceased to live on the day i doubted my father and renounced his name .: 61.66
<S> today is the <UNK> of august ; the 21st of september will , therefore , be the conclusion of the term agreed on , and till that time arrives and it is the advice of a gentleman which i am about to give you till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other . when he had concluded his speech , beauchamp bowed coldly to albert , turned his back upon him , and went to the press room .: 124.84
<S> edmond was obliged to assist him , for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dante s chamber .: 34.25
<S> a great man in every country , m. debray , said cha teau renaud .: 21.28
<S> villefort , closely watching his countenance and his lips , awaited the result of the examination .: 81.12
<S> danglars asked for a knife and fork .: 155.54
<S> throwing down his spit , and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle , and the servants with their sticks , he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter .: 210.89
<S> and athos ? i have not yet seen him .: 21.03
<S> this new cargo was destined for the coast of the duchy of lucca , and consisted almost entirely of havana cigars , sherry , and malaga <UNK> .: 321.19
<S> it is a rich study for you , who , as i learn , have seen as many lands as are <UNK> on this map . yes , sir , replied the count ; i have sought to make of the human race , taken in the mass , what you practice every day on individuals a physiological study .: 111.25
<S> let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his cloak .: 79.99
<S> byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires , and even assured me that he had seen them .: 59.43
<S> villefort and franz returned to the faubourg saint honore .: 17.49
<S> he , the man who would be popular , can not forgive the count of morcerf for being created a peer ; and this marriage broken off without a reason being assigned yes , it is all from the same cause . make inquiries , albert , but do not be angry without reason ; make inquiries , and if it be true oh , yes , if it be true , cried the young man , he shall pay me all i have suffered . beware , morcerf , he is already an old man . i will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family ; if my father had offended him , why did he not attack him personally ?: 71.50
<S> in a few minutes valentine re entered the garden alone .: 48.69
<S> it was a gloomy , dusty looking apartment , such as journalists offices have always been from time <UNK> .: 445.79
<S> but i was at my own house , you understand , so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards , which i did .: 38.76
<S> is there anything else i can assist you in discovering , besides the villany of your friends ? inquired the abbe with a laugh .: 59.03
<S> caderousse s hands still grasped the gold and bank notes , and la carconte called up her sweetest smiles while <UNK> the reappearance of their guest .: 206.12
<S> we shall see , returned the other , smiling .: 20.64
<S> you are crazy .: 76.90
<S> speak , my child , speak , said d artagnan ; i listen . here ?: 23.98
<S> it will suffice , then , to tell them that at the moment at which , discouraged by so many fruitless investigations , we were about to abandon our search , we at length found , guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend <UNK> paris , a manuscript in folio , endorsed <UNK> or <UNK> , we do not recollect which , having for title , memoirs of the comte de la fe re , touching some events which passed in france toward the end of the reign of king louis xiii .: 123.29
<S> take this peach , then , she said .: 43.07
<S> and how do you know it ? asked milady , seizing both his hands , and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart .: 18.23
<S> i resisted .: 52.06
<S> what is his name ? major cavalcanti . is he pleased with you ? so far i have appeared to answer his purpose . and who found this father for you ? the count of monte cristo . the man whose house you have just left ? yes . i wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather , since he holds the money chest ! well , i will mention you to him .: 54.37
<S> come !: 17.12
<S> then there will be no blood , no groans , no convulsions , and above all , no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act , then one escapes the clutch of the human law , which says , do not disturb society ! this is the mode in which they manage these things , and succeed in eastern climes , where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in <UNK> of importance . yet conscience remains , remarked madame de villefort in an agitated voice , and with a stifled sigh .: 225.65
<S> an angel alone could have saved one of us from death that angel came from heaven , if not to make us friends which , alas , fatality renders impossible , at least to make us esteem each other . monte cristo , with moistened eye , heaving breast , and lips half open , extended to albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear .: 188.29
<S> the injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy , until conviction seizes on his mind , and then , in a frenzy of rage and indignation , he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his vengeance .: 191.44
<S> now , he said , are you in pain ? yes ; my head is not only swimming but burning . what s the matter with this head ? said d artagnan , raising the <UNK> hat .: 56.54
<S> and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden ; the earth , black as soot , the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence ; besides , had natural <UNK> been wanting , it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means , thanks to a <UNK> of water , sunk in one of the corners of the garden , and upon which were stationed a frog and a <UNK> , who , from antipathy , no doubt , always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin .: 120.13
<S> the sight is hideous . fools , said charles , do they take me for a coward , like themselves ?: 122.50
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> franz lowered a torch , and saw by the mass of <UNK> that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat , which was , doubtless , one of the <UNK> places of the wandering visitors of monte cristo .: 80.18
<S> tomorrow , by twelve o clock , i shall have the order for your exile , signed , buckingham .: 49.65
<S> at the same time the door opened ; a man appeared on the threshold .: 7.94
<S> d artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly .: 18.97
<S> in ten minutes , said the count to his companion , we shall be there . he then took peppino aside , gave him an order in a low voice , and peppino went away , taking with him a torch , brought with them in the carriage .: 36.53
<S> he found the cardinal dressed as an officer , and he looked very well in that costume , which , as we have already said , he wore elegantly ; only he was very pale and trembled slightly .: 48.83
<S> the duke frowned , the officer felt the point of the poniard , which , having penetrated through his clothes , was close to his heart .: 42.89
<S> the remembrance of strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him , the shadow that haunted him by day and night .: 128.97
<S> i again reminded her that you were a friend , and that she need not conceal anything from you . then , said albert , this pious <UNK> in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance ; what is the next ? oh , then i remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some <UNK> trees , on the borders of a lake , in the waters of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror .: 96.09
<S> what had she done to excite the malice of an enemy ?: 65.40
<S> there was more than benevolence in this action ; there was courage ; the south was aflame , and to assist , even on his death bed , the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dante s , was <UNK> as a crime .: 110.77
<S> from that day d artagnan felt lonely and powerless , without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should <UNK> him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven .: 100.39
<S> but the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness , without betraying either disturbance or surprise , that should the agitators refuse obedience to the king s wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among them .: 215.58
<S> in a quarter of an hour athos joined them and at the same moment charles brought in a letter for d artagnan , which a messenger had just desired might be instantly delivered .: 63.87
<S> upon arriving at her hotel , franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company ; on the contrary , her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants .: 94.40
<S> but do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of d artagnan , who is a faithful friend whom i love and defend , or i swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit , or shall have committed , shall be the last . monsieur d artagnan has cruelly insulted me , said milady , in a hollow tone ; monsieur d artagnan shall die ! indeed !: 53.19
<S> joy shone in raoul s eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle .: 95.88
<S> false !: 155.04
<S> have you it ? asked raoul yes that is , i had it , <UNK> the gascon , making believe to find it .: 116.59
<S> that gentleman is the abbe d herblay , replied he .: 19.05
<S> patrick ! cried the duke , opening the door of the chapel , patrick ! his confidential valet appeared .: 48.00
<S> and those two <UNK> portraits , that have faded from the <UNK> ; do they not seem to say , with their pale lips and staring eyes , we have seen ? villefort became livid ; madame danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney .: 145.13
<S> yes , my prince . my prince ! interrupted d artagnan .: 19.76
<S> patience , patience !: 127.60
<S> but all the time he was in paris , you , of course , did not lose sight of him ? no , sire . where did he lodge ? rue de la harpe .: 29.71
<S> i understand my game , kitty ; i have this one safe . what will you do with him , madame ? what will i do with him ?: 35.15
<S> i am a man of order , sir ; let us do things in order . nevertheless , replied mordaunt , i could compel you ; i command here . ah , sir ! said d artagnan , i see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us .: 34.19
<S> the groom cried aloud for help .: 77.81
<S> the party assembled , the room was lighted with <UNK> , and the prisoner , with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room , had traced a long white line , representing a cord , on the floor .: 67.71
<S> all these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance ; but they might be the fruits of a plot .: 82.10
<S> to saint peter s first , and then to the colosseum , returned albert .: 54.18
<S> his head , with piercing eyes , a straight nose , a chin cut like that of brutus , had altogether an indefinable character of grandeur and grace .: 137.76
<S> i do not understand , my lord , said she , in order to gain time and make her adversary speak out .: 31.79
<S> from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage , and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready .: 136.63
<S> the rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more ; the idea that he left behind him , exposed to a frightful vengeance , the woman he loved , or rather whom he adored as a saint , the emotion he had experienced , present fatigue all together exalted his mind above human feeling .: 227.42
<S> allow me to take a glass of water in your apartment ; you know that is never refused among neighbors . without waiting for the permission of his host , d artagnan went quickly into the house , and cast a rapid glance at the bed .: 43.80
<S> look , emmanuel . then turning towards monte cristo , count , said he , in the name of all that is dear to you , i entreat you not to kill albert ! the unhappy youth has a mother . you are right , said monte cristo ; and i have none . these words were uttered in a tone which made morrel shudder .: 28.92
<S> i was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it . have you shown this letter to anyone ? asked villefort , becoming still more pale .: 51.93
<S> why , i lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man .: 36.53
<S> the latter continued in thought .: 55.82
<S> let the civil war last but one year and i will have a constable s sword gilt for me . and for me ? put in porthos .: 250.77
<S> he was shown in directly ; he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not <UNK> , in two hours paris would be under arms .: 158.96
<S> the battle of lens gained ! said the queen ; they are lucky here indeed ; they can gain battles !: 191.49
<S> we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor , but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend we have been guided by an invisible hand , a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter . oh , cried julie , i have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand , as i now kiss the purse which he has touched .: 101.21
<S> go , sir , go ! but morrel remained motionless ; he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed , and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it .: 48.17
<S> doctor , pray recall your words ; you have said nothing , have you ? my dear m. de villefort , replied the doctor , my first duty is to humanity .: 45.59
<S> he clung to one idea that of his happiness , destroyed , without apparent cause , by an unheard of fatality ; he considered and <UNK> this idea , devoured it so to speak , as the implacable <UNK> <UNK> the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante .: 401.43
<S> the sea continued to get calmer .: 145.83
<S> the evening was no longer joy , but delirium .: 50.07
<S> he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep , and having found his diamond ring on his finger , his purse in his pocket , and his pistols in his belt , he rose , paid for his bottle , and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before .: 47.19
<S> i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman , beautiful but <UNK> . oh , replied caderousse , did he know so little of his lovely betrothed ?: 117.23
<S> d artagnan gave the open letter to kitty , who at first was unable to comprehend it , but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time .: 63.04
<S> you know how difficult it is to discover the truth ; and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes louis xiii .: 115.17
<S> adieu , mademoiselle .: 37.79
<S> information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation project gutenberg depends upon and can not survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment .: 31.24
<S> i have sent for one , replied the abbe .: 16.49
<S> what has happened ? asked the countess , as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life ; did you say a misfortune ?: 74.56
<S> you would expose the self love of another with a hatchet , but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle . but yet , m. danglars appeared delighted with you , was he not ?: 115.28
<S> i am young and strong ; i believe i am courageous , and since yesterday i have learned the power of will .: 41.16
<S> there are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration .: 354.77
<S> these studs can not be trusted to anybody ; it must be done in the palace . impossible , my lord !: 36.36
<S> dante s continued his search .: 22.98
<S> pray learn , monsieur olivain , that people like us are not to be served by cowards .: 75.20
<S> when it arrived there , four guards and a police officer , who accompanied it , mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters ; then through an opening cautiously made , the <UNK> began to watch the length of the rue <UNK> , as if he was waiting for some one .: 98.62
<S> in short , madame danglars , not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30,000 francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money , had deputed those eyes , by which she was accustomed to see , to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person .: 145.41
<S> what could put such an idea into your head ? yourself . ah ? what next ? most assuredly . i should like to know upon what occasion ? oh , mon dieu ! that is very easily done .: 65.28
<S> he found that he was in a grotto , went towards the opening , and through a kind of <UNK> saw a blue sea and an azure sky .: 85.14
<S> i shall hear this morning that m. danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies , and at his wife s this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france .: 75.68
<S> but he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned ! said felton , with increasing exultation .: 87.81
<S> the coachman stooped down for his orders .: 74.62
<S> but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste , was a dark mole , of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are , placed just at the corner of her mouth ; and the effect tended to increase the expression of self dependence that characterized her countenance .: 297.03
<S> still , marquise , it has been so with other <UNK> cromwell , for instance , who was not half so bad as napoleon , had his partisans and advocates . do you know , villefort , that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain ?: 145.02
<S> his majesty , in full dress , was accompanied by his royal highness , m. le comte de soissons , by the grand prior , by the duc de longueville , by the duc d <UNK> <UNK> , by the comte d harcourt , by the comte de la roche <UNK> , by m. de <UNK> , by m. de <UNK> , by the comte de <UNK> , and by the chevalier de <UNK> .: 106.30
<S> the halberds were for the audience in the rear ; the muskets are for us . thirty , forty , fifty , sixty five men , said porthos , counting the <UNK> .: 114.16
<S> why has he not painted a spot upon his heart ? it would have been more simple . meanwhile albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men .: 58.30
<S> paris , this odious paris , waking up one morning without queen or king , surrounded , besieged , famished having for its sole resource its stupid parliament and their coadjutor with crooked limbs ! charming !: 1407.92
<S> go on , said he .: 7.91
<S> let me propose it , then , said d artagnan .: 11.90
<S> i stood in the same attitude , and threw myself down .: 44.84
<S> i forgive you .: 28.85
<S> assuming a dignified air , she turned round to debray , without answering her husband .: 100.08
<S> he will spoil the feast . i will direct him to stand behind your chair , and since he doesn t speak , your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles away . do you know , my friend , i find one thing very evident in all this , you distrust me . my lord , the day after to morrow is pentecost . well , what is pentecost to me ?: 79.84
<S> he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea ; doubtless these strange grave diggers had heard his cry .: 83.99
<S> you will not oppose m. villefort , you will not displease the marchioness , and tomorrow you will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband . but , mon dieu ! tell me , how can i do otherwise ? do not appeal to me , mademoiselle ; i shall be a bad judge in such a case ; my selfishness will blind me , replied morrel , whose low voice and clenched hands announced his growing <UNK> .: 73.99
<S> he thought of that young and pretty mme .: 55.21
<S> but the lady ? asked porthos .: 24.23
<S> porthos bowed to his friend .: 16.15
<S> so , you see , our papers were quickly written out , and certainly do not come very <UNK> . this joke elicited a fresh burst of applause .: 141.15
<S> the return to la rochelle , therefore , was profoundly dull .: 57.17
<S> it is my mistress you love ; you told me so just now . and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason ? the second reason , monsieur the chevalier , replied kitty , emboldened by the kiss in the first place , and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man , is that in love , everyone for herself ! then only d artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty , her constantly meeting him in the antechamber , the corridor , or on the stairs , those touches of the hand every time she met him , and her deep sighs ; but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady , he had disdained the soubrette .: 86.33
<S> patrick , said groslow , take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn .: 49.48
<S> at last , one day , when for the hundredth time i took up my spade , i asked myself again and again what the corsican could have done with the child .: 62.21
<S> ah ! said groslow .: 17.51
<S> the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys , such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock , and which thieves call <UNK> , doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt .: 372.89
<S> the three men brought the carriage up quietly , and took out of it a little man , stout , short , elderly , and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color , who ascended the ladder very carefully , looked suspiciously in at the window of the pavilion , came down as quietly as he had gone up , and whispered , it is she ! immediately , he who had spoken to me approached the door of the pavilion , opened it with a key he had in his hand , closed the door and disappeared , while at the same time the other two men ascended the ladder .: 73.17
<S> the workmen .: 73.05
<S> this time you shall not escape me ! neither is it my intention , monsieur , for this time i was seeking you ; in the name of the king , i arrest you . how !: 37.47
<S> i will go there , where i expect to find letters , and you go to the first tavern in the town , to l <UNK> du grand henri for instance , refresh yourselves , and in two hours be upon the jetty ; our boat is waiting for us there . the matter being thus decided , the two friends found , about two hundred paces further , the tavern indicated .: 123.08
<S> really impossible for a minister who has an office , agents , spies , and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money , to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of france !: 134.76
<S> certes , if the knife had been left in her power , she would now have thought , not of killing herself , but of killing the baron .: 66.90
<S> before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead ; and indeed , so convinced is he of this , that he entreated me , should i find your majesty disposed to act in this way , to do all i could to induce you to change your resolution . well , then , i will content myself with arresting you ! madame , the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen , and should i not have returned by to morrow , at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to paris and delivered to the parliament . it is evident , sir , that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs ; otherwise you would know that since we left paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times ; that he has there met de beaufort , de bouillon , the coadjutor and d elbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him . your pardon , madame , i know all that .: 70.74
<S> look ! and d artagnan , obliging athos to look in the direction he pointed , showed him the body of mordaunt floating on its back , which , sometimes <UNK> , sometimes rising , seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred .: 141.66
<S> and dauphine , sir ? inquired the king , of villefort .: 57.41
<S> i believe not ; nevertheless i believe she runs some great peril from which your grace alone can extricate her . i ! cried buckingham .: 136.67
<S> and then i also wish to see a notary , that i may be assured that all our property returns to valentine . ah , grandmamma , murmured valentine , pressing her lips on the burning brow , do you wish to kill me ?: 41.82
<S> the family began to get accustomed to their obscurity .: 90.66
<S> as soon as the enemy are within musket shot , we must fire upon them .: 93.46
<S> au revoir , albert .: 40.58
<S> the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards pe re lachaise from the faubourg saint honore .: 216.29
<S> the secret cave chapter 25 .: 95.29
<S> to morrow , according to all probability , we shall attack the enemy . but , my lord , said marshal de grammont , consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men . monsieur le marechal , said the prince , with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him , it is with small armies that great battles are won . then turning toward the prisoner , take away that man , he said , and keep him carefully in sight .: 77.84
<S> danglars turned to the left ; another man on horseback was galloping on that side .: 64.83
<S> he was a clever man .: 18.09
<S> porthos !: 41.73
<S> the <UNK> of the dew bathed the head of villefort , and refreshed his memory .: 127.55
<S> we have learnt nothing , forgotten nothing !: 176.40
<S> he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second , determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose .: 107.88
<S> dante s concealed two or three of the <UNK> fragments in his bed , leaving the rest on the floor .: 57.09
<S> sometimes , grimaud , who feared his master as he did fire , while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents , believed he perfectly understood what he wanted , flew to execute the order received , and did precisely the contrary .: 157.99
<S> the quick , eager glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended , while caderousse , on the contrary , turned his back , and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him .: 98.26
<S> he took her to his cha teau , and made her the first lady in the province ; and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becomingly . well ? asked d artagnan .: 59.64
<S> when his patience was exhausted , he called his valet .: 53.86
<S> good heavens !: 14.43
<S> they were listened to with great politeness by the duke , who held out hopes of easier measures , promised to speak in their behalf to the queen , and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty , we will see what we can do . two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their <UNK> addressed mazarin with so much <UNK> and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of orleans that he would see what could be done ; and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned .: 131.58
<S> the spectators saw the muskets leveled at them , and divided between fear and curiosity , remained noisy and excited .: 158.67
<S> wait an instant . and he pointed his gun at d artagnan , who was riding toward him at full speed .: 36.28
<S> it was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle ; he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back , and without <UNK> the reins he sprang from his box to open the door .: 82.88
<S> had he but waited till today , the price would have fallen to <UNK> , and instead of gaining 300,000 francs , he would have lost 20 or <UNK> and what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206 ? asked monte cristo .: 188.76
<S> well , everything was finished as you know .: 43.72
<S> i hope i am not the cause . hush , said andrea .: 22.18
<S> at his right hand was placed the superior of the jesuits , and on his left the curate of montdidier .: 40.21
<S> worthy fellows ! said morrel , as he went away , may your new master love you as i loved you , and be more fortunate than i have been ! <UNK> august rolled by in <UNK> efforts on the part of morrel to renew his credit or revive the old .: 176.00
<S> yes , but that would take too much time and i am thirsty .: 39.60
<S> you remind me , said the priest , that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond . said to bear the name ! repeated caderousse , becoming excited and eager .: 80.96
<S> franz , who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count , in which terror was strangely mingled , felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him , and therefore made no objection to albert s request , but at once accompanied him to the desired spot , and , after a short delay , the count joined them in the salon .: 114.75
<S> d artagnan followed him , and mousqueton , having closed the door , mounted behind the carriage with many groans .: 42.12
<S> please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses .: 267.32
<S> go . i will ask his servant . bonacieux re entered the house , passed through the same door that had afforded a passage for the two fugitives , went up to d artagnan s door , and knocked .: 52.38
<S> and i really don t know what prevents me from exterminating you all . alas , monseigneur , we were not in the plot , as you will soon see .: 69.53
<S> this order i believe i have accomplished with all the <UNK> of a soldier , but also with the courtesy of a gentleman .: 63.05
<S> in one the queen asked for the ornaments back again .: 126.49
<S> ah , that , said the prince , i understand that language thoroughly ; and since he is italian i will myself continue the examination .: 76.85
<S> as to d artagnan , he fought purely and simply on the defensive ; and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued , with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword flying .: 116.65
<S> you are strong among the strong , mordaunt , he said ; and the frenchmen , how did they behave ? most fearlessly . yes , yes , murmured cromwell ; the french fight well ; and if my glass was good and i mistake not , they were foremost in the fight . they were , replied mordaunt .: 107.23
<S> does your excellency wish me to accompany him ? no , the coachman , ali , and baptistin will go . the count descended to the door of his mansion , and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars .: 52.57
<S> at the same time , aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon a superb english charger .: 41.23
<S> the daily renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed , had alone kept him in the service of a musketeer a service in which , he said , his soul was in constant <UNK> .: 89.17
<S> about five minutes , replied the captain .: 20.49
<S> what have we all done , then , dear grandpapa ? said valentine ; you no longer seem to love any of us ? the old man s eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife , and rested on valentine with a look of unutterable fondness .: 48.87
<S> what do you fear ? everything ! replied athos .: 17.12
<S> you have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me . this , too , was the opinion of comminges , who withdrew somewhat reassured .: 46.96
<S> be philosophers , as i am , gentlemen ; sit down at the table and let us drink .: 47.33
<S> at the foot of the staircase de winter stopped .: 18.39
<S> what new <UNK> is that ? he says he is german , my lord , replied raoul ; but i doubt it , for his accent is bad and his <UNK> defective . then you speak german , also ? asked the prince .: 86.09
<S> sir , replied comminges , it seems that it is impossible . monsieur de comminges , said athos , i have been a soldier all my life and i know the force of orders ; but outside your orders there is a service you can render me . i will do it with all my heart , said comminges ; for i know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty ; i know , too , how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a broussel was arrested .: 66.65
<S> that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere .: 136.78
<S> long life to his eminence !: 150.06
<S> one day he carried off a young girl , the daughter of a <UNK> of frosinone .: 61.84
<S> some workmen must have fallen underneath them and been hurt . aramis shuddered in spite of himself .: 126.64
<S> i am in possession of all my senses , sir , he said ; my body alone suffers , as you may suppose .: 42.55
<S> i , married ? exclaimed monte cristo , shuddering ; who could have told you so ? no one told me you were , but you have frequently been seen at the opera with a young and lovely woman . she is a slave whom i bought at constantinople , madame , the daughter of a prince .: 43.25
<S> i have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention , i believe , of making me a soldier ; and he gave me reason to hope that at paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince . yes , i understand it well .: 48.34
<S> and now , said the unknown , farewell kindness , humanity , and gratitude !: 94.52
<S> i can not throw the loop through this partition nor move with a pack thread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred pounds . no , but you can take out two or three boards of the partition , answered blaisois , and make a hole in the cask with a gimlet . mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost , astonished to find in blaisois qualities for which he did not give him credit .: 142.32
<S> but we know very well what had become of edmond .: 29.56
<S> well ? you are right ; it is more difficult than i thought .: 17.09
<S> monsieur and dear friend ah , yes !: 71.99
<S> amuse yourself well ! replied bonacieux , in a sepulchral tone .: 52.98

<S> and i , who have answered for him to the queen i , who have promised my poor mistress ah , my god , my god !: 35.08
<S> the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness .: 114.74
<S> a certain emotion , for which he could not account , made the lieutenant s heart beat : he had no longer the assurance of youth ; experience had taught him the importance of past events .: 123.15
<S> the fact was that none of his servants , none of the travelers present , could have gained anything by being possessed of this paper .: 109.63
<S> in a dungeon . which ? good lord !: 76.42
<S> the old man s interrogative eye said , which ? i will go , continued maximilian , i will seek m. franz d e pinay i am happy to be able to mention this in mademoiselle de villefort s absence and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me . noirtier s look continued to interrogate .: 69.73
<S> the joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal it .: 54.18
<S> farewell , my son , said the curate , till tomorrow . till tomorrow , rash youth , said the jesuit .: 48.03
<S> d artagnan shows himself as athos and porthos had foreseen , at the expiration of a half hour , d artagnan returned .: 24.13

<S> there were no questions .: 27.60
<S> journeys , you know , appear much shorter when we travel two in company . have you no friends in paris , then , monsieur porthos ? said the procurator s wife .: 67.83
<S> everything in its proper time , and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently .: 124.43
<S> everything appeared as usual the precious secretaire in its place , and the key in the secretaire .: 123.03
<S> she had only one day left .: 50.06
<S> it was a frightful thing to see this wretch , leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over , pale with approaching death , trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice , which lay twenty paces from him .: 78.70
<S> the breakfast for these gentlemen is ready , said the host .: 36.67
<S> the traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink , and then pointed to his horse and <UNK> like a man who is brushing something .: 55.53
<S> i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you , as i shared yours at rome i , who do not profess egotism , but am yet egotist par excellence ; for , except myself , these rooms would not hold a shadow more , unless that shadow were feminine . ah , said the count , that is a most conjugal <UNK> ; i recollect that at rome you said something of a projected marriage .: 204.62
<S> and he caused himself to be announced to the minister .: 35.51
<S> during this passage , felton related everything to milady how , instead of going to london , he had <UNK> the little vessel ; how he had returned ; how he had <UNK> the wall by fastening <UNK> in the interstices of the stones , as he ascended , to give him <UNK> ; and how , when he had reached the bars , he fastened his ladder .: 110.91
<S> you know you may say anything to me .: 31.15
<S> as to you , comrades , they said to the men , nothing will happen to you if you are discreet ; but if you stir you are dead men . the soldiers were complaisant ; they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it .: 95.08
<S> come , father added dante s , put this money back in your box unless neighbor caderousse wants anything , and in that case it is at his service . no , my boy , no , said caderousse .: 101.29
<S> i think so , indeed ; we should be hard to please if we were not .: 29.23
<S> that time you had nothing to say to me ; i had risked my life and favor to see you but for a second .: 41.95
<S> there only they explained to them the matter in hand .: 108.91
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> this day will be a warm one , said planchet , in a warlike tone .: 38.17
<S> d artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere .: 26.32
<S> i did not come to rome to see , said danglars aloud ; then he added softly , with an avaricious smile , i came to touch ! and he rapped his pocket book , in which he had just placed a letter .: 69.53
<S> good ! mazarin was in his study , working at a list of pensions and <UNK> , of which he was trying to reduce the number .: 109.82
<S> five minutes later he was in the rue des fossoyeurs .: 9.26
<S> what ?: 20.58
<S> at this moment two women entered , bringing <UNK> filled with ices and sherbet , which they placed on two small <UNK> appropriated to that purpose .: 226.77
<S> stop , said albert , here he comes .: 25.36
<S> of what consequence ? replied milady .: 24.90
<S> teresa had yielded in spite of herself , but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man , she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him .: 41.70
<S> no . well , i shall see him to morrow and tell him about you ; but i m afraid , entre <UNK> , that his liking for wine has aged and degraded him . yes , he used to drink a great deal , replied porthos .: 95.05
<S> well ! answered the boy , the thing is done . where is he gone ? the half pistole is for me ? doubtless , answer me . i want to see it .: 64.69
<S> would not m. noirtier also have fallen a victim , had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years <UNK> the effects of the poison ? oh , heaven , said valentine ; is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month ? and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor , like that of dried orange <UNK> ? oh , yes , yes ! then that explains all , said monte cristo .: 112.90
<S> he is very young ; but a sword thrust is a sword thrust , whatever be the age of him who gives it , and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man , and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes .: 92.65
<S> yes . i know it because yesterday monsieur de wardes , in a saloon where i was , showed a ring which he said he had received from you . wretch ! cried milady .: 61.82
<S> so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose <UNK> glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence .: 442.76
<S> he was , in fact , in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice ; the finger of god once pointed at him , everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry .: 166.39
<S> no matter .: 36.01
<S> let us draw lots !: 39.61
<S> she raised her head with an effort .: 20.58
<S> yes , yes , replied dante s eagerly ; i would beg of you , who see so completely to the depths of things , and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy <UNK> , to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination , was never brought to trial , and , above all , was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me ? that is altogether a different and more serious matter , responded the abbe .: 106.05
<S> the treasure , if it existed , was buried in this corner .: 58.36
<S> you are included in the <UNK> , fernand , and are only at liberty on <UNK> , liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms .: 151.80
<S> will , said the notary ; it is very evident that m. noirtier is desirous of making his will . yes , yes , yes , motioned the invalid .: 28.15
<S> diable ! a pallor overspread the young man s forehead , and he looked around him with anxiety .: 35.38
<S> andrea was supported by two priests .: 42.54
<S> d artagnan has turned aside from buckingham , whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved , the tempest with which richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen .: 134.49
<S> they reached the building , ornamented with magnificent fruits , which <UNK> at the beginning of july in the artificial <UNK> which takes the place of the sun , so frequently absent in our <UNK> .: 167.51
<S> he was accompanied by two of the yacht s crew .: 43.96
<S> you should recognize him among a thousand , say you ? continued he .: 77.11
<S> rich ?: 388.94
<S> are you one of us , monsieur de rochefort ? i am very desirous of being so , my lord , but i am totally in the dark about everything .: 38.61
<S> well , cried his auditors ; at the moment you left his house ? aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort , like a man who , in the full relation of a falsehood , finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle ; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him , their ears were wide open , and there were no means of retreat .: 72.00
<S> cries of death !: 54.91
<S> what have you done with her , then , if you have her no longer ? they have abducted her , monsieur . they have abducted her ?: 41.41
<S> he turned towards noirtier ; the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased .: 101.28
<S> the <UNK> of <UNK> chapter <UNK> .: 370.92
<S> he did as he said .: 33.51
<S> he saw before him an officer delegated to <UNK> the law , and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf , as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy .: 266.30
<S> be careful of your life , which is menaced , and which will be dear to me from the moment i am not obliged to see an enemy in you .: 57.29
<S> morcerf had expected he should be the guide ; on the contrary , it was he who , under the count s <UNK> , followed a course of arch ology , mineralogy , and natural history .: 92.29
<S> i could not tell you before others , said he in a low tone , the reason of my parting with the horses ; but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them .: 72.57
<S> now i can promise you , that a frenchman might show himself in public , either in tunis , constantinople , bagdad , or cairo , without being treated in that way . that shows that the eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects <UNK> of either .: 216.63
<S> the cardinal trusted him , and therein found his advantage .: 137.43
<S> it is not aramis ! cried he .: 13.72
<S> the queen had at first positively refused ; but at length became afraid that the duke , if exasperated , would commit some folly .: 156.21
<S> mazarin was a <UNK> at the card table .: 169.57
<S> your hand , dante s !: 28.19
<S> besides , my friend d artagnan has something to say to me privately , have you not , d artagnan ? d artagnan nodded his head and bazin retired , after placing on the table the spanish wine .: 52.10
<S> the lantern was placed on the ground , the two adversaries took their stations , and the duel began .: 45.69
<S> you know the rest .: 22.20
<S> he took monte cristo aside .: 35.42
<S> the two cavalcanti bowed to the count , and left the house .: 18.45
<S> i will call salvieux and make him write the letter . be as quick as possible , i must be on the road in a quarter of an hour . tell your coachman to stop at the door . you will present my excuses to the marquise and mademoiselle rene e , whom i leave on such a day with great regret . you will find them both here , and can make your farewells in person . a thousand thanks and now for the letter . the marquis rang , a servant entered .: 68.46
<S> to tell the truth , count , if i knew less of you , i should think that you were less brave than you are . because i sigh when thinking of someone i am leaving ?: 62.09
<S> what is there astonishing in that ? and you had no other object in coming to england but to see me ? no . so it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the channel ? for you alone . the deuce !: 60.20
<S> he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat .: 20.99
<S> the bearers went on for twenty paces , then stopped , putting the bier down on the ground .: 67.33
<S> and what favor , pray ? asked lord de winter .: 24.68
<S> oh , unhappy woman ! cried the commissary .: 21.81
<S> d artagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau .: 24.61
<S> why to me ? why , you killed him !: 38.12
<S> can you enlighten me on that point ? i do not know who could if i could not , said caderousse .: 37.29
<S> besides , it is important , added he in a low tone , that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper . ah , you are a good and an excellent friend , said albert ; yes , you are right ; watch , watch , beauchamp , and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure . albert and beauchamp parted , the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger .: 54.79
<S> in two bounds he was at the louvre ; as he entered the wicket of l echelle , ten o clock struck .: 60.64
<S> then three or four shots were fired .: 26.06
<S> now , sir , said monte cristo , addressing andrea , make your confession . to whom ? tell m. cavalcanti something of the state of your finances . ma foi ! monsieur , you have touched upon a tender chord . do you hear what he says , major ? certainly i do . but do you understand ? i do . your son says he requires money . well , what would you have me do ? said the major .: 42.03
<S> so dressed , he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom .: 131.21
<S> don t make a bad use of it , i entreat you .: 32.30
<S> the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk , trimmed with steel buttons , beautifully cut and polished .: 144.35
<S> he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep , which was very annoying to him , when d artagnan , instead of explaining , closed his mouth with his hand .: 59.81
<S> but how comes the diamond in your possession , sir ?: 42.37
<S> tell them , said morrel in a hoarse voice , tell them that i am her betrothed .: 25.20
<S> she has a carriage , then , this niece of the doctor ? interrupted porthos , one of whose faults was a great <UNK> of tongue .: 112.46
<S> where is there any to be found ? i can show you , answered the gascon .: 31.19
<S> that s a different thing ; yes , i know there are <UNK> of that sort , said comminges .: 52.64
<S> i , who have a <UNK> at cairo , one at smyrna , and one at constantinople , preside at a wedding ? never ! then you refuse me ? decidedly ; and were you my son or my brother i would refuse you in the same way . but what must be done ? said andrea , disappointed .: 77.54
<S> stop a minute ah , this is it : <UNK> <UNK> et <UNK> <UNK> , which means , beware of the enemy who makes you presents . this diamond does not come from an enemy , monsieur , replied d artagnan , it comes from the queen . from the queen !: 147.55
<S> at this moment the expiring <UNK> threw up a fresh flame from the <UNK> of a piece of wood that lay near , and a bright light flashed over the room .: 83.05
<S> are you satisfied , sir ? continued the notary , addressing the old man .: 10.22
<S> traitors ! screamed lord winter , whose voice they heard , whilst his men , quitting their ranks , dispersed all over the plain .: 166.24
<S> italy : sinbad the sailor towards the beginning of the year <UNK> , two young men belonging to the first society of paris , the viscount albert de morcerf and the baron franz d e pinay , were at florence .: 79.65
<S> the king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him .: 13.68
<S> my dear friend , said the baroness , while the two young people were shaking hands , i and euge nie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince cavalcanti . danglars kept up the title of prince .: 51.06
<S> by this smile m. de tre ville judged that he had not to deal with a fool , and changing the conversation , came straight to the point .: 41.07
<S> she then turned to the right , followed the course of a long corridor , descended a flight , went a few steps farther , introduced a key into a lock , opened a door , and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp , saying , remain here , my lord duke ; someone will come . she then went out by the same door , which she locked , so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner .: 67.01
<S> the night was dark , but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege .: 119.00
<S> now this is not all , he said ; you can not live upon your fifteen thousand francs . i shall still have my place . no , you will lose it , for you are going to alter your correspondent s message . oh , sir , what are you proposing ? a jest . sir , unless you force me i think i can effectually force you ; and monte cristo drew another packet from his pocket .: 46.37
<S> well , said he , when franz had concluded , what do you find to object to in all you have related ?: 46.56
<S> indeed , my dear friend , said beauchamp first , who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation , allow me to congratulate you ; this is a very unhoped for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair . albert remained silent and wrapped in thought .: 97.92
<S> leave us alone , then , and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to yourselves . gentlemen , said jussac , it is with great regret that i pronounce the thing impossible .: 74.62
<S> dante s seized the handles , and strove to lift the coffer ; it was impossible .: 49.23
<S> i have <UNK> francs remaining , he said .: 97.78
<S> the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear , for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel , as an object of god s anger . ah , indeed ? said monte cristo , looking earnestly at the young man , and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair , so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on maximilian s face .: 81.46
<S> the lackeys on their part , like the <UNK> of <UNK> , shared the sadness of their masters .: 94.58
<S> the count never plays , he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry , and is so rich that he can not , without intending to laugh at me , try to borrow money .: 188.34
<S> i have seen the bastille .: 26.67
<S> monsieur , said the cardinal , are you a d artagnan from be arn ? yes , monseigneur , replied the young man .: 14.70
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> far from here ? asked athos .: 55.23
<S> i landed here , regulated the affairs of the vessel , and hastened to visit my affianced bride , whom i found more lovely than ever .: 80.97
<S> to grief succeeded rage .: 960.12
<S> albert led him first to his atelier , which was , as we have said , his favorite apartment .: 50.89
<S> well , what have i learned since ?: 30.56
<S> what is such or such a prince to us , who fixed the <UNK> upon a great queen s head ?: 123.04
<S> it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silver mounted wand he <UNK> was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshal s baton which conde threw , or did not throw , into the enemy s line of battle at fribourg .: 204.78
<S> remain , sir , he added to aramis , who had moved to leave the room .: 26.79
<S> there was no peculiar indication in any organ an excitement of the nervous system that was it ; a case of <UNK> congestion nothing more .: 309.99
<S> think , if i am found out here , the people of the house , who have not seen me enter it , will take me for a thief . true , said d artagnan .: 34.97
<S> the demands in that programme must be granted . we were almost agreed on those , replied mazarin ; let us pass on to private and personal <UNK> . you suppose , then , that there are some ? said aramis , smiling .: 93.83
<S> has he not already forgotten she ever existed ?: 105.27
<S> bonacieux , who willingly took it , half laughing , half trembling , and both gained the top of rue de la harpe .: 133.26
<S> nevertheless , isolated as he was , we must say that the duke of buckingham did not experience an instant of fear .: 42.26
<S> the ghost of former greatness .: 233.66
<S> what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit , ruin , or <UNK> , and level their pieces at you ? eh , parbleu ! they should kill me . the innkeeper turned to franz with an air that seemed to say , your friend is decidedly mad . my dear albert , returned franz , your answer is sublime , and worthy the let him die , of <UNK> , only , when horace made that answer , the safety of rome was concerned ; but , as for us , it is only to gratify a whim , and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive . albert poured himself out a glass of <UNK> christi , which he sipped at intervals , muttering some unintelligible words .: 132.89
<S> i used all my influence with one of the committee , a young peer of my acquaintance , to get admission to one of the <UNK> .: 72.96
<S> tell them oh , tell them , that corpse belongs to me ! the young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish , fell heavily on his knees before the bed , which his fingers grasped with convulsive energy .: 73.35
<S> bonacieux , with a half smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience .: 89.64
<S> suddenly d artagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even porthos observed ; but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before .: 101.92
<S> they still hesitated an instant ; but , as before , pride prevailed , and a second kick split the door from bottom to top .: 152.25
<S> d aguillon , his mistress , and mme .: 59.41
<S> a war of partisans , unworthy of a king . the example of robert <UNK> will absolve you , sire . no , no !: 165.76
<S> the young man remained immovable .: 17.97
<S> they soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one , who remained at the shore to their fire , at which the carcass of a goat was roasting .: 130.64
<S> and yet their natural disposition revealed itself .: 206.44
<S> soon , as the road turned , the chateau de la valliere appeared in view ; then , a quarter of a mile beyond , a white house , encircled in sycamores , was visible at the farther end of a group of trees , which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers .: 89.99
<S> i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthy that of being the husband of merce de s. nay , nay ! cried caderousse , smiling , you have not attained that honor yet .: 89.15
<S> why , it seems to me , replied morrel , that in delivering m. de morcerf , whom you did not know , you did good to your neighbor and to society . of which he is the brightest ornament , said beauchamp , drinking off a glass of champagne .: 66.45
<S> in fact , after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread , charles , weary of waiting for death , had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for movement .: 76.93
<S> have i not explained your wishes , grandpapa ? said valentine , addressing noirtier .: 35.93
<S> this website includes information about project gutenberg , including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation , how to help produce our new ebooks , and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks .: 72.62
<S> it is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin .: 63.43
<S> could you have believed such a thing possible ? why , you know i told you , replied danglars , that i considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the island of elba as a very suspicious circumstance . and did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself ? <UNK> certainly not ! returned danglars .: 85.76
<S> because , as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us , he took him for the chief , said d artagnan .: 35.39
<S> gentlemen , return your swords to their scabbards . well , provided you replace your pistols in your belt . willingly . and d artagnan set the example .: 77.53
<S> milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury , screaming in a formidable way .: 174.92
<S> mazarin wrote a few words , which he gave to this man ; then he bowed .: 34.35
<S> he thought a moment , cut a branch of a <UNK> tree , lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast , and descended with this torch .: 96.15
<S> from the time d artagnan took quarters in that hotel , the mistress of the house , a pretty and fresh looking flemish woman , twenty five or twenty six years old , had been singularly interested in him ; and after certain love passages , much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times d artagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body , that husband had disappeared one fine morning , after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine , carrying away with him money and jewels .: 202.86
<S> the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund .: 79.85
<S> you are discreet so much the better .: 48.34
<S> coquenard smiled , and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat .: 77.01
<S> i love that humiliation , i , who am master of the universe , as was <UNK> . but where are you really going ? to sea , viscount ; you know i am a sailor .: 74.76
<S> justice before everything . then turning toward m. de tre ville and walking with him toward the embrasure of a window , well , monsieur , continued he , you say it is his eminence s guards who have sought a quarrel with your musketeers ? yes , sire , as they always do . and how did the thing happen ?: 52.82
<S> if i had anything by means of which i could <UNK> the lungs , said d avrigny , looking around him , perhaps i might prevent suffocation .: 85.85
<S> the door soon opened and the accused appeared .: 38.81
<S> certainly , you must give the orders , for i intend residing at the house . <UNK> it was <UNK> for a servant of the count s to dare to dispute an order of his , so the steward , without saying a word , followed his master , who got into the carriage , and signed to him to follow , which he did , taking his place respectfully on the front seat .: 79.11
<S> adieu , my dear cousin .: 24.19
<S> yes , i was expected , and very impatiently , i acknowledge . a slight shade passed over the brow of bonacieux , but so slight that d artagnan did not perceive it .: 39.54
<S> i have begun a poem in verses of one syllable .: 165.18
<S> you appear as unhappy as i am the reverse . yes , truly , dear friend ; and i may even say the sight of you increases my dismay . and de winter glancing around him , raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room <UNK> .: 87.53
<S> but i know you to be a man of honor . the count again struck the gong .: 28.59
<S> i , replied the gascon , i believe in devotion as a word at one s baptism , for instance , which naturally comes before one s proper name ; every one is naturally more or less devout , certainly ; but there should be at the end of one s devotion something to gain . and your friend , for instance ; what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion ? well , my lord , my friend has three magnificent estates : that of vallon , at corbeil ; that of bracieux , in the <UNK> ; and that of pierrefonds , in the <UNK> .: 104.32
<S> i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence .: 647.06
<S> athos ? said she ; wait a moment . and she placed her hands on her brow , as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to <UNK> in a moment .: 61.72
<S> everybody talked at once , without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts .: 101.11
<S> his assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majesty s window the cry we heard was his and there is no executioner nearer at hand than bristol . but the comte de la fere ? asked the king .: 196.98
<S> you have some in the house , have you not ? yes . send for some oil of <UNK> and tartar emetic . villefort immediately despatched a messenger .: 142.39
<S> i have done all in my power to <UNK> them and yet the belief of the public , you say , is that they proceed from me , an unhappy foreigner , who has been unable to please the french .: 69.15
<S> winter s regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp .: 229.95
<S> bonacieux , starting .: 62.98
<S> gracious me ! said porthos , there s phoebus ruined . the cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles . i m above that . let us set out again , at full gallop . yes , if we can . but at last the lieutenant s horse refused to go on ; he could not breathe ; one last spur , instead of making him advance , made him fall .: 63.97
<S> dinner was waiting , but as albert had told him that he should not return so soon , franz sat down without him .: 43.14
<S> well ? asked peppino of his friend .: 28.60
<S> are you coming , morrel ? directly i have given my card to the count , who has promised to pay us a visit at rue meslay , no .: 71.64
<S> you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary , compressed , marked up , nonproprietary or proprietary form , including any word processing or hypertext form .: 44.89
<S> after a short time , the count saw bertuccio , who , until then , had been occupied on the other side of the house , glide into an adjoining room .: 29.76
<S> decidedly , you are a brave fellow , said athos , pressing the young man s hand .: 13.84
<S> at the bottom of that staircase lies , probably , the cardinal s treasury of which folk tell such wonders , and we should only have to descend , empty a chest , shut the cardinal up in it , double lock it , go away , carrying off as much gold as we could , put back this orange tree over the place , and no one in the world would ever ask us where our fortune came from not even the cardinal . it would be a happy hit for clowns to make , but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said porthos .: 172.78
<S> thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it . the devil it does !: 134.54
<S> what is his name ? said he .: 6.09
<S> how much ? asked danglars .: 12.61
<S> what say you , morrel ! ma foi , he has an open look about him that pleases me , in spite of the singular remark he has made about me . gentlemen , said albert , germain informs me that breakfast is ready .: 81.68
<S> the clerks surveyed him with great curiosity , and he , not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale , remained tongue tied .: 286.50
<S> the procurator s wife waited tremblingly .: 56.50
<S> beauchamp is a worthy fellow , said monte cristo , when the journalist was gone ; is he not , albert ? yes , and a sincere friend ; i love him devotedly .: 46.16
<S> and now , i am a frondeur not of broussel s party , nor of blancmesnil s , nor am i with viole ; but with the duc de beaufort , the ducs de bouillon and d elbeuf ; with princes , not with <UNK> , councillors and low born lawyers .: 164.42
<S> the two things agree marvelously well . i am all attention , said d artagnan .: 62.14
<S> but then all this <UNK> is not for myself , added athos , laughing .: 66.92
<S> there s no second constance in the world . on his return to the cathedral , d artagnan saw bazin , who was conversing with the <UNK> .: 55.86
<S> the young man was overwhelmed as he read .: 21.05
<S> hang it ! said porthos .: 18.46
<S> yet one wants some one besides you for that , my fine king s <UNK> !: 257.84
<S> give him a lesson , debray . stay , said beauchamp , surely i am not deceived . what is it ? it is she ! whom do you mean ? they said she had left . mademoiselle euge nie ? said cha teau renaud ; has she returned ? no , but her mother . madame danglars ?: 43.06
<S> leave your hold , then , i beg of you , and let me go where my business calls me . monsieur , said athos , letting him go , you are not polite ; it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance . d artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs , but at athos s last remark he stopped short .: 45.61
<S> m. danglars is my banker ; m. de villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a <UNK> piece of good fortune enabled me to render him .: 105.08
<S> do you know , m. andrea , i think you have managed this affair rather skilfully ? not badly , by any means , said the young man ; i was born for a diplomatist . well , you must become a diplomatist ; diplomacy , you know , is something that is not to be acquired ; it is instinctive .: 57.10
<S> let us know when breakfast is ready .: 49.40
<S> i say your troops , for i presume that you gentlemen are frondeurs ? yes , almost , said aramis .: 63.86
<S> but you need not fear .: 30.78
<S> her eyes , raised towards heaven , were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure , its form that of a shadow mounting towards heaven .: 145.70
<S> they passed through two rooms , furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of signor pastrini , and were shown into an elegantly fitted up drawing room .: 125.14
<S> then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes , and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him .: 57.92
<S> there you stood , <UNK> , stupefied , annihilated .: 256.62
<S> answer ! that is the very truth , cried the mercer ; but monsieur does not tell you silence , with respect to me , silence , with respect to my friends ; silence about the queen , above all , or you will ruin everybody without saving yourself !: 90.80
<S> yes , in italy ; it was in italy most probably , replied monte cristo ; you have travelled then in italy , mademoiselle ? yes ; madame and i were there two years ago .: 57.76
<S> he was an italian and therefore superstitious .: 75.14
<S> tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love , which had your mother s sanction .: 82.75
<S> surely , said albert , as the door of a box on the first circle opened , that must be the countess g . and who is the countess g ? inquired cha teau renaud .: 30.94
<S> she did not know what might take place during this night which approached so <UNK> for large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky , and distant lightning announced a storm .: 179.51
<S> to your house , dear porthos , at pierrefonds ; your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence ; it is , likewise , well situated neither too near paris , nor too far from it ; we can establish a communication between it and the capital with great facility .: 199.70
<S> the pope is the successor of st. peter , and represents the three divine powers ; the rest <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> bless in the name of the holy <UNK> and angels .: 419.18
<S> what is the prisoner doing ? inquired vampa of the sentinel .: 29.17
<S> women !: 70.29
<S> all at once , in a narrow pass , they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone .: 66.30
<S> sir , cried parry , may you and yours be blessed ! how can it be ? repeated the king .: 40.02
<S> on his side buckingham , in pretending to maintain the honor of england , was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal .: 132.77
<S> m. de tre ville had spoken of her to the queen .: 12.69
<S> a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing room , and went to open the door himself .: 17.64
<S> bonacieux .: 14.79
<S> it was useless to search at night , and dante s therefore delayed all investigation until the morning .: 107.02
<S> danglars , hidden behind a curtain , watched the departure he had been waiting for .: 72.56
<S> if you are not located in the united states , you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this ebook .: 10.33
<S> besides , you must have seen that the person to whom i spoke was a woman . that is true ; but this woman is a friend of aramis i know nothing of that . since she lodges with him . that does not concern me . but who is she ? oh , that is not my secret . my dear madame bonacieux , you are charming ; but at the same time you are one of the most mysterious women . do i lose by that ? no ; you are , on the contrary , adorable . give me your arm , then . most willingly .: 30.87
<S> listen , my dear friend ; in two words you will know all .: 29.26
<S> neither merce de s nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance ; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other .: 67.91
<S> you will take their places and i shall not lose by the exchange .: 52.55
<S> then , answered the elder prisoner , the will of god be done ! and as the old man slowly pronounced those words , an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance .: 100.87
<S> how does it happen , then , that he is in your service ? he has been guilty of certain <UNK> and fears he may be disturbed . and the musketeer narrated to his friend planchet s adventure .: 54.92
<S> dead , dead ! repeated he within himself ; and he felt as if he were also dying .: 64.28
<S> i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do , m. danglars , in promoting a new railway line ; you , m. de villefort , in condemning a culprit to death ; you , m. debray , in <UNK> a kingdom ; you , m. de cha teau renaud , in pleasing a woman ; and you , morrel , in breaking a horse that no one can ride .: 100.53
<S> i demand admittance , said a loud voice outside the room , in the name of the law ! as no attempt was made to prevent it , the door was opened , and a magistrate , wearing his official scarf , presented himself , followed by four soldiers and a corporal .: 85.54
<S> at the first word , before i had even mentioned your father s name ah , said he .: 50.30
<S> ah , pardieu ! he exclaimed ; that would be fair play . and approaching the carriage , he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box .: 52.67
<S> there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand , with its sides bordered by tall , meagre trees , altogether presenting so <UNK> an appearance , that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller , at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying , would choose to expose himself in such a formidable <UNK> .: 323.04
<S> thy god shall teach thee to repent !: 333.28
<S> i have known him for ten years , the last four of which he was in my service .: 32.15
<S> yes , said the duke , but take care , my dear la ramee , for i propose to beat you badly . la ramee went out .: 28.23
<S> from time to time , by the light of the moon , which began to rise , franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins , and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino .: 76.36
<S> i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give you . yes . and by accustoming her to that poison , you have endeavored to <UNK> the effect of a similar poison ? noirtier s joy continued .: 126.51
<S> thanks , my brave friend ! cried milady ; and when shall i be avenged ? tomorrow immediately when you please ! milady was about to cry out , immediately , but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward d artagnan .: 54.58
<S> absolution . tell me her name and i will give it . her name was my god , have pity on me ! murmured the executioner ; and he fell back on the bed , pale , trembling , and apparently about to die .: 38.07
<S> you are safe you are free . mazarin replied only by a groan ; he could not believe in such a miracle .: 42.28
<S> morrel took the purse , and started as he did so , for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself .: 59.40
<S> that very day the miners began their labors , with a vigor and alacrity <UNK> to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of <UNK> success .: 383.45
<S> acting by my advice , my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto , who was continually <UNK> her for money , as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession .: 111.42
<S> what shall we do ?: 14.61
<S> the accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed .: 98.27
<S> lord de winter arrived at the appointed time ; but athos , being warned of his coming , went into the other chamber .: 35.50
<S> read , she said .: 21.27
<S> milady gazed with all the power of her attention ; it was just light enough for her to see who was coming .: 54.17
<S> there ! said d artagnan , we can t be overtaken .: 18.22
<S> i offer my best respects and services to you , my lord . d artagnan then , returning to the officer , said : sir , have the kindness also to awaken monsieur du vallon and to say tis by his eminence s order , and that i shall await him at the stables . the officer went off with an eagerness that showed the gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter .: 44.89
<S> lean upon me , and let us return to the camp . yes , said the man , who could scarcely believe in such <UNK> , but is it not to have me hanged ? you have my word , said he ; for the second time i give you your life . the wounded man sank upon his knees , to again kiss the feet of his preserver ; but d artagnan , who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy , abridged the <UNK> of his gratitude .: 52.40
<S> prison had made edmond prudent , and he was desirous of running no risk whatever .: 191.58
<S> no false generosity , count !: 219.16
<S> the last spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter .: 81.09
<S> cromwell s letter .: 93.16
<S> now , since the affair of nordlingen , they had experienced nothing but reverses ; the parliament had a plea for calling mazarin to account for imaginary victories , always promised , ever deferred ; but this time there really had been fighting , a triumph and a complete one .: 258.53
<S> hola , mousqueton , seats , and order double the bottles ! do you know what we are eating here ? said athos , at the end of ten minutes .: 48.73
<S> the gascon gave a last <UNK> to his mustache , a last turn to his hair , brushed , from habit , the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet , and went downstairs .: 117.25
<S> speak , my friend ; i listen . there is not a hope , replied faria , shaking his head , but no matter ; god wills it that man whom he has created , and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life , should do all in his power to preserve that existence , which , however painful it may be , is yet always so dear . oh , yes , yes ! exclaimed dante s ; and i tell you that i will save you yet . well , then , try .: 53.13
<S> for his father s death he was in some manner prepared ; but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of merce de s .: 42.05
<S> at this exclamation his adversary bounded back and , bending his bare head , tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant .: 89.06
<S> i don t care to be shot in a box . no , said aramis , he has not seen us .: 24.86
<S> fatality ! he muttered .: 18.98
<S> if she had not yet taken any repose , he at least was already up .: 52.94
<S> franz and the count got into the carriage .: 25.40
<S> that will do , said he ; leave the rest to me . will the petition go soon ? today . countersigned by you ? the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition . and , sitting down , villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom .: 106.20
<S> and the other ? which ? the short one . oh , he was not a gentleman , i ll answer for it ; besides , he did not wear a sword , and the others treated him with small consideration . some lackey , murmured d artagnan .: 60.04
<S> what are you meddling with , stupid ?: 104.01
<S> rochefort ! he exclaimed ; you !: 32.52
<S> i should tell you that we lived in the little village of rogliano , at the extremity of cap <UNK> .: 80.97
<S> they had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their inquiries .: 179.21
<S> what are you about ? asked d artagnan .: 6.63
<S> grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech , but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge , announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort .: 93.43
<S> that we are not able to say ; but at all events , we have seen , by the anterior developments of this story , that buckingham had the advantage over him , and in two or three circumstances , particularly that of the diamond studs , had , thanks to the devotedness of the three musketeers and the courage and conduct of d artagnan , cruelly <UNK> him .: 62.54
<S> now , sir , continued morrel , in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance , even were she not a young , beautiful , and adorable creature like valentine .: 109.50
<S> yes , continued his eminence ; under certain circumstances , with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses , aided by your friends , you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary . i ! said the queen .: 92.22
<S> to morrow i plunge into an adventurous affair in which i may be killed .: 115.48
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> stay , said monte cristo , as though he had not observed her confusion , i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds . i have none nor have i ever possessed any ; but really we have talked long enough of money , count , we are like two stockbrokers ; have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor <UNK> ? what has happened ? said the count , <UNK> total ignorance .: 139.19
<S> why do you call me baron ? said danglars ; you know that i care nothing for my title .: 33.34
<S> gentlemen , i have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the red dovecot .: 42.93
<S> the comte de la fere ! she cried .: 8.12
<S> think often of raoul .: 275.80
<S> none of the lads of pampinara , palestrina , or <UNK> had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion .: 135.27
<S> with the four hundred livres we will make the half of one for one of the <UNK> , and then we will give the <UNK> out of our pockets to d artagnan , who has a steady hand , and will go and play in the first gaming house we come to .: 84.44
<S> pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent , he fixed his terrified eye on the <UNK> sufferer .: 78.57
<S> well , the man whom i offer you is a general syndic . and what do you know of him ? nothing , my lord , except that he is tormented with remorse . what makes you think so ? on the twenty eighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death ; yesterday i said this mass again . and his name ? maillard ; but i do not think it is his right one . and think you that we should find him at this hour at his post ? certainly . let us go and see your beggar , sir , and if he is such as you describe him , you are right it will be you who have discovered the true treasure . gondy dressed himself as an officer , put on a felt cap with a red feather , hung on a long sword , buckled spurs to his boots , wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate .: 73.63
<S> now when evening came dante s put his plate on the ground near the door ; the jailer , as he entered , stepped on it and broke it .: 59.37
<S> and now , farewell . farewell , saintly , <UNK> majesty , <UNK> athos , chilled with terror .: 362.15
<S> i knew that , said monte cristo ; she has been dead these ten years . and i am still mourning her loss , exclaimed the major , drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief , and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye .: 98.77
<S> you seem to forget the orders i received to conduct you safe and sound to his highness the prince !: 132.86
<S> nothing , replied bonacieux , nothing .: 39.16
<S> come now , what are you telling me ? fortunately , monsieur d artagnan is in our hands , and you shall be confronted with him . by my faith , i ask no better , cried bonacieux ; i shall not be sorry to see the face of an acquaintance . bring in the monsieur d artagnan , said the commissary to the guards .: 32.21
<S> she would have taken d artagnan not only as her husband , but as her god , he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache .: 75.20
<S> what is the matter , madame ? said mazarin , uneasily .: 8.07
<S> poor danglars looked so crest fallen and <UNK> that monte cristo assumed a <UNK> air towards him .: 468.98
<S> your blessing , your holiness , before you go , i beseech you ! he cried .: 41.29
<S> what is the matter , then ? he asked himself , trembling more than the wind <UNK> cloth he was holding back .: 84.77
<S> athos , perceiving that she knew him , pushed the window with his knee and hand .: 39.07
<S> laporte assured himself , by having it twice repeated , of the <UNK> address , and set off at a run .: 164.64
<S> a knife was plunged up to the hilt in rita s left breast .: 73.74
<S> ah , to see me ? said de winter , cunningly .: 37.00
<S> the pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls ; then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard .: 122.80
<S> mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step .: 153.99
<S> accepted the money ! said d artagnan .: 45.89
<S> i have a sure method of <UNK> tongues .: 209.64
<S> de villefort is here . well ? he comes to fetch his wife and daughter . why so ? because madame de saint me ran is just arrived in paris , bringing the news of m. de saint me ran s death , which took place on the first stage after he left marseilles .: 33.56
<S> i draw upon him for 600,000 francs , my bills are returned <UNK> , and , more than that , i hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400,000 francs , payable at his correspondent s in paris at the end of this month .: 85.72
<S> get down into the longboat . that is , when i have lighted the match ? i will undertake that .: 101.42
<S> but , as we have said , bazin had not , by his fortunate return , removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends .: 61.83
<S> porthos rose , always ready for this kind of adventure .: 88.76
<S> i am going to beauchamp , in whose journal this paragraph appears , and i shall insist on his <UNK> the assertion before two witnesses . beauchamp will never retract . then we must fight . no you will not , for he will tell you , what is very true , that perhaps there were fifty officers in the greek army bearing the same name . we will fight , nevertheless .: 119.22
<S> good journey to him ! with all his millions , he will not have enough to pay for his shroud ! said another .: 85.80
<S> mousqueton , groaning , slipped from his horse , his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle .: 97.68
<S> grimaud , said athos , pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion , take those gentlemen , set them up against the wall , put their hats upon their heads , and their guns in their hands . oh , the great man ! cried d artagnan .: 30.65
<S> take care that the french do not take their revenge on you for the sicilian <UNK> . i will do my best . the streets are full of armed men , continued d artagnan .: 63.03
<S> villefort rose , or rather sprang , from his chair , hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk , emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket , stood motionless an instant , his hand pressed to his head , muttered a few inarticulate sounds , and then , perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders , he sprang into the carriage , ordering the postilions to drive to m. de saint me ran s .: 47.44
<S> were our object money only , he said , we should be rich directly . how s that ? don t you understand , porthos ?: 72.42
<S> he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants , who doubtless had received their instructions .: 45.68
<S> external existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream .: 363.84
<S> can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties .: 28.27
<S> my dear monsieur louvieres , said the coadjutor , believe me , i am truly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to you . is that true , and do you speak seriously ? asked louvieres .: 28.87
<S> three days passed seventy two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes !: 613.02
<S> at the expiration of a year the governor was transferred ; he had obtained charge of the fortress at ham .: 77.73
<S> bazin ! cried the four young men , calling their lackeys , clean my boots , and fetch the horses from the ho tel . each musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general ho tel , as at a <UNK> , his own horse and that of his lackey .: 67.33
<S> blacas , remain . ah , sir , said the minister of police to villefort , as they left the tuileries , you entered by luck s door your fortune is made . will it be long first ? muttered villefort , saluting the minister , whose career was ended , and looking about him for a hackney coach .: 85.59
<S> he had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man , wrapped in a large cloak .: 26.69
<S> you had friends , albert ; break off their acquaintance .: 179.84
<S> good evening , sir , answered the soldier , in a strong provincial accent .: 30.31
<S> does monsieur de bragelonne remain in paris ? she inquired .: 43.67
<S> my name is edmond dante s , replied the young man calmly ; i am mate of the pharaon , belonging to messrs. morrel son . your age ? continued villefort .: 60.92
<S> to see him so self satisfied <UNK> me with myself .: 411.53
<S> edmond , my friend , do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart .: 129.25
<S> left alone , the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter , which he secured with his special seal .: 91.41
<S> one of these ladies , the fair one , uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house , while the other , rushing to the bell rope , rang with all her strength .: 88.76
<S> as soon as he appeared in the count of morcerf s antechamber , a footman , the same who at rome had brought the count s card to the two young men , and announced his visit , sprang into the vestibule , and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him .: 47.95
<S> au revoir , not farewell .: 79.16
<S> say when shall it be ?: 119.50
<S> my profession condemns me to <UNK> .: 306.57
<S> do you not think with me , m. de villefort , that general quesnel , whom they believed attached to the usurper , but who was really entirely devoted to me , has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush ? it is probable , sire , replied villefort .: 46.15
<S> they entered .: 40.15
<S> he threw himself upon it , and fell asleep .: 15.71
<S> i serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal ; but i serve the one with joy and the other against my will .: 80.77
<S> but to return to these <UNK> . true , this story has diverted our attention from them .: 122.39
<S> but athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders .: 158.77
<S> now , will you taste our wine , and without prejudice say what you think of it ? thank you , my friend , thank you ; unfortunately , i have just breakfasted . well , said porthos , arrange the table , mousqueton , and while we breakfast , d artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left us . willingly , said d artagnan .: 43.90
<S> nevertheless , i promise thee thou shalt be hidden here , though i risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy , if it was found out that i gave one rebel an asylum . ah !: 216.47
<S> a bolt grated and danglars was a prisoner .: 219.63
<S> come to our house tomorrow .: 76.30
<S> come , then , and take it , friend , said the gascon .: 12.36
<S> fortunately , she was <UNK> , and it was fright alone that had overcome teresa .: 186.76
<S> where have you read in the scriptures , i ask you , that the english are your neighbors ? where , that is true , said blaisois ; at least , i can t now recall it . a child s reason i repeat it , continued mousqueton .: 51.94
<S> here is my pass countersigned , said the latter .: 53.06
<S> poor fellow ! he exclaimed .: 15.72
<S> stop , in the name of heaven , monsieur porthos ! cried she .: 18.05
<S> what time do you breakfast , albert ? at half past ten . precisely ? asked debray , taking out his watch .: 28.48
<S> bradshaw waited , and as there was no reply there was a moment of silence .: 31.12
<S> are there , then , really women who bear the name of hayde e anywhere but in byron s <UNK> ? certainly there are .: 181.58
<S> 19 in the old greek legend the atreidae , or children of <UNK> , were doomed to punishment because of the abominable crime of their father .: 286.38
<S> if the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem .: 56.20
<S> oh , no self love , beauchamp .: 62.97
<S> she comes from <UNK> , so i call her the beautiful indian . raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady , who smiled .: 114.82
<S> shall i see you again soon ? next week i hope my duties will afford me a little liberty , and i will take advantage of it to come and put things in order here , as they must necessarily be much deranged . very well ; i shall expect you .: 82.47
<S> thus , you see , though born in paris , i was brought up in corsica . there was a moment s silence , during which one could have fancied the hall empty , so profound was the stillness .: 59.96
<S> behind this wall ?: 93.13
<S> although i had eaten nothing since the evening before , my fears prevented my feeling hunger .: 150.38
<S> morrel said not a word .: 48.63
<S> i was retreating on foot , for my horse was dead .: 55.77
<S> the duke looked at this strange figure with surprise .: 27.62
<S> the young girl no longer breathed , no breath issued through the half closed teeth ; the white lips no longer quivered the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor , and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax .: 269.87
<S> but take no notice ; we know all about that . well , said porthos , it appears to me that the means are very simple . what ? asked d artagnan .: 18.45
<S> my hand ? said she .: 25.20
<S> to this monsieur de beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him , he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts ; since he could not be a bayard , he would become a raphael or a michael angelo .: 124.70
<S> not to reflect on what had passed , as one might fancy .: 137.88
<S> what the count said was true the most curious spectacle in life is that of death .: 116.48
<S> speak , comte de la fere ! my lord , replied athos , for myself i have nothing to demand .: 29.29
<S> do not go away ! exclaimed d artagnan , impelled by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature , the native brightness of his character ; i swear that i would give the last drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the friendship of such a friend as you , athos of such a man as you , aramis . and he threw himself into the arms of athos .: 60.97
<S> you see , said the king , that it is useless for you to resist .: 19.22
<S> i was dancing the galop at torlonia s with the countess g . then he drew his watch from his pocket , that he might see how time sped .: 133.75
<S> is our little neighbor worse ? asked d artagnan , seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth .: 57.75
<S> s blood ! cried he to d artagnan , do not kill him , young man , i beg of you .: 18.80
<S> monte cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilian s room ; when he reached the landing he listened attentively , but all was still .: 64.85
<S> lemonade was a very bad thing for him . grandpapa s bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side ; poor barrois was very thirsty , and was thankful to drink anything he could find . madame de villefort started .: 140.60
<S> the ballet was called <UNK> .: 137.28
<S> devil take these puritans , said mazarin aside ; they are carved from granite . then he added aloud , but you have relations left you ? i have one remaining .: 110.17
<S> the cardinal , as it appears , pursues her and persecutes her more than ever .: 89.96
<S> instead of performing your part of this contract , as i performed mine , you bought me from the scotch , cheaply , i know , and that does honor to the <UNK> talent of your government .: 110.88
<S> mademoiselle s lady s maid says , sir , that mademoiselle is finishing her <UNK> , and will be here shortly . danglars nodded , to signify that he was satisfied .: 152.81
<S> parliament can never have passed such an act as that . at this moment the landlord came in .: 84.61
<S> the catalans chapter 4 .: 53.89
<S> those studs were enclosed in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm ?: 221.49
<S> d artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that , and each day milady gave him a more gracious reception .: 54.59
<S> he would then be lost , and france , perhaps , with him .: 40.77
<S> where are you going ? cried the two musketeers in a breath .: 20.31
<S> what sort of a man is he ? ask the vicomte de morcerf . you hear , m. de morcerf , i am referred to you , said the countess .: 27.63
<S> he perceived his mistake ; but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his <UNK> , and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness .: 90.80
<S> had i ten <UNK> in my family , i should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times . as for monte cristo , his head was bent down , his arms were powerless .: 99.49
<S> at this moment a patrol passed by .: 25.58
<S> we will embark for algiers , for england , for america , or , if you prefer it , retire to the country and only return to paris when our friends have reconciled your family . valentine shook her head .: 104.45
<S> d artagnan , on his return , sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the guards , with strict orders that great care should be taken of it ; and then , on the day appointed , as the dinner was fixed for midday d artagnan sent planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment .: 88.48
<S> who knows if tomorrow , or the next day after , the third attack may not come on ?: 74.57
<S> approach then , said the messenger , or i will come nearer to you , if you prefer it . i will agree to neither one nor the other , replied the young soldier ; place the object which i desire to see in the ray of light which shines there , and retire while i examine it . be it so , said the envoy ; and he retired , after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by selim .: 83.44
<S> at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage , which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop .: 18.91
<S> who informed you this was the master i propose to you ?: 53.09
<S> i can not stay here any longer . with all my heart ! replied danglars , pleased to find the other so tractable .: 57.90
<S> well , then , under these circumstances , said caderousse , i will , i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond thought so sincere and <UNK> . begin with his father , if you please . said the abbe ; edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love . the history is a sad one , sir , said caderousse , shaking his head ; perhaps you know all the earlier part of it ? yes . answered the abbe ; edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles . at la re serve !: 71.45
<S> what were you saying ? he asked with his flattering manner ; that monsieur de beaufort had escaped , were you not ? oh , no , my lord ! said the incredulous soldier .: 28.85
<S> he likes good wine ; now you have the key of the cellar .: 58.53
<S> the cha teau d if chapter 9 .: 19.32
<S> he had not heard a carriage stop in the street , or steps in the antechamber ; the door had itself opened noiselessly .: 75.30
<S> he proceeded , nevertheless , and came opposite to an iron gate , ornamented in the taste of the period .: 69.62
<S> at the palais royal , the crowd , which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater ; like an impetuous mob , a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled <UNK> into the rue saint honore .: 106.23
<S> is he still as stingy as ever ?: 82.21
<S> this gascon is a precious fellow ; even his misadventures are of use . the cardinal referred to that man whom d artagnan upset at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean in paris , and who was no other than the councillor broussel .: 87.34
<S> then she ventured to ask what had become of felton .: 39.63
<S> when in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage , he did so immediately , and was surprised to see so many well known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant .: 84.47
<S> really , i think the thing very difficult . not at all , cried d artagnan , who was anxious the matter should be accomplished ; on the contrary , i think it very easy .: 32.12
<S> ah , madame de chevreuse was less cruel than you .: 44.19
<S> how long i had been in this unconscious state i know not , when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol , followed by a fearful cry .: 64.18
<S> and he turned up two cards as usual , a king for d artagnan and an ace for himself .: 106.38
<S> well , for my part , i , a <UNK> ruffian , who can go and stand close to a scaffold , in order to have a better view of the king s execution i remain . athos turned pale .: 65.31
<S> during the war with spain he was employed in the commissariat of the french army , and made a fortune ; then with that money he <UNK> in the funds , and <UNK> or <UNK> his capital ; and , having first married his banker s daughter , who left him a widower , he has married a second time , a widow , a madame de nargonne , daughter of m. de servieux , the king s chamberlain , who is in high favor at court .: 100.01
<S> on !: 53.45
<S> creatures of the people , armed with halberds , guarding your doors .: 308.30
<S> broussel was seated at the table with his family , having his wife opposite to him , his two daughters by his side , and his son , louvieres , whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the councillor an accident from which he had quite recovered at the bottom of the table .: 71.07
<S> then , commencing a loud whistling noise , he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes ; then , undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage , ali quietly harnessed the <UNK> animals to the count s chariot , took the reins in his hands , and mounted the box , when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses , he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start ; and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays , now changed into a couple of dull , sluggish , stupid <UNK> , was a slow , <UNK> pace , kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg saint honore .: 202.53
<S> there , madame , he said , is monsieur gondy , who hastens to obey your majesty s summons . the queen advanced a few steps to meet him , and then stopped , cold , severe , unmoved , with her lower lip <UNK> protruded .: 83.95
<S> oh , no , no ! cried milady ; no , sir , do not call him , i conjure you .: 15.84
<S> there was a third point in view , which will appear hereafter .: 104.53
<S> has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth ? if they knew anything , they would not question people in this manner , said d artagnan to himself .: 76.36
<S> my intention was , if caderousse was alone , to acquaint him with my presence , finish the meal the custom house officers had interrupted , and profit by the threatened storm to return to the rho ne , and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew .: 179.96
<S> however , i scold you instead of him , and in his place ; the storm will blow over more easily , believe me .: 92.86
<S> what , above all , manifested the shrewdness of the steward , and the profound science of the master , the one in carrying out the ideas of the other , was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy , impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time , had in a single day acquired the aspect of life , was scented with its master s favorite perfumes , and had the very light regulated according to his wish .: 129.08
<S> she scarcely resisted .: 238.11
<S> he beat a retreat toward the market , but there he met planchet with his halberdiers ; their halberds were leveled at him threateningly .: 287.68
<S> the matter was no longer doubtful .: 43.15
<S> what is it ? yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m. de morcerf , begging me to attend the opera . and i , said debray .: 45.99
<S> valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass , but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her , and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath , and felt the pressure of his hand .: 75.53
<S> hayde e had remained until the close of the meeting .: 59.69
<S> ah , ah , murmured he , is dante s then a member of some <UNK> society , that his protector thus employs the <UNK> form ?: 286.17
<S> it is , nevertheless , <UNK> to my mind .: 51.64
<S> that will teach me , he said , to have my guards provided with better horses ; for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend , you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive . well , there s nothing bad in that , it seems to me , said porthos .: 41.79
<S> wrote , in a hand as small as possible , another note on the margin of his horace , and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own , while he is only commenting upon the idea of another , said : go on , my dear duke , go on i listen . sire , said blacas , who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing villefort to his own profit , i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me ; but a serious minded man , deserving all my confidence , and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words , has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king , and so i hastened to you , sire . <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , continued louis xviii. , still annotating .: 127.10
<S> there is a third , and the most terrible that is my condition as a mortal being .: 65.22
<S> at ten o clock the vessel cast anchor in the harbor of dover , and at half past ten d artagnan placed his foot on english land , crying , here i am at last ! but that was not all ; they must get to london .: 49.02
<S> what ; is it news to you ?: 61.17
<S> oh , yes , was the ready answer .: 61.64
<S> <UNK> was , however , i must confess , more skilful . what would you have , sir ? said the lady , laughing ; we do what we can .: 47.65
<S> i have no enmity against m. franz , and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him . on whom , then ! on me ? on you ?: 79.64
<S> perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck , and to offer him employment from his new master .: 103.62
<S> well , said he , let her come , with your consent and that of the baron , and we will try and give her an engagement , though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers . go , corne lie , said madame danglars , i do not require you any longer . corne lie obeyed , and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a charming loose dress , and came and sat down close to debray .: 78.14
<S> no , no , monsieur , said monte cristo .: 6.05
<S> d artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use .: 72.79
<S> the two friends approached winter , who , with his head on his hands , was gazing at the heavens ; he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder .: 35.72
<S> between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover .: 96.26
<S> well , let us pledge the ring , but upon one condition . what ? that there shall be five hundred crowns for you , and five hundred crowns for me . don t dream it , athos .: 53.19
<S> you will soon know . but still we are forbidden to give you any explanation . dante s , trained in discipline , knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates , who were forbidden to reply ; and so he remained silent .: 92.64
<S> whatever may ensue , i will go . if you are determined , said athos , do so . but the bastille ? said aramis .: 51.06
<S> during this time the executioner had raised his mace , and signed to them to get out of the way ; the criminal strove to rise , but , ere he had time , the mace fell on his left temple .: 57.03
<S> come in , said franz .: 13.12
<S> the captain descended last , or rather , he did not descend , he would not quit the vessel ; so i took him round the waist , and threw him into the boat , and then i jumped after him .: 43.19
<S> nothing would be more easy , said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail , but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal . i have that permission , said the gentleman , drawing the paper from his pocket ; here it is . have it examined by the governor of the port , said the shipmaster , and give me the preference . where shall i find the governor ? at his country house . and that is situated ? at a quarter of a league from the city .: 52.89
<S> speak , i beg you ! i will never confess that but to the man who should read to the bottom of my soul ! d artagnan looked at kitty for the second time .: 31.63
<S> in truth , in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers .: 78.85
<S> there all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force .: 288.29
<S> yes , replied the narrator ; that was the name which the traveller gave to vampa as his own . well , and what may you have to say against this name ? inquired albert ; it is a very pretty name , and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth , i must confess . franz said no more .: 51.54
<S> but never mind ; that sort of intoxication is not dangerous , and will have no bad effects . and lord de winter retired swearing , which at that period was a very <UNK> habit .: 107.82
<S> doubtless , too , the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant <UNK> which was granted them .: 171.60
<S> but excuse me , sir , for talking of our domestic misfortunes ; i interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist . no , madame , i did not say as much as that , replied the count with a smile ; quite the contrary .: 36.12
<S> the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle , as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free , unsealed the letter of madame de longueville and started at a gallop on the road to lens , attended by raoul and his small escort , whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions .: 112.31
<S> and why , i should like to know , persisted caderousse , should they put dante s in prison ?: 63.73
<S> if we lay hands on this fortune , we may enjoy it without remorse . and you say this treasure amounts to two millions of roman crowns ; nearly thirteen millions of our money . 2 impossible ! said dante s , staggered at the enormous amount .: 125.86
<S> i am hayde e , the daughter of ali tepelini , pasha of yanina , and of vasiliki , his beloved wife . <UNK> the blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman , the brilliancy of her eye , and her highly important communication , produced an indescribable effect on the assembly .: 91.69
<S> besides , we are safe for to day ; you know the axiom , non bis in idem . courage , sir , said raoul to the wounded man .: 55.53
<S> nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey s visits .: 174.03
<S> young edward ! a burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the least <UNK> the speaker , who continued , yes , gentlemen ; edward , the infant <UNK> , who is quite an <UNK> in the art of killing . you are jesting . not at all .: 155.59
<S> her mouth was mute ; but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence , supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked .: 202.81
<S> if he were rich , if he had cavalcanti s fortune , that might be pardoned .: 51.36
<S> he jumped from his horse , threw the bridle on his servant s arms , and joined them .: 23.49
<S> and the other one ? demanded the count .: 24.46
<S> concerning a court intrigue chapter <UNK> .: 257.26
<S> they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks , by which a man could scarcely pass .: 46.55
<S> it was then , especially while conversing with madame danglars , and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation , that the count noticed m. andrea cavalcanti s solicitude , his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass , and of manifesting his admiration .: 115.31
<S> at the door they found the carriage .: 13.15
<S> but at the sight of the young man , who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche , and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her , mme .: 49.94
<S> although i am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to me . bah ! said athos , god is great , as say the followers of <UNK> , and the future is in his hands . then , swallowing the contents of his glass , which he put down close to him , athos arose carelessly , took the musket next to him , and drew near to one of the loopholes .: 54.70
<S> nevertheless , he understood it all , but was deaf .: 70.79
<S> sire , continued m. de blacas , if it only be to reassure a faithful servant , will your majesty send into languedoc , provence , and dauphine , trusty men , who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling in these three provinces ? <UNK> <UNK> , replied the king , continuing the <UNK> in his horace .: 150.93
<S> on our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night , and to convey it into the town , by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected .: 51.08
<S> why , diamonds and she is covered with them . to me she seems <UNK> , observed euge nie ; she would look far better if she wore <UNK> , and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists . see how the artist <UNK> out ! exclaimed madame danglars .: 210.91
<S> it was the marquis de saint me ran .: 10.63
<S> i forgot to ask you where are you taking me ? to the cardinal . what does he want with me ? i do not know .: 17.06
<S> ratonneau and <UNK> gue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the cha teau d if , but ratonneau and <UNK> gue are inhabited , as is also the islet of <UNK> .: 457.69
<S> i have a fancy , and mean to get a <UNK> . well , you shall have your five hundred francs , said andrea ; but it is very hard for me , my poor caderousse you take advantage bah , said caderousse , when you have access to countless stores . one would have said andrea anticipated his companion s words , so did his eye flash like lightning , but it was but for a moment .: 75.38
<S> the magistrate , harassed and fatigued , had descended to the garden of his house , and in a gloomy mood , similar to that in which <UNK> <UNK> off the <UNK> <UNK> , he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose trees , which , placed along the avenue , seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season .: 175.49
<S> an hour had passed since the sun had set , when franz fancied he saw , at a quarter of a mile to the left , a dark mass , but he could not precisely make out what it was , and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land , he remained silent ; suddenly a great light appeared on the <UNK> ; land might resemble a cloud , but the fire was not a meteor .: 92.26
<S> ah ! bonacieux <UNK> from this ah that the affair grew more and more intricate .: 382.34
<S> pardon me , said he , my dear baron , but one of my friends , the abbe busoni , whom you perhaps saw pass by , has just arrived in paris ; not having seen him for a long time , i could not make up my mind to leave him sooner , so i hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait . nay , said danglars , it is my fault ; i have chosen my visit at a wrong time , and will retire . not at all ; on the contrary , be seated ; but what is the matter with you ?: 34.41
<S> i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul . you are not called lionne for nothing , observed madame de chevreuse , your teeth are terrible . you are unjust to a great poet , it seems to me , raoul ventured to say .: 68.50
<S> the valet threw into the carriage his military cloak , in which two swords were wrapped , and , shutting the door , he took his seat by the side of the coachman .: 43.52
<S> monsieur d artagnan is in monsieur dessessart s guards , and this gentleman is in the company of monsieur de tre ville s musketeers .: 20.44
<S> for us , also ? inquired athos .: 39.81
<S> the young girl is lovely and her tears only <UNK> her ; the lady appears to be about forty years of age , the girl about fourteen .: 127.59
<S> it may easily be understood , therefore , that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his eminence s guardsmen had received .: 90.60
<S> branded in the eyes of the world you invoke , try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor mad ! then , addressing the man who accompanied him , executioner , said he , do your duty . oh , his name , his name ! cried felton .: 74.45
<S> milady listened .: 32.55
<S> i learned it since i have been in prison , and that from the conversation of monsieur the commissary an amiable man . the cardinal repressed another smile .: 59.45
<S> at first my neck was cramped with looking at it , but at the end of a year i became used to it ; and then we have our hours of recreation , and our <UNK> . <UNK> ? yes . when ? when we have a fog . ah , to be sure . those are indeed <UNK> to me ; i go into the garden , i plant , i <UNK> , i trim , i kill the insects all day long . how long have you been here ? ten years , and five as a supernumerary make fifteen . you are fifty five years old . how long must you have served to claim the pension ? oh , sir , twenty five years . and how much is the pension ? a hundred crowns . poor humanity ! murmured monte cristo .: 101.53
<S> the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman , for i rushed at once to the stable .: 58.22
<S> i have but ten days , and this evening two of them will be gone . in the morning , when they entered milady s chamber they had brought her breakfast .: 30.82
<S> the doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table , and having fulfilled his duty , was conducted out by d avrigny .: 73.96
<S> at what hour ? inquired a turnkey .: 24.47
<S> but why did she return to tours without telling me anything ? because she was in fear of being arrested . why has she not written to me , then ? because she was afraid of compromising you . d artagnan , you restore me to life ! cried aramis .: 40.33
<S> he only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock , which hangs behind his uniform , said another musketeer .: 149.72
<S> the carriage drove round , and stopped at the steps , followed by the horsemen .: 24.14
<S> peter , on the contrary , of whom the <UNK> are the <UNK> , continued the jesuit ; <UNK> <UNK> present the fingers .: 331.75
<S> what would the patron think ?: 67.13
<S> the explanation would be too long , my dear landlord , replied franz .: 43.35
<S> oh , merce de s , i have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy , with the groan of sorrow , with the last effort of despair ; i have uttered it when frozen with cold , crouched on the straw in my dungeon ; i have uttered it , consumed with heat , rolling on the stone floor of my prison .: 91.98
<S> without <UNK> danger he never shrank from an encounter ; in short , he had been a soldier and arms <UNK> a man ; it was , therefore , on the footing of friends that d artagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois .: 107.67
<S> he resolved to adopt the second , and began that day to carry out his resolve .: 92.56
<S> calm yourself , dear rene , said the soft voice , the same thing will never happen again .: 74.58
<S> your pardon , sir , replied villefort , quite astounded , but you will excuse me if , when i presented myself to you , i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men .: 77.21
<S> every night the count had given him news , which was the next morning confirmed by noirtier .: 57.02
<S> it is not , either , that my heart is less touched by him than any other ; that would be a <UNK> s reason , which i consider quite beneath me .: 74.02
<S> monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively .: 42.91
<S> it seems to me i did my duty .: 21.51
<S> they came with their usual promptness , and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night .: 67.54
<S> you are welcome , count ! she exclaimed , as he entered .: 19.85
<S> on , on ! he cried , this is no moment for compliments ; or rather , back , for the battle seems to be lost by the frondeurs . it is a matter of indifference to me , said aramis ; i came here only to meet de chatillon ; i have met him , i am contented ; tis something to have met de chatillon in a duel ! and besides , we have a prisoner , said athos , pointing to raoul .: 51.16
<S> it seems his former master accustomed him to that . well , dear monsieur la ramee , replied the cardinal let him prove a true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural <UNK> and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable , and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the king s health . mazarin was large in promises , quite unlike the virtuous monsieur grimaud so <UNK> by la ramee ; for he said nothing and did much .: 197.51
<S> the second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by the simple and firm declaration of the musketeer , upon whom he was anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to gain over men of the sword ; but the name of m. de tre ville , and that of m. de la tre mouille , commanded a little reflection .: 60.97
<S> why , really , one would say that you four were <UNK> !: 115.34
<S> if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement , you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.e.8 .: 17.36
<S> upon my word , said albert , you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess . you are mistaken in thinking so , returned franz calmly ; but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most <UNK> blunders , i mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions ; believe me , nothing is more <UNK> than to form any <UNK> of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon ; there is a <UNK> of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess nothing more . is there , indeed , my good fellow ?: 163.78
<S> we are safe on that side , said buckingham , turning toward d artagnan .: 22.87
<S> several days elapsed , and they neither saw nor heard of cucumetto .: 74.61
<S> rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs .: 91.47
<S> ah , since the dangers i incur on my own account can not stop you , think of those you may yourself run ! me ? yes ; there is peril of imprisonment , risk of life in knowing me . then i will not leave you . monsieur ! said the young woman , supplicating him and clasping her hands together , monsieur , in the name of heaven , by the honor of a soldier , by the courtesy of a gentleman , depart !: 81.05
<S> live the guards ! m. de busigny was the first to come and shake athos by the hand , and acknowledge that the wager was lost .: 73.33
<S> embrace , with all your heart , the vicomte , for your devoted , friend , athos . i believe , by heaven , said d artagnan , that i shall embrace him , since he s upon our road ; and if he is so unfortunate as to lose our dear athos , from that very day he becomes my son . and i , said porthos , shall make him my sole heir . let us see , what more does athos say ? should you meet on your journey a certain monsieur mordaunt , distrust him , in a letter i can not say more . monsieur mordaunt ! exclaimed the gascon , surprised .: 64.44
<S> bernouin , said the cardinal , not turning round , for having whistled , he knew that it was his valet de chambre who was behind him ; what musketeers are now within the palace ? the black musketeers , my lord . what company ? tre ville s company . is there any officer belonging to this company in the ante chamber ? lieutenant d artagnan . a man on whom we can depend , i hope . yes , my lord . give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it on . the valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded .: 66.55
<S> he ?: 60.82
<S> d artagnan , sick of the <UNK> of paris , thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another , he ought to be very happy in such a paradise ; then he shook his head , saying , if i were porthos and d artagnan came to make me such a proposition as i am going to make to him , i know what i should say to it . as to planchet , he thought of little or nothing , but was happy as a hunting <UNK> in his old master s company .: 60.49
<S> the general remembered that i had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition .: 86.01
<S> they entered the common hall , and placed themselves at table .: 43.06
<S> he bowed with great friendship to the count .: 37.68
<S> athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing room , where there were several people .: 28.41
<S> well ? asked the cardinal , on seeing la houdinie re return .: 63.93
<S> a light appeared under the door ; this light announced the reappearance of her jailers .: 89.77
<S> he bowed to him , then , full of gratitude for the past and for the future ; and the worthy captain , who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man , so brave and so resolute , pressed his hand kindly , wishing him a pleasant journey .: 76.36
<S> he consequently sprang up again , re entered the office , with a turn of his finger set the clock right again , that it might not be perceived the next day that it had been put wrong , and certain from that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi , he ran downstairs and soon found himself in the street .: 78.62
<S> this idea occurred to me , and did not leave me ; it is of this <UNK> thought that i now bear the punishment . continue , continue ! said felton ; i am eager to see you attain your vengeance ! oh , i resolved that it should take place as soon as possible .: 59.83
<S> in the first place , do you accept ? asked the cardinal .: 12.04
<S> unfortunates , who ought to begin with god , do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance .: 150.44
<S> we were coming from <UNK> laden with grain .: 507.32
<S> egad !: 25.42
<S> you say we are going to see athos now , and if you will come thither , i beg you to make haste , for we have lost much time already .: 31.54
<S> i had been tracked by a customs officer , who had lost sight of me near the tavern ; feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there , he had returned to summon his comrades , who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol , and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile .: 113.54
<S> all right , all right , said the jailer ; all right , since you will have it so .: 59.34
<S> i believe that this singular man , who appears to fathom the motives of everyone , has purposely arranged for me to meet m. and madame de villefort , and sometimes , i confess , i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love . my good friend , said valentine , i should take you for a visionary , and should tremble for your reason , if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this .: 55.15
<S> he had within his reach his pistols and carbine , and ali , standing near him , held one of the small arabian <UNK> , whose form has not varied since the crusades .: 211.19
<S> the president s sword , which was simply , as he had said , one he carried in his cane , was five inches shorter than the general s , and had no guard .: 61.25
<S> in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four , and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked <UNK> of the brow and by a deeper sadness .: 316.05
<S> valentine looked at the young man ; they heard the street door close , then m. de villefort locked the garden door , and returned upstairs .: 40.74
<S> in the name of heaven , said maximilian , if you know anything of him , tell us what it is . alas , cried monte cristo , striving to repress his emotion , if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor , i fear you will never see him again .: 31.85
<S> a burning fire , a red hot iron , the iron of the executioner , was imprinted on my shoulder . felton uttered a groan .: 91.23
<S> when you had betrayed your friend , god began not to strike , but to warn you .: 78.57
<S> porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right , whilst d artagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left .: 21.58
<S> oh , valentine , you who have so much influence over your grandpapa , try to make him answer soon . and do you , said valentine , depend on me to <UNK> the <UNK> and arouse the memory of grandpapa ? yes , cried morrel , make haste .: 83.72
<S> you do not give us a day no , not even an hour before your departure ? my carriage is at the door , madame , and i must be in rome in five days . but does maximilian go to rome ? exclaimed emmanuel .: 50.60
<S> it is well , said he , kissing it ; it is my master s ring ! and throwing the match on the ground , he trampled on it and extinguished it .: 44.11
<S> i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these bank notes ; it seemed to me that i was in a dream , and , as it always happens in a dream , i felt myself riveted to the spot .: 50.56
<S> the abbe sank upon edmond s bed , while edmond himself remained standing .: 83.12
<S> you will have pity on me . ah , if you speak in that way , said athos , you will break my heart , and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask .: 37.47
<S> how perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room !: 284.47
<S> and so , my friends , we return to paris ?: 40.65
<S> d artagnan , tell us what sort of a night you have had , and we will describe ours afterward . ah , yes , said a light horseman , with a glass of brandy in his hand , which he sipped slowly .: 50.35
<S> i am commissioned to seize your person , sir , said comminges , in the same tone and with the same politeness ; and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me . a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people , so peacefully assembled there , would not have produced a more appalling effect .: 91.83
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> help to put me on the bed ; i think i shall feel better there . have you any one to depend on for assistance ? my wife is at durham and may return at any moment .: 79.98
<S> at each moment , in the midst of the crowd , the buzzing , and the laughter , the door keeper s voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department , respected in the army , or illustrious in the literary world , and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups .: 108.07
<S> with a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its <UNK> details .: 128.93
<S> what , again ? she exclaimed , in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob ; really , you pain me . a long silence followed ; the peach , like the grapes , fell to the ground .: 111.09
<S> this corridor was guarded , not by a sentinel , but by a confidential servant , through whom , in case of urgency , charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject .: 148.72
<S> how can you tell me that ? does that alarm you ? cried d artagnan .: 20.64
<S> cries were heard from the interior , of which they could not comprehend the sense .: 51.29
<S> are they made to order ? precisely , said the count ; six years since i bought a horse in <UNK> remarkable for its <UNK> .: 213.36
<S> now he is gone , it is your turn to get out , said mme .: 20.88
<S> how were you to blame in that affair ? listen when one bears an irreproachable name , as i do , one is rather sensitive . everybody <UNK> you , sir ; and , above all , mademoiselle danglars ! poor euge nie ! said danglars ; do you know she is going to embrace a religious life ? no . alas , it is unhappily but too true .: 86.95
<S> m. danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end . am i , indeed , so happy ? said albert , who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow .: 100.53
<S> the thin , spare man ? yes . the executioner , in short ? asked aramis .: 84.44
<S> we separated at midnight .: 61.86
<S> i requested him to call , and when i came to the louvre i left orders if he came , to desire him to wait . let him be sent for instantly . your majesty s orders shall be executed ; but but what ? but the queen will perhaps refuse to obey . my orders ? yes , if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king . well , that she may have no doubt on that head , i will go and inform her myself . your majesty will not forget that i have done everything in my power to prevent a rupture . yes , duke , yes , i know you are very indulgent toward the queen , too indulgent , perhaps ; we shall have occasion , i warn you , at some future period to speak of that . whenever it shall please your majesty ; but i shall be always happy and proud , sire , to sacrifice myself to the harmony which i desire to see reign between you and the queen of france . very well , cardinal , very well ; but , meantime , send for monsieur the keeper of the seals .: 62.80
<S> so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection ; so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation , she reclined in her corner of the carriage , and one after the other passed in review all the <UNK> which presented themselves to her mind .: 152.58
<S> yet , through a singular impulse , it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied , but to emmanuel .: 93.96
<S> alas ! he said , i am then to die ?: 23.58
<S> this was , indeed , a horrid event , said he in a hoarse voice .: 20.01
<S> i fear i shall be forced to suspend payment . have you no friends who could assist you ? morrel smiled mournfully .: 89.06
<S> i understand , he said , you confess ; but a confession made to the judges , a confession made at the last moment , extorted when the crime can not be denied , <UNK> not the punishment inflicted on the guilty ! the punishment ? exclaimed madame de villefort , the punishment , monsieur ?: 140.60
<S> sir ! said raoul , allow me , after thanking you for that poor fellow s life , to thank you on my own account .: 53.67
<S> bazin became a lay brother .: 281.38
<S> they advanced about thirty paces , and then stopped at a small <UNK> surrounded with rocks , in which seats had been cut , not unlike sentry boxes .: 209.87
<S> on reaching the capital athos and aramis found it in arms .: 64.07
<S> the baron , finding himself disarmed , took two or three steps back , but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell backward .: 82.74
<S> ah , gentlemen , he cried , as the two friends entered , you are very happy !: 20.52
<S> in the clover fields beyond the chestnut trees , a <UNK> was mounting up to heaven , while pouring out her clear morning song .: 429.23
<S> the blade was round , and of flexible silver .: 142.47
<S> marquise , said villefort , approaching his future mother in law , i request your pardon for thus leaving you .: 81.01
<S> with the first rays of day their tongues were loosened ; with the sun gaiety revived .: 245.43
<S> after which your majesty will , i think , no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf . the queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair .: 61.40
<S> i held the horses , my hands were full , your honor . a shot was fired that moment ; mousqueton shrieked with pain .: 159.06
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> monte cristo drew him in gently .: 38.55
<S> then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin , and became the comtesse de la fe re all eyes were turned towards athos , whose real name that was , and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said .: 73.53
<S> the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself , with the deepest respect , at the feet of monsieur de chavigny , who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud , but a frown succeeded , and he bit his lips with vexation .: 135.94
<S> you hear me at a quarter past midnight in fact , in twenty minutes . i understand all perfectly , sir , replied groslow ; but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake ; would it not be better to intrust one of the men to set fire to the train ? my dear groslow , answered mordaunt , you know the french proverb , nothing one does not do one s self is ever well done . i shall abide by that rule . grimaud had heard all this , if he had not understood it .: 80.95
<S> i can not allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render .: 124.12
<S> are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday ?: 140.84
<S> but his confidence in grimaud , whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind , increased , and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his <UNK> .: 304.59
<S> he left the room , and returned in five minutes with a phial .: 21.58
<S> he addressed about twelve words to him ; grimaud answered in four .: 176.40
<S> your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening , my good man , and i advise you to tell the whole truth ; for your repentance alone can remove the anger of the cardinal . why , i am ready to tell everything , cried bonacieux , at least , all that i know .: 57.35
<S> our family , although still rich for my father s income amounts to half a million , has experienced many misfortunes , and i myself was , at the age of five years , taken away by the treachery of my tutor , so that for fifteen years i have not seen the author of my existence .: 78.45
<S> when one thinks that for twenty years , during which time i did not know what to do with myself , it never occurred to me to come to study rueil . what difference does that make ? said porthos .: 56.96
<S> dante s could not understand a man risking his life for such matters .: 51.63
<S> london .: 196.69
<S> duc de beaufort amused his leisure hours in the donjon of vincennes .: 55.54
<S> and yet you say he has sent you some as from us ? here is his letter , said d artagnan , and he presented the note to his comrades .: 28.79
<S> you are punctual , said he , as he drew back the door .: 14.74
<S> my brother , continued she , was not that my lord buckingham whom i saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived ? himself .: 94.78
<S> you touch them , come in contact with them , speak to them , and they reply to you . ah , said villefort , smiling , i confess i should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me . you have been served as you desire , monsieur , for you were warned just now , and i now again warn you . then you yourself are one of these marked beings ? yes , monsieur , i believe so ; for until now , no man has found himself in a position similar to mine .: 52.22
<S> this was a great matter in the way of honor , but very little in the way of wealth ; so that when the illustrious companion of the great henry died , the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his sword and his motto .: 56.14
<S> he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay , and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint honore .: 48.41
<S> by the torchlight dante s saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes .: 309.96
<S> friends are shadows !: 240.50
<S> now , i have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics , and that in all humility , that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king have caused me to neglect study a little .: 158.04
<S> the suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of d artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket ; but what probability was there that mme .: 62.47
<S> dearest , dearest valentine , exclaimed he , forgive me if i have offended you , and forget the words i spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain . no , maximilian , i am not offended , answered she , but do you not see what a poor , helpless being i am , almost a stranger and an outcast in my father s house , where even he is seldom seen ; whose will has been thwarted , and spirits broken , from the age of ten years , beneath the iron <UNK> so sternly held over me ; oppressed , mortified , and persecuted , day by day , hour by hour , minute by minute , no person has cared for , even observed my sufferings , nor have i ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself .: 167.86
<S> his mouth was large , and the lips , which had not yet regained their color , were particularly thin ; in fact , the deep and crafty look , giving a <UNK> expression to the child s face , belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young .: 132.14
<S> it was a tolerably fine winter s day , and a ray of that pale english sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison .: 208.32
<S> that sigh was the soul , so chaste and so loving , which reascended to heaven .: 238.40
<S> there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had great difficulty in <UNK> his anger , but at a word from flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying : you promise , sir that s agreed that i shall find you to morrow at charenton ? oh , don t be afraid , sir , replied aramis ; and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the louvre .: 81.18
<S> the young louis was already dressed , with the exception of his shoes and doublet ; he had allowed himself to be dressed , in great astonishment , overwhelming laporte with questions , who replied only in these words , sire , it is by the queen s commands . the bedclothes were thrown back , exposing the king s bed linen , which was so worn that here and there holes could be seen .: 116.99
<S> why , that is a fortune ! porthos made a most significant grimace ; mme .: 71.20
<S> once taken , they will be pressed ; when pressed , they will confess everything .: 200.90
<S> but you first came to breakfast , did you not ?: 38.43
<S> there is something so awe inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe .: 240.71
<S> milady possessed that great art , so much studied by women , of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the lids .: 213.45
<S> i don t know much about it , said athos .: 7.75
<S> you incline me to think so , said the king .: 37.63
<S> monsieur , i love men of your <UNK> ; and i foresee plainly that if we don t kill each other , i shall hereafter have much pleasure in your conversation .: 95.56
<S> as for our two prisoners , you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation . they are hot royalists , said groslow .: 88.00
<S> on the summit of a rising ground , a little in advance of the enemy , appeared a short and heavy looking man ; this man was surrounded by officers .: 73.04
<S> no no , i am aware you know me ; but i know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery .: 115.74
<S> the guardsmen , imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack , either of the besieged or the english , sprang to their swords .: 96.08
<S> villefort stepped forward two or three paces , and beheld his child lying no doubt asleep on the sofa .: 120.06
<S> while he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need , he caught a glance from athos .: 108.71
<S> d artagnan had passed himself upon her as de wardes , for whom she had conceived one of those <UNK> fancies common to women of her character .: 120.55
<S> imagine the large and splendid corso , bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces , with their balconies hung with carpets , and their windows with flags .: 205.69
<S> this brother was my only friend ; we became orphans i at five , he at eighteen .: 299.04
<S> i concluded that he was going to versailles , and i was not deceived .: 19.84
<S> still young for he was scarcely forty six years of age he possessed great elegance of form and was above the middle height ; his complexion was brilliant and beautiful ; his glance full of expression ; his nose , though large , was well proportioned ; his forehead broad and majestic ; his hair , of a chestnut color , was curled slightly ; his beard , which was darker than his hair , was turned carefully with a curling iron , a practice that greatly improved it .: 138.91
<S> a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet , and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was , as <UNK> would say , keeping his hand in .: 100.47
<S> in a moment all the bandits were on their feet , and twenty carbines were levelled at the count .: 63.69
<S> by degrees , milady became more <UNK> .: 106.28
<S> on !: 53.45
<S> do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come ? i have been advised of it . but the three millions ? the three millions are probably on the road . then i shall really have them ? oh , well , said the count , i do not think you have yet known the want of money . andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment .: 53.00
<S> blaisois seeing bazin in <UNK> guise , was a little discomposed at his <UNK> and wanted to pass at all risks , believing too , that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth , namely , patience and christian charity .: 230.27
<S> as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly , as much as to say , this is a man who does not appear to me fit for much . after a pause , which appeared an age to rochefort , mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter , and showing it to the count , he said : i find here a letter in which you <UNK> for liberty , monsieur de rochefort .: 59.98
<S> and that you alone , amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers for you have said so , observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat you alone are perfect . no , not perfect , was the count s reply ; only impenetrable , that s all .: 118.17
<S> because he plainly perceives that his <UNK> stands in need of being enlivened by a mixture of good wine . a watered liquor , made from the second pressing of the grape .: 311.16
<S> no mysteries , no cloak to hide one s self in , no cunning policy here ; people laugh <UNK> , they weep for joy here .: 987.59
<S> have you that means ? it is to be found for the searching .: 44.98
<S> i have warned you !: 25.48
<S> has monsieur bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife , or for any other person ?: 46.26
<S> valentine , the time has arrived when you must answer me .: 130.66
<S> alas , alas ! said he to himself , misfortune is over my head ; my wife must have committed some frightful crime .: 46.18
<S> the two men , approaching the ends of the bed , took the sack by its extremities .: 58.65
<S> well , monsieur , said planchet , who had observed his master grow red and pale successively , did i not guess truly ?: 93.98
<S> no , but by <UNK> the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks . where can i sleep ? on shore in the grottos , or on board in your cloak ; besides , if your excellency pleases , we can leave as soon as you like we can sail as well by night as by day , and if the wind drops we can use our oars . as franz had sufficient time , and his apartments at rome were not yet available , he accepted the proposition .: 117.31
<S> you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse , with his elegant little rider , so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap , that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake ; and when i saw them <UNK> all the others , and come to the winning post in such gallant style , i actually clapped my hands with joy .: 161.66
<S> tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma , she replied , feeling , with true delicacy , that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saint me ran .: 66.63
<S> yet i let him die !: 55.99
<S> my lord , you are right , and i am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last .: 15.18
<S> the first prince of the blood , the king s uncle ! no !: 60.80
<S> as for me , so nervous , and so subject to fainting fits , i should require a doctor adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and <UNK> my mind , in the fear i have of dying some fine day of suffocation .: 304.84
<S> see what she writes to me , athos , said he .: 30.69
<S> i , madame , replied he , follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads , even were it on to death , without demanding wherefore ; but when it concerns your majesty s service , then , added he , looking at the queen with all the grace of former days , i precede the count . well , then , gentlemen , said the queen , since it is thus , and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned , this is what is required to be done for me .: 48.73
<S> and yet , said aramis , i am somewhat of porthos s opinion . is the king accustomed to give you such reasons ?: 44.29
<S> but is this all that is known ? they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him . on his track ? said villefort .: 43.60
<S> the mob had already assembled when the confession terminated .: 216.73
<S> athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached .: 302.62
<S> hereafter , perhaps , i shall have the right of giving myself ; at present i shall appear to sell myself . that is to say , you refuse to serve me , monsieur , said the cardinal , with a tone of vexation , through which , however , might be seen a sort of esteem ; remain free , then , and guard your <UNK> and your sympathies . monseigneur well , well , said the cardinal , i don t wish you any ill ; but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our friends .: 54.39
<S> wait here for me . and looking attentively around him , to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets , mazarin went out .: 62.83
<S> the day had begun to break when athos arose and dressed himself .: 74.40
<S> this done , he impatiently awaited the return of his companions .: 84.89
<S> would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose ? he inquired .: 92.39
<S> well , i will tell you .: 9.30
<S> sign the treaty , then , monseigneur , said aramis .: 25.01
<S> how ?: 28.72
<S> what a dreadful death what a blow !: 114.29
<S> do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience . <UNK> ? said lord wilmore , with that tone which is only known to natives of great britain .: 121.26
<S> morrel did not turn round he expected these words of cocles , the agent of thomson french . he placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth .: 75.20
<S> at the moment when peppino reached the foot of the mandai a , a priest arrived in some haste , forced his way through the soldiers , and , advancing to the chief of the brotherhood , gave him a folded paper .: 84.80
<S> thus , for instance , don t you in the first place want a horse ? yes , a horse . well , then !: 35.25
<S> and my only heir , are you not ? said lord de winter in his turn , fixing his eyes on those of milady .: 26.51
<S> pardon me , said he , smiling , pardon me my dear compatriot , but i had wholly forgotten you .: 43.13
<S> coquenard , whom porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the table .: 196.86
<S> the countess g wished to revive the subject of the count , but franz announced he had something far <UNK> to tell her , and , in spite of albert s demonstrations of false modesty , he informed the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days .: 81.81
<S> then the shots were repeated without regularity , but always aimed with the same accuracy .: 202.68
<S> but , at the same time , the intonation was so soft that , however strange the speech might seem , it was impossible to be offended at it .: 51.30
<S> be silent , dear du vallon , and resign yourself . adieu , gentlemen , said de comminges ; sleep well ! we will try . de comminges went away , d artagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation ; but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped porthos in his arms with an expression not to be doubted .: 72.48
<S> in the service of the four friends grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon .: 116.48
<S> is it possible that thomson french are not looked upon as safe and <UNK> bankers ?: 266.86
<S> i have filled those papers , and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto .: 73.08
<S> has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall ?: 278.81
<S> instead of improving these gifts , rarely granted so abundantly , this has been your course you have given yourself up to <UNK> and drunkenness , and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend . help ! cried caderousse ; i require a surgeon , not a priest ; perhaps i am not mortally wounded i may not die ; perhaps they can yet save my life . your wounds are so far mortal that , without the three drops i gave you , you would now be dead .: 164.47
<S> he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling , by sending relays of horses to chantilly , so that he might be in paris in five or six hours .: 116.73
<S> what is the matter ? exclaimed d artagnan , anxiously ; what has happened to you , my lord ? all is lost ! cried buckingham , becoming as pale as a corpse ; two of the studs are wanting , there are only ten . can you have lost them , my lord , or do you think they have been stolen ? they have been stolen , replied the duke , and it is the cardinal who has dealt this blow .: 28.11
<S> pronounced the famous , i have been almost obliged to wait . bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber , and cried in a hoarse voice : his excellency s horses ! monte cristo wrote two or three notes , and , as he sealed the last , the steward appeared .: 65.14
<S> athos walked about in a contemplative mood .: 107.89
<S> what do i see ? cried the lieutenant .: 11.75
<S> i persist , then , madame , in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word , that your majesty should receive the coadjutor . and wherefore do you not say , like the rest , your will ? replied the queen , in a low voice .: 39.53
<S> i endured the rain during the day , and the cold during the night tolerably well , but the third morning my horse died of cold .: 155.78
<S> i finish your phrase .: 227.13
<S> the stranger had written to lord wilmore , requesting an interview , which the latter had fixed for ten o clock .: 67.22
<S> then he determined to go up .: 26.63
<S> his eminence bent his brow , stopped for an instant , and then kept on his way without uttering a single word .: 24.22
<S> i have something to say to you . certainly , madame , said porthos , winking to himself , as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck .: 50.33
<S> but poor captain leclere what happened to him ? asked the owner , with an air of considerable resignation .: 45.32
<S> the general was stout and tall , the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down .: 81.55
<S> yes , but in my soul much more than in my body . we will save your soul , said the young man ; but are you really the executioner of bethune , as these people say ? that is to say , eagerly replied the wounded man , who doubtless feared that the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he could claim that is to say , i was , but am no longer ; it is fifteen years since i gave up the office .: 47.48
<S> everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred ; but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands .: 227.88
<S> at the same time , and with the rapidity of lightning , the stranger drew his .: 20.37
<S> what are these things ? he asked .: 13.32
<S> he returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd .: 105.12
<S> you ride on our lackey s horses , and have your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand , at short stages . at the same instant a market cart , which some minutes before had appeared upon the amiens road , pulled up at the inn , and planchet and grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads .: 148.82
<S> oh , believe me , that when three great passions , such as sorrow , love , and gratitude fill the heart , ennui can find no place . you are a worthy daughter of epirus , hayde e , and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of <UNK> who claim your country as their birthplace .: 213.72
<S> at the end of this time he gave up his search , and gaetano smiled .: 29.56
<S> i always knew you were a good son . and , inquired dante s , with some hesitation , do you know how my father is ? well , i believe , my dear edmond , though i have not seen him lately . yes , he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room . that proves , at least , that he has wanted for nothing during your absence . dante s smiled .: 37.68
<S> there , said he , drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds , there are the precious studs which i have taken an oath should be buried with me .: 75.62
<S> but to return to what we were saying .: 34.63
<S> at last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before mordaunt had been talking to cromwell .: 89.86
<S> aramis , look at that horse ! oh , the frightful brute ! said aramis .: 80.44
<S> milady seized the occasion .: 82.38
<S> la ramee made one movement , in order to satisfy his conscience .: 35.89
<S> i had no previous knowledge of your visit , had i ? indeed , you are such an extraordinary person , that i would not answer for it . at all events , i could not guess that you would invite me to dinner . probably not . well , listen , baptistin , what did i tell you this morning when i called you into my laboratory ? to close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five , replied the valet .: 49.85
<S> in reality , replied the latter , who , with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world , had penetrated at once all that was <UNK> in monte cristo , albert has not deceived us , for the count is a most singular being .: 77.27
<S> i know him for a norman , and <UNK> are obstinate . in fact , tightly held as he was , lubin endeavored still to cry out .: 147.97
<S> on the front of the monument was inscribed : the families of saint me ran and villefort , for such had been the last wish expressed by poor rene e , valentine s mother .: 130.87
<S> now , if you marry m. cavalcanti , and i get the three millions , or even if it is thought i am going to get them , my credit will be restored , and my fortune , which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in <UNK> which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality , will revive .: 79.47
<S> d artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood , finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarin s bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister s finger that night .: 92.20
<S> stop ! he said , there he is at his post . gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings ; a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand .: 69.77
<S> it was there a lodging was prepared for them .: 53.52
<S> dante s read it .: 21.32
<S> but do you see to what you are exposing yourself ? said the baroness .: 31.80
<S> this is the second or third time , monsieur , that you have repeated that name , and yet i have told you that i do not know him . you do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked ?: 32.71
<S> the beacon bathed with light the little <UNK> through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed arms .: 83.18
<S> once outside the city , d artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood .: 85.94
<S> monsieur , said mousqueton , who , abandoning his horse on the high road , had come on foot to rejoin his master , phoebus could no longer hold out and silence ! said porthos .: 51.64
<S> what would you have ? said the musketeer .: 11.21
<S> and you are going to portsmouth ? i have no time to lose .: 17.97
<S> the latter , faithful to the principle of horace , <UNK> <UNK> , had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught .: 372.58
<S> well , then , madame , yes , i did feel fear ; and though i have been through twelve pitched battles and i can not count how many charges and <UNK> , i own for the third time in my life i was afraid .: 98.20
<S> the morrel family in a very few minutes the count reached no .: 115.50
<S> to take mazarin . athos curled his lip with disdain .: 164.58
<S> where shall we pass the night ? he inquired .: 25.69
<S> i am frightful tonight , she said .: 30.26
<S> his next care on leaving the barber s who had achieved his first <UNK> was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor s suit a garb , as we all know , very simple , and consisting of white trousers , a striped shirt , and a cap .: 249.70
<S> where your life was spared ! for shame !: 138.02
<S> a conjugal scene as athos had foreseen , it was not long before the cardinal came down .: 78.07
<S> m. coquenard had , since the arrival of porthos , frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak desk .: 107.78
<S> albert was soon deeply engrossed in <UNK> upon paris and parisian matters , speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there .: 288.28
<S> now , as i am not egotistical , we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her . you have determined , then , to abandon her to the common law ? said carlini .: 51.91
<S> a dripping pan immediately , that i may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird . you was right , said the swiss ; goose grease is <UNK> with <UNK> . there ! said the dragoon .: 182.95
<S> to morrow , rather , said de chatillon , if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of charenton . how can you doubt it , sir ?: 39.96
<S> two hours passed away .: 13.71
<S> what next ?: 29.33
<S> by leaving this light on the right , he kept the island of tiboulen a little on the left ; by turning to the left , therefore , he would find it .: 59.56
<S> as for the count , he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him .: 43.42
<S> who could have thought it ?: 31.56
<S> at the end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered , descending from the palazzo di venezia to the piazza del popolo , and mounting from the piazza del popolo to the palazzo di venezia .: 32.67
<S> i have accustomed myself to regard you as my son : well , then , to save my son , i will sacrifice my life , nay , even my fortune . what do you mean ? i mean , that you wish to quit life because you do not understand all the enjoyments which are the fruits of a large fortune .: 43.13
<S> conferences .: 217.06
<S> nevertheless , he pressed d artagnan s hand , and said to him : you are an honest youth ; but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered .: 39.52
<S> bonacieux ; i say that i have reflected ; i renew the affair ; i obtain the letter , and i run directly to the cardinal . well , go quickly !: 50.72
<S> what shall i do now ? nothing . it is finished , then ? no , not yet . i should like to understand , said porthos .: 25.27
<S> the idea was not that of a christian , i knew ; but without doubt , that eternal enemy of our souls , that lion roaring constantly around us , breathed it into my mind .: 156.17
<S> he was introduced .: 27.98
<S> god preserved me , but a man named brisemont died in my place . we bear witness to this , said porthos and aramis , in the same manner as before .: 74.83
<S> it would be a still worse affair for mazarin , whom he execrated for the greater <UNK> he had committed .: 142.84
<S> they had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on , that they might not fail at the appointed place .: 40.36
<S> the house was of white stone , and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers .: 81.83
<S> he had , moreover , <UNK> bound on his feet by <UNK> .: 172.62
<S> the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead ; he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face , and just unclosed the lips .: 126.06
<S> i carry no sword this morning and can not return home to procure one . no , said lord de winter , we are going to pay a visit to her majesty the queen of england . oh , very well , replied aramis ; then bending his face down to athos s ear , what is the object of this visit ? continued he .: 30.18
<S> and why do you rush in here , as if you were about to penetrate a crowded market place ? my lord , replied the messenger , i wish to speak to your eminence in secret .: 54.37
<S> my mother was a christian , and she prayed .: 28.32
<S> the usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door , and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the rue de vaugirard .: 50.65
<S> at that moment mme .: 14.36
<S> i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock , and in the light of the sun its black arms , bending in every direction , always reminded me of the claws of an immense <UNK> , and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it , for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity , and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the <UNK> of the message .: 98.46
<S> at length the boat touched the shore , but without effort , without shock , as lips touch lips ; and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody .: 374.83
<S> he loi se ! he cried .: 8.60
<S> you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer . the arguments , and his audacity , perfectly stupefied me .: 79.38
<S> he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet .: 60.80
<S> they traced her to cha lons , and there they lost her . they lost her ? yes , forever . madame danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh , a tear , or a shriek for every detail .: 102.68
<S> the boat sailed on all day and all night , and next morning , when the sun rose , they had lost sight of monte cristo .: 52.08
<S> bonacieux , against buckingham , but above all against d artagnan projects lost in the distance of the future .: 163.66
<S> let us choose a place of rendezvous , continued athos , and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other . good ! the other three exclaimed .: 139.81
<S> during this time the empire made its last <UNK> , and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor .: 168.43
<S> for example , look at the <UNK> procureur , who has just lost his daughter , and in fact nearly all his family , in so singular a manner ; morcerf dishonored and dead ; and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto ; besides besides what ? asked the count .: 138.44
<S> beware of a profane taste in your theological style .: 448.90
<S> sire , go , leave france to its real master , to him who acquired it , not by purchase , but by right of conquest ; go , sire , not that you incur any risk , for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy , but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of saint louis to owe his life to the man of <UNK> , marengo , austerlitz . tell him this , ge rard ; or , rather , tell him nothing .: 163.70
<S> it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other .: 19.12
<S> who should it be but he who watches while i sleep , who labors while i amuse myself , who <UNK> everything at home and abroad in france as in europe ? your majesty probably refers to god , said m. de tre ville ; for i know no one except god who can be so far above your majesty . no , monsieur ; i speak of the <UNK> of the state , of my only servant , of my only friend of the cardinal . his eminence is not his holiness , sire . what do you mean by that , monsieur ? that it is only the pope who is infallible , and that this <UNK> does not extend to cardinals . you mean to say that he deceives me ; you mean to say that he betrays me ?: 95.39
<S> i was there .: 19.69
<S> well , out of the five or six millions which form your real capital , you have just lost nearly two millions , which must , of course , in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune ; to follow out my <UNK> , your skin has been opened by bleeding , and this if repeated three or four times will cause death so pay attention to it , my dear monsieur danglars .: 128.46
<S> d artagnan s intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer ; but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged , not only to stop , but to enter into conversation with him .: 82.27
<S> it was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the king .: 25.69
<S> parry , odious as was this sight to him , sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise ; and fixed on two men , who were <UNK> the last <UNK> of the iron balcony .: 206.97
<S> bring six of them . why , this man is a cask ! said the host , aside .: 53.51
<S> the principal thing for her , then , was , as we have said , to keep mme .: 47.78
<S> is it broken off ? yesterday morning , it appears , franz declined the honor . indeed ?: 154.36
<S> what , said the notary , do you not intend making mademoiselle valentine de villefort your <UNK> <UNK> ? no . you are not making any mistake , are you ? said the notary ; you really mean to declare that such is not your intention ? no , repeated noirtier ; no . valentine raised her head , struck dumb with astonishment .: 67.20
<S> i own that this woman terrifies me . shall you have the courage ? said athos .: 44.91
<S> come in , said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant , whom he found lying on a kind of <UNK> bed .: 53.99
<S> i am with the person to whom this letter was addressed , and to whom i desired to prove that luigi vampa was a man of his word .: 29.55
<S> in politics , my dear fellow , you know , as well as i do , there are no men , but ideas no feelings , but interests ; in politics we do not kill a man , we only remove an obstacle , that is all .: 65.93
<S> come here , fellow . bazin , who was crossing the ante chamber majestically in his <UNK> dress , turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him ; but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them .: 138.09
<S> baptistin left the room without waiting to answer , and in two seconds reappeared , bringing on a <UNK> , all that his master had ordered , ready prepared , and appearing to have sprung from the ground , like the <UNK> which we read of in fairy tales .: 130.44
<S> she knew him ; she knew that at her return from a fruitless journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment , in vain to <UNK> upon the sufferings she had undergone .: 73.05
<S> what must the <UNK> , restless , suspicious cardinal think of her silence the cardinal , not merely her only support , her only <UNK> , her only protector at present , but still further , the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance ?: 299.74
<S> with a slight inclination of the head , danglars signed to the count to be seated , pointing significantly to a gilded armchair , covered with white satin embroidered with gold .: 55.47
<S> you have promised me to go , said the queen .: 10.28
<S> we listen , monsieur athos . yes , the wager ! said the light horseman .: 37.79
<S> all that , however , has nothing to do with my obligations to you , and i now come to ask you whether , in my own person , my family , or connections , i can in any way serve you ?: 48.91
<S> i was at the end of my journey and of my credit .: 23.02
<S> his insolent bravery , his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail , had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called court favor , which he had climbed four steps at a time .: 398.51
<S> a short time ago , while making researches in the royal library for my history of louis xiv. , i stumbled by chance upon the memoirs of m. d artagnan , printed as were most of the works of that period , in which <UNK> could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence , more or less long , in the bastille at amsterdam , by pierre rouge .: 165.84
<S> he hurt my shoulder .: 197.78
<S> then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him , and led her respectfully back to the door .: 79.94
<S> now , said d artagnan , i ve one last favor to ask of you , monsieur de comminges . at your service , sir . you will see the count again ? to morrow morning . will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained ? you want the cardinal to come here ? no ; i know my place and am not so presumptuous .: 44.37
<S> the abbe s chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage , which , however , did not admit of their holding themselves erect , the two friends reached the further end of the corridor , into which the abbe s cell opened ; from that point the passage became much <UNK> , and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees .: 178.05
<S> the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by a french officer named fernand , in whom the grand vizier , ali tepelini , had <UNK> the greatest confidence . well , said monte cristo , what do you see in that to annoy you ? what do i see in it ? yes ; what does it signify to you if the castle of yanina was given up by a french officer ? it signifies to my father , the count of morcerf , whose christian name is fernand ! did your father serve under ali pasha ? yes ; that is to say , he fought for the independence of the greeks , and hence arises the calumny . oh , my dear viscount , do talk reason ! i do not desire to do otherwise . now , just tell me who the devil should know in france that the officer fernand and the count of morcerf are one and the same person ?: 68.82
<S> jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present , which dante s hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family , who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend ; but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune , left him by an uncle , whose sole heir he was .: 128.21
<S> toward eleven o clock the king entered the hall , surrounded by guards , but wearing his head covered , and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance , as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects , rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court .: 108.08
<S> well , the abbe adelmonte took a rabbit , and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage .: 69.56
<S> instead of raising it , thought he , they have lowered it .: 79.53
<S> wait , my dear father , said the young man , one word more . say on . however stupid the royalist police may be , they do know one terrible thing . what is that ? the description of the man who , on the morning of the day when general quesnel disappeared , presented himself at his house . oh , the admirable police have found that out , have they ?: 102.16
<S> lovely as the greek girls of <UNK> or <UNK> , merce de s boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet , and ripe , round , coral lips .: 562.16
<S> how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head ?: 45.85
<S> he was the same man , or rather the <UNK> of the same man , whom we have <UNK> seen as assistant attorney at marseilles .: 113.40
<S> the two children met , sat down near each other , let their flocks mingle together , played , laughed , and conversed together ; in the evening they separated the count of san felice s flock from those of baron <UNK> , and the children returned to their respective <UNK> , promising to meet the next morning .: 123.29
<S> i am in a fever , said she ; i have not slept a single instant during all this long night .: 39.83
<S> and now , he said , after today , you will come and live with me ; you can occupy hayde e s apartment , and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son . hayde e ? said morrel , what has become of her ? she departed last night . to leave you ? to wait for me .: 37.06
<S> we have no time to lose ; i will question , and do you answer me . noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer .: 21.16
<S> monsieur de beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to monsieur de chavigny , saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended , but in three months it should be repeated , when pistache would have learned a few new tricks .: 80.87
<S> villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business ; he soon , however , returned , his whole face beaming with delight .: 150.72
<S> save me !: 26.39
<S> see , it is on fire yet with his hot blood , for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound . and grimaud threw the dagger on the table .: 78.79
<S> alas , alas , murmured he , if the procureur himself had been at marseilles i should have been ruined .: 34.45
<S> he had spent every <UNK> that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father .: 151.00
<S> oh , so much the better , we will fire the first shot together . it is well ; be friends , said the tutor ; young as you both are , you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to meet .: 71.25
<S> she stopped astonished , then the voice reached her ear more distinctly , and she recognized it to be that of maximilian .: 67.78
<S> you met a monk , did you not ? yes . the young men looked at each other with an expression of fear .: 15.78
<S> yes , since she lives . at that moment d avrigny s glance met noirtier s eye .: 46.91
<S> the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house , and he remained silent and pensive , forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation , which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged .: 45.47
<S> perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for <UNK> the fallen king , and who , learning that the king was about to flee and escape him , threw himself in the way , with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand , not as substitute for the executioner , but as an ambassador of fate . possibly . and if that were the case would your honor condemn his action ? it is not for me to judge .: 104.47
<S> thanks , replied the jeweller .: 26.17
<S> but though i can not give my own name , not possessing one , i can tell them my father s .: 45.05
<S> are you asleep , that you don t answer when i ring ? and d artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently .: 74.32
<S> then , through the grating to which she had drawn near , milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor , and depart in an apparent transport of joy .: 118.76
<S> every time he passed with a friend before his windows , at one of which mousqueton was sure to be placed in full livery , porthos raised his head and his hand , and said , that is my abode ! but he was never to be found at home ; he never invited anybody to go up with him , and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches .: 64.71
<S> you remind me of my fright !: 51.59
<S> come , then , said d artagnan , you are right .: 5.34
<S> well , said franz , anything new ? do they refuse ? on the contrary , returned gaetano , the chief , who was told you were a young frenchman , invites you to sup with him . well , observed franz , this chief is very polite , and i see no objection the more so as i bring my share of the supper . oh , it is not that ; he has plenty , and to spare , for supper ; but he makes one condition , and rather a peculiar one , before he will receive you at his house . his house ?: 64.08
<S> he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping .: 91.79

<S> how should he have been otherwise ?: 53.58
<S> about fifty paces off , another man , also <UNK> as a cavalier , was talking to a scotch sentinel , and , though a foreigner , he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad <UNK> dialect .: 205.01
<S> so , after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply , la ramee , fascinated by this sobriety in speech , rubbed his hands and engaged grimaud .: 182.86
<S> thanks for the comparison , said albert , with a bow .: 30.19
<S> he has returned , said he .: 13.33
<S> a tall , pale clerk , his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair , opened the door , and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature , which indicated strength , the military dress , which indicated rank , and a <UNK> countenance , which indicated familiarity with good living .: 188.57
<S> he was quite prepared for any such encounter .: 60.14
<S> woman was created for our destruction , and it is from her we inherit all our miseries . at this speech of aramis , the brow of athos became clouded and he bit his lips .: 166.28
<S> well , sir , exclaimed mazarin , what s the matter ?: 12.30
<S> the journey chapter <UNK> .: 80.48
<S> jussac was , as was then said , a fine blade , and had had much practice ; nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who , active and energetic , departed every instant from received rules , attacking him on all sides at once , and yet <UNK> like a man who had the greatest respect for his own <UNK> .: 192.10
<S> i was generally liked on board , and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves , i feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me .: 146.09
<S> you will make some desirable acquaintances ; and from time to time you can call upon me , just to tell me how you are getting on , and to say whether i can be of further service to you . d artagnan , stranger as he was to all the manners of a court , could not but perceive a little coldness in this reception .: 65.54
<S> in all probability , this time his master would not retract .: 50.64
<S> ah , my friend , said he , it is all the better if you are in difficulties . how is it all the better ? yes , for his eminence will give you all that you want land , money , and titles . ah !: 29.47
<S> well , i had promised madame de villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the bois ; but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gone positively gone .: 132.41
<S> that s exactly what my wife said , monseigneur . do you know who carried off your wife ? no , monseigneur . you have suspicions , nevertheless ? yes , monseigneur ; but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to monsieur the commissary , and i no longer have them . your wife has escaped .: 56.49
<S> and who is the cause of all this annoyance ? my father , as i told you . m .: 24.90
<S> port wine !: 81.22
<S> but , no !: 24.05
<S> the bed had iron clamps , but they were <UNK> to the wood , and it would have required a screw driver to take them off .: 150.42
<S> he did not take in the paper containing the <UNK> article , and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse .: 155.03
<S> you know his success our dear duke ?: 146.21
<S> we shall meet soon , i trust , in paris , where you shall have your revenge . the duke , as he spoke , kissed his hand , spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared , followed by his troop , who were soon lost in distance and darkness .: 45.17
<S> he sees us on the road which leads him to a <UNK> , and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way . ah , as regards aramis , that is another thing , said porthos , and it wouldn t surprise me at all . perhaps monsieur de beaufort will try , in his turn , to lay hands on us . nonsense !: 39.19
<S> i will make the journey on purpose to see him , if it is worth while . at this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder , accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid , that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp .: 54.64
<S> be satisfied with being a plain , straightforward citizen , and turn to that side which offers the most advantages . eh , eh ! said bonacieux , <UNK> a plump , round bag , which returned of sound a money ; what do you think of this , madame preacher ? whence comes that money ? you do not guess ? from the cardinal ? from him , and from my friend the comte de rochefort . the comte de rochefort !: 119.30
<S> by my father s tomb , said he , extending his hand over the head of the young girl , i swear to you , hayde e , that if any misfortune happens , it will not be to me . i believe you , my lord , as implicitly as if god had spoken to me , said the young girl , presenting her forehead to him .: 23.29
<S> did you pass through the corso ? yes . well , did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask , and one with white damask with a red cross ?: 59.71
<S> the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing . it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply ; not only was he the elder , but he had been presented to the prince by his father .: 79.37
<S> do you know what he has done , this child ?: 17.24
<S> neither dared for some time to speak in that room .: 73.90
<S> i think a little exertion would do me good . the two friends walked out on the fortress .: 69.84
<S> oh , my former friends , my former friends ! he murmured , and fell with his face to the ground .: 31.09
<S> officer meanwhile , the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england ; but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening .: 199.98
<S> bazin obeyed , fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to planchet , who then went satisfied to his shed .: 183.73
<S> the judges themselves appeared to be stupefied , and the jury manifested tokens of disgust for a <UNK> so unexpected in a man of fashion .: 233.25
<S> i will make you all captains , with good pensions !: 140.00
<S> but after all , said lord de winter , when the three friends had been named , we do not know who you are .: 19.82
<S> oh , if i were only there to help him ! suddenly another idea took possession of his mind , so used to misfortune , that it was scarcely capable of hope the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon .: 107.41
<S> i , too , would give up that good monsieur broussel , dead or alive , and all would be at an end . if you yield him dead , all will indeed be at an end , my lord , but quite otherwise than you mean . did i say dead or alive ? replied mazarin .: 81.19
<S> he was of middle height ; but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers .: 229.96
<S> on seeing the queen , the men stopped short , respectfully .: 63.57
<S> silence , whispered the duke , she has her reasons . she will ruin us ! returned the prince .: 49.66
<S> i only ask you one favor ; and if you grant it me , i will bless you in this world and in the next . speak to the master , madame , said felton ; happily i am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor <UNK> .: 73.78
<S> doctor , doctor ! cried barrois , who felt another fit coming .: 80.32
<S> debray rose , smiling , and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point , when the door opened suddenly .: 72.00
<S> well , said the young woman , what you dreaded has happened .: 27.74
<S> it may be supposed that dante s did not now think of his dinner , but he insisted that his comrades , who had not his reasons for fasting , should have their meal .: 50.08
<S> take in two <UNK> in the top sails , cried the captain ; let go the <UNK> s , haul the brace , lower the top gallant sails , haul out the <UNK> <UNK> on the yards . <UNK> that was not enough for those latitudes , said the englishman ; i should have taken four <UNK> in the topsails and <UNK> the <UNK> . his firm , sonorous , and unexpected voice made everyone start .: 447.80
<S> if the letter must be written under your censure , my faith , i renounce the task . and you will do right .: 78.70
<S> she asked upon what day this fe te would take place , but the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head .: 84.56
<S> madame du vallon was of doubtful <UNK> .: 209.15
<S> i am monsieur d artagnan , a gascon gentleman , serving in the king s musketeers .: 28.10
<S> if the stranger expected to produce an effect on morrel , he was not mistaken maximilian started as if he had been electrified .: 118.58
<S> franz remarked , while he gave these details , that albert seemed to have something to ask of him , but that he was unwilling to ask it .: 40.37
<S> everything that savors of mystery charms them .: 559.19
<S> this astonishment was doubled when aramis saw athos fill a <UNK> and <UNK> it off with all his former enthusiasm .: 413.88
<S> emmanuel went towards the pistols .: 55.41
<S> a second discharge followed the first , and three balls , by passing through it , made the napkin really a flag .: 155.52
<S> his first cry was for his father ; but that father was dead . my father , too , is dead , said morrel .: 31.08
<S> yes , i have , replied franz ; i am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered . c sar s commentaries , said the bandit , it is my favorite work . well , are you coming ? asked albert .: 42.29
<S> no , madame , they struck me , always struck me !: 47.46
<S> the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive .: 319.17
<S> the crowd opened and closed again , undulating like a stormy sea , and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of athos .: 99.00
<S> no doubt , now , we shall hear that our friend is released ! merce de s and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door .: 36.80
<S> we are lost ! in the meantime , the ferryboat had floated away , carried down by the stream , and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more .: 90.39
<S> no , in truth you are no visionary , my dear friend , and now i think of it you yes , i faith , you re right those delicate , yet firm set lips , those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart !: 111.21
<S> however , i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am <UNK> ; five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble , and especially in france , where , it seems , it is forbidden to beat the postilions . my dear count , replied albert , i was announcing your visit to some of my friends , whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make , and whom i now present to you .: 52.54
<S> the ship drew on and had safely passed the <UNK> , which some <UNK> shock has made between the <UNK> and jaros islands ; had doubled <UNK> gue , and approached the harbor under topsails , jib , and <UNK> , but so slowly and <UNK> that the idlers , with that instinct which is the <UNK> of evil , asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board .: 508.22
<S> the initials are only mine c .: 1370.29
<S> now , he added , rising in the stirrups and looking about him , which , i wonder , is the lightning ? at this moment , as if in reply to his words , a man lying on a <UNK> of <UNK> rose and advanced a few steps toward him .: 65.19
<S> gentlemen , once more , take him to prison , and keep him under key as long as possible ; that will give me time to pay him . the officers were full of thanks , and took away their prey .: 63.40
<S> in spite of all appearances , be so kind , therefore , as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law . let the irons be heated , said the doctor ; but really it is a useless precaution . this order to heat the irons made dante s shudder .: 148.97
<S> why , that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known . why so ? because i am believed to be dead , and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living ; so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from <UNK> over the fields . the englishman looked at athos , believing that he jested , but athos did not jest the least in the world .: 68.42
<S> he was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color , with aiguillettes of the same color , without any other ornaments than the customary slashes , through which the shirt appeared .: 120.15
<S> well ? asked d artagnan .: 5.59
<S> doctor , my house is accursed ! what ? said the latter with apparent coolness , but with deep emotion , have you another invalid ? yes , doctor , cried villefort , clutching his hair , yes ! d avrigny s look implied , i told you it would be so . then he slowly uttered these words , who is now dying in your house ?: 73.23
<S> the baroness was partially reclining on a sofa , euge nie sat near her , and cavalcanti was standing .: 61.20
<S> there was a very simple means of <UNK> himself whither mme .: 127.09
<S> she will save us , said conti .: 67.51
<S> there are , indeed , some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant .: 55.03
<S> by his manner , sir , and his age ; he s the second to day . has a young man , such as i am , gone through this morning , then ? asked raoul .: 50.45
<S> since when , i wonder , in the musketeers , did they grant men leave of absence without their asking for it ? since , said d artagnan , they have friends who ask it for them . ah , ah ! said porthos , it appears there s something fresh here . yes , we are going said aramis .: 61.98
<S> now , to see things which i can not understand , to procure impossibilities , these are the study of my life .: 61.53
<S> believe me , dear albert , he said , with all the emotion he was capable of feeling , believe me , i feel deeply for your misfortunes , and if in any way i can serve you , i am yours . thank you , sir , said albert , smiling .: 25.81
<S> the truth was , that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival , with the holy week that was to succeed it , so filled every fair breast , as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage .: 137.91
<S> he , that man ! what man ? that cursed man , my evil genius , whom i have always met with when threatened by some misfortune , he who accompanied that horrible woman when i met her for the first time , he whom i was seeking when i offended our athos , he whom i saw on the very morning madame bonacieux was abducted .: 109.30
<S> impossible . they appear to be numerous . then tis something else . another horse ! said porthos .: 92.24
<S> and you would be right , my friend ; for in losing him you would lose your barony , which you have in your grasp , to say nothing of the fact that , were he once out of this , mazarin would have you hanged . do you think so ? i am sure of it . then i would kill him rather than let him go . and you would act rightly .: 53.01
<S> athos followed the footman , who led him through a long succession of apartments and paused at length before a closed door .: 91.20
<S> when they entered the port , it was already night .: 34.86
<S> monsieur d artagnan ! he cried ; vade <UNK> <UNK> ! so , my dear bazin ! said the officer , laughing , this is the way you receive an old friend . sir , replied bazin , the true friends of a christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation , not those who hinder him in doing so . i don t understand you , bazin ; nor can i see how i can be a stumbling block in the way of your salvation , said d artagnan .: 85.71
<S> hayde e was reclining upon soft downy cushions , covered with blue satin spotted with silver ; her head , supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms , rested on the divan immediately behind her , while the other was employed in <UNK> to her lips the coral <UNK> of a rich <UNK> , through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water .: 236.53
<S> the noise had ceased ; but it seemed that morrel expected something something had occasioned the noise , and something must follow .: 105.81
<S> mousqueton s horse rejoined them , and galloped by the side of his companions .: 35.16
<S> we must first extract the steel from the side , said he , shaking his head in a significant manner .: 44.11
<S> if you go on so , his eminence will be forced to renew his company in three weeks , and i to put the edicts in force in all their <UNK> .: 105.69
<S> he was passing the chinese baths , and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte saint martin , and to be going towards the madeleine .: 56.21
<S> suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops , who were entering , <UNK> <UNK> , the <UNK> with the fugitives .: 343.14
<S> m. de villefort heard of him at marseilles , and m. danglars recollects having seen him .: 42.90
<S> fortune <UNK> her smiles upon you ; do not let her flee from your embrace .: 323.71
<S> and now , he said , when he saw that dante s had read the last line , put the two fragments together , and judge for yourself . dante s obeyed , and the <UNK> pieces gave the following : <UNK> this 25th day of april , 1498 , be ... ing invited to dine by his holiness alexander vi. , and fearing that not ... content with making me pay for my hat , he may desire to become my heir , and re ... serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara and bentivoglio , who were poisoned , ... i declare to my nephew , guido spada , my sole heir , that i have bu ... ried in a place he knows and has visited with me , that is , in ... the caves of the small island of monte cristo , all i poss ... essed of ingots , gold , money , jewels , diamonds , gems ; that i alone ... know of the existence of this treasure , which may amount to nearly two mil ... lions of roman crowns , and which he will find on raising the twentieth ro ... ck from the small creek to the east in a right line .: 137.85
<S> to see this woman , so beautiful , fair as the brightest vision , to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening ; to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and beauty it was too much for a visionary ; it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith ; it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns , by the hatred of men that <UNK> .: 143.96
<S> yes , my lord . apropos , what are the names of your friends ? the count de la fere , formerly styled athos ; monsieur du vallon , whom we used to call porthos ; the chevalier d herblay , now the abbe d herblay , whom we styled aramis the cardinal smiled .: 39.48
<S> then a low door was opened before him , and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock .: 53.76
<S> it is six o clock , said madame de villefort , evidently agitated .: 12.05
<S> at half past one they descended , the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises , which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever , and which gained them the applause of franz and albert .: 74.08
<S> a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting , albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs e lyse es , which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the count s princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences .: 122.17
<S> thanks thanks ; but , fortunately , i do not want for anything ; and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me . dante s made a gesture .: 81.84
<S> all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse , and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone .: 35.48
<S> it is a prison within a prison ; the walls are double the <UNK> of the rest .: 97.03
<S> swords , then ! cried aramis , swords !: 67.83
<S> no matter ; he is an excellent fellow , and we must not leave him .: 21.30
<S> ah , this letter gives me an idea a capital idea !: 58.26
<S> run to torlonia , draw from him instantly four thousand piastres , and give them to the bearer .: 113.41
<S> adieu , monsieur de rochefort , he said .: 12.88
<S> who sent away madame de chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign ? a woman of intrigue , who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against m. de richelieu . who dismissed madame de <UNK> , that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine ? a <UNK> , who told you every night , as she <UNK> you , that it was a sin to love a priest , just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal . who ordered monsieur de beaufort to be arrested ? an incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me . you see , cardinal , replied the queen , that your enemies are mine . that is not enough madame , it is necessary that your friends should be also mine . my friends , monsieur ? the queen shook her head .: 116.36
<S> she fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed .: 71.90
<S> the queen looked at him , surprised .: 20.52
<S> yes . but the contract ? the same smile returned .: 63.56
<S> madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness ; then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl s heart .: 68.26
<S> nevertheless , one day when monsieur de beaufort was walking in the <UNK> his fire was put out , his <UNK> all removed , taken away ; and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed .: 204.35
<S> bonacieux ; and your regiment , your captain ? by my soul , you had made me forget all that , dear constance !: 54.00
<S> hayde e s only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir , the framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young girl s picturesque attitude and appearance .: 189.42
<S> milady felt that she stood in need of all her strength .: 26.85
<S> oh ! said athos to himself , is it indeed possible that i hear what i hear and that i see what i see ?: 40.74
<S> do you see that street ?: 45.10
<S> but this is droll , cried d artagnan , consoled , and holding his sides with laughter .: 68.81
<S> i wish to speak with monsieur aramis .: 17.04
<S> the monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man .: 22.43
<S> the english , who require , above everything , good living in order to be good soldiers , only eating salt meat and bad biscuit , had many <UNK> in their camp .: 413.89
<S> but do not be uneasy ; even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent , you can not well mistake him ; he will enter by this door .: 58.39
<S> enough !: 73.89
<S> stay , count , he added , you , who may be called the emperor , if i claim the title of king of finance , have you many pieces of paper of this size , each worth a million ? the count took into his hands the papers , which danglars had so proudly presented to him , and read : to the governor of the bank .: 58.18
<S> i should never have thought of that , said porthos , and yet it is very simple . come , aramis , said d artagnan , write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to marie michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the duke of buckingham . mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing .: 64.34
<S> athos and aramis left paris after this <UNK> d <UNK> , which took place on the very evening of the day in which the parisians had been beaten at charenton .: 84.04
<S> at each corner were arranged trophies , presenting to view swords of all sorts , and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the cardinal de lorraine , the cardinal de richelieu , the cardinal de la valette , and the archbishop of bordeaux .: 243.41
<S> milady , on the contrary , was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues , amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years .: 60.89
<S> tre ville , added the king , in a low voice , as the others were retiring , as you have no room in the musketeers , and as we have besides decided that a novitiate is necessary before entering that corps , place this young man in the company of the guards of monsieur dessessart , your brother in law .: 67.76
<S> porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles .: 51.82
<S> yes ; you see i am as exact as you are .: 25.20
<S> at this sigh felton turned round .: 67.36
<S> silence , d artagnan ! said athos .: 10.88
<S> planchet glared <UNK> over the back of his armchair .: 320.48
<S> besides , what would the sailors say ?: 50.69
<S> conclusion epilogue author s preface in which it is proved that , notwithstanding their names ending in <UNK> and is , the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor to relate to our readers have nothing <UNK> about them .: 203.51
<S> but i did so because i was happy , because i had not <UNK> death , because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible , because i was unwilling that i , a creature made for the service of god , should serve for food to the <UNK> and <UNK> .: 148.93
<S> the next day must clear up every doubt ; and unless his near neighbor and would be friend , the count of monte cristo , possessed the ring of <UNK> , and by its power was able to render himself invisible , it was very certain he could not escape this time .: 116.92
<S> certainly not , exclaimed mazarin .: 49.89
<S> on the contrary , observed d artagnan , with a vexed look ; it would be impossible . how so ? it is precisely this monsieur mordaunt whom we are going to join at boulogne and with whom we cross to england . well , suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join our friends ? said porthos , with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army .: 63.05
<S> it was at this moment that people came <UNK> to the scene of action from all sides .: 78.73
<S> amongst the catalans , merce de s wished for a thousand things , but still she never really wanted any .: 121.11
<S> i am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested , and in an hour i shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister . i am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence , first , because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results .: 52.02
<S> we need hardly add that these peasant costumes , like those of the young women , were brilliant with gold and jewels .: 80.51
<S> he now calls himself the count of morcerf , and ranks among the peers . thus the terrible secret , which beauchamp had so generously destroyed , appeared again like an armed phantom ; and another paper , deriving its information from some malicious source , had published two days after albert s departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy .: 241.12
<S> the <UNK> of the bouquet kept her word ; she gave albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after .: 179.40
<S> no , said she , withdrawing it gently no , my friend , touch me not .: 86.97
<S> thou hast done well ! returned the old man in a hoarse voice ; embrace me , my son . <UNK> carlini threw himself , sobbing like a child , into the arms of his mistress s father .: 54.18
<S> he saw her get into her carriage , and heard her order the coachman to drive to st. germain .: 45.26
<S> the matter is gallant .: 80.89
<S> this means , sire , replied the cardinal , that i was desirous of presenting her majesty with these two studs , and that not daring to offer them myself , i adopted this means of inducing her to accept them . and i am the more grateful to your eminence , replied anne of austria , with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry , from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his majesty . then saluting the king and the cardinal , the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed , and where she was to take off her costume .: 53.39
<S> in the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two kingdoms .: 38.33
<S> it is indeed thee ! yes , yes , constance .: 39.99
<S> only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes ! who told you that i had been weeping ? said she .: 126.81
<S> the terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst , like a clap of thunder , over the head of the guilty .: 71.22
<S> i have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties , i retained the sense of my danger .: 51.35
<S> what would you have me say ? give all the information in your power . tell me on which point you desire information , and i will tell all i know ; only , added he , with a smile , i warn you i know very little . have you served under the usurper ? i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell . it is reported your political opinions are extreme , said villefort , who had never heard anything of the kind , but was not sorry to make this inquiry , as if it were an accusation .: 53.69
<S> look at it , and tell me what you think of it . what a wicked looking , crooked staircase , said cha teau renaud with a smile .: 32.36
<S> he glanced around this second grotto ; it was , like the first , empty .: 77.93
<S> he did not then think of the carnival , for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness , one can not incline one s self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called <UNK> xvi .: 193.16
<S> have you lost your heart ? indeed , i fear it , replied andrea , in the tone in which he had heard <UNK> or vale re reply to <UNK> at the the a tre franc ais .: 137.90
<S> the sergeant , with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity , said : who are you , gentlemen ? two gentlemen . and where do you come from ? from london . and what are you going to do in paris ? we are going with a mission to her majesty , the queen of england . ah , every one seems to be going to see the queen of england .: 47.87
<S> then , too , my father is not a person whose orders may be <UNK> with impunity ; protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and <UNK> integrity , no one could oppose him ; he is all powerful even with the king ; he would crush you at a word .: 148.75
<S> out , even to me ? i know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte , said baptistin ; and i should therefore never think of including him in any general order . you are right ; and now i wish to see him on an affair of great importance .: 94.40
<S> how , madame ! said the valet , in the same carriage as your majesties ? it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening , but of the king s safety .: 39.64
<S> no , no look , look ! <UNK> the recommendation was needless .: 149.45
<S> i felt pain ; i wished to cry out , but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice ; i fell lifeless , and fancied myself killed .: 115.37
<S> nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states .: 25.45
<S> bertuccio s forehead was covered with perspiration ; however , he obeyed , and , leaning out of the window , he cried to the coachman , rue de la fontaine , no .: 31.25
<S> edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour , and returned to his couch he did not wish to die .: 54.79
<S> for ever and ever ! cried the youth ; oh !: 116.25
<S> now i belong to this last named class ; and certainly my prospects of military <UNK> are most encouraging as well as certain .: 315.98
<S> what was all that to scarron ?: 67.28
<S> monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked .: 127.17
<S> that knife was for you , my lad ; she would have killed you .: 43.14
<S> anne of austria returned to her oratory , furious .: 35.84
<S> now the successor of pere marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl , and chambertin wine instead of macon .: 178.02
<S> in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines ; this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch ; once there , a large excavation would be made , and one of the flag stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier , who , stunned by his fall , would be immediately bound and gagged by dante s before he had power to offer any resistance .: 182.24
<S> he said yes and he put his hand on his sword .: 26.79
<S> keep back , my lord , said d artagnan .: 12.30
<S> what more do you want ? and she fell full length on the floor .: 44.95
<S> that letter you have received , and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse well ? it is a forgery . how can that be ? yes , a forgery ; it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you . but it is d artagnan that will come . do not deceive yourself .: 58.63
<S> porthos was the first who came to himself .: 36.96
<S> we have plenty of thieves , though not so many as is said ; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a <UNK> than a lord .: 194.29
<S> i consent on condition that la ramee tries them with me .: 148.57
<S> the aldermen of the city give a fe te on the third of october .: 57.68
<S> milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face , framed with black hair and whiskers , the only expression of which was icy impassibility .: 149.90
<S> the artful creature at once comprehended that she was <UNK> herself by allowing him thus to read her soul ; she collected her features , and in a complaining voice said : in the name of heaven , sir , tell me if it is to you , if it is to your government , if it is to an enemy i am to attribute the violence that is done me ? no violence will be offered to you , madame , and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in england . then you don t know me , sir ? it is the first time i have had the honor of seeing you . and on your honor , you have no cause of hatred against me ? none , i swear to you . there was so much serenity , coolness , mildness even , in the voice of the young man , that milady felt reassured .: 52.25
<S> marseilles the arrival chapter 2 .: 66.91
<S> you are going to kill the son , as you killed the mother !: 35.79
<S> yes , yes ! murmured d artagnan ; that s the place milady s own residence ! then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him , as well as all who loved him , and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court , since she had discovered all .: 85.15
<S> dante s took the lamp , placed it on a projecting stone above the bed , whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless , stiffened body .: 164.67
<S> oh , know him ?: 70.72
<S> the king motioned him to accompany them .: 33.04
<S> a man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column , and was reading with his back turned to the arcades , through the openings of which the new comers contemplated him .: 64.96
<S> what do you think of the story chalais s esquire relates ? asked another musketeer , without addressing anyone in particular , but on the contrary speaking to everybody .: 122.73
<S> there was a moment s silence , during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly , even in the midst of his conversation ; and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie , into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco , which seems to remove with its <UNK> all the troubles of the mind , and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul .: 138.62
<S> he drew back the bolt of his door , and almost directly an old lady entered , <UNK> , carrying her shawl on her arm , and her bonnet in her hand .: 66.88
<S> and so i did , replied caderousse ; though once , i confess , i envied him his good fortune .: 68.01
<S> no , hermine , replied debray ; you can not make me believe that ; on the contrary , you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count s .: 32.99
<S> at what age did you leave greece , signora ? asked he .: 57.99
<S> he was a fine , tall , slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty , with black eyes , and hair as dark as a <UNK> s wing ; and his whole appearance <UNK> that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger .: 167.61
<S> that is true , said d artagnan , let us call the others . they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis .: 21.38
<S> captivity : the third day chapter <UNK> .: 76.78
<S> ah , this time you can not lose ground , my fine friend ! exclaimed d artagnan .: 23.66
<S> stop , sir , look yonder , he whispered ; don t you see in the darkness something pass by , like shadows ?: 78.02
<S> but where is your master ? he is following me . the servitor opened the gate and walked before planchet , who made a sign to d artagnan .: 37.05
<S> say no more about it !: 49.71
<S> the journey had seemed very long to dante s , but monte cristo found it equally short .: 62.89
<S> will you believe the government of a <UNK> , a kingdom , and an empire ? albert cast his eyes on the passport , then raised them in astonishment to beauchamp .: 90.35
<S> at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them .: 50.35
<S> but , said the count , so great was ali pasha s confidence , that on his death bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care . albert started on hearing these words ; the history of hayde e recurred to him , and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring , and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave .: 68.56
<S> then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of forges ; they stopped on the road , but you continued yours .: 73.56
<S> you do not understand the points of english horses . the countenance of poor ali recovered its serenity .: 212.35
<S> he will not return till after the taking of the city . ah , you fancy so !: 46.37
<S> the count de rochefort ? grimaud nodded the third time .: 84.98
<S> i am taken ! shouted athos , with all the power of his lungs .: 46.21
<S> the man in the red cloak the despair of athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more <UNK> the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary man .: 169.37
<S> porthos ! he exclaimed .: 12.08
<S> noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most profound scrutiny .: 25.82
<S> his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of <UNK> himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door , on the lookout for guests who seldom came , yet there he stood , day after day , exposed to the <UNK> rays of a burning sun , with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it , after the manner of the spanish <UNK> .: 313.58
<S> what do you say to that ? i might answer , sire , that he is too deeply interested in the question to be a very impartial witness ; but so far from that , sire , i know the duke to be a royal gentleman , and i refer the matter to him but upon one condition , sire . what ? it is that your majesty will make him come here , will interrogate him yourself , te te a te te , without witnesses , and that i shall see your majesty as soon as you have seen the duke . what , then !: 62.08
<S> there are some situations which men understand by instinct , but which reason is powerless to explain ; in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow .: 233.17
<S> this celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity .: 316.29
<S> i am like nero <UNK> <UNK> ; and that is what is amusing you at this moment .: 137.68
<S> debray was not yet come , but albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera .: 79.01
<S> the usher introduced him , and retired without speaking a word .: 32.61
<S> did i not see you the other day smile on the duke of orleans ?: 59.89
<S> the postscript is explicit . i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting , you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation , said franz .: 83.03
<S> at first the king answered that he would not go ; but he could not resist his love of sport , and set out after dinner . and the king has seen the cardinal ? asked m. de tre ville .: 28.10
<S> the queen had them .: 41.66
<S> whither are you taking me ? asked he .: 24.17
<S> why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair ? he took care not to do so , monsieur ; on the contrary , he came up to me and said , it is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and not i , since he knows everything and i know nothing .: 39.06
<S> ample <UNK> of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above mentioned edmond dante s , who either carries the letter for paris about with him , or has it at his father s abode .: 241.61
<S> that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarron s pension . that is unreasonable , said athos , saluting in his turn the two cavaliers .: 150.35
<S> he dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade , whilst he and others , remaining on their horses , were to protect the assailants .: 112.70
<S> one ball struck the head of the already wounded guard , and the other flattened itself against a rock , after having passed within two inches of d artagnan .: 114.47
<S> d artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of st. leu , and followed him instinctively .: 77.88
<S> if i should disturb a rendezvous , that would not be the best means of commencing an acquaintance . meantime the young woman continued to advance , counting the houses and windows .: 99.88
<S> the heart breaks when , after having been elated by flattering hopes , it sees all its illusions destroyed .: 511.53
<S> he rose on the entrance of the coadjutor , and at that moment ten o clock struck .: 19.27
<S> why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed ? alas , it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated , that you talk of beginning over again .: 221.13
<S> the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week ; and seeing them , dante s sighed heavily .: 115.43
<S> sure enough !: 244.65
<S> i uttered a cry of joy ; the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child .: 46.67
<S> about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were , the roof had given way , leaving a large round opening , through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven , thickly studded with stars .: 113.57
<S> you left it to me to discover the means and i have done so . porthos looked at d artagnan with an expression of profound admiration .: 29.45
<S> two large slabs of marble , on which were inscribed their names , were placed on either side of a little enclosure , <UNK> in , and shaded by four <UNK> trees .: 174.69
<S> franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows .: 73.90
<S> go to sleep soon , louis , said the queen , for you must be awakened very early . i will do my best to obey you , madame , said the youthful king , but i have no inclination to sleep . laporte , said anne of austria , in an undertone , find some very dull book to read to his majesty , but do not undress yourself . the king went out , accompanied by the chevalier de coislin , bearing the candlestick , and then the queen returned to her own apartment .: 45.68
<S> i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother .: 86.99
<S> to danglars monte cristo also wrote , requesting him to excuse the <UNK> gift of a capricious millionaire , and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses .: 213.78
<S> this time caderousse endeavored to call again , but he could only utter a groan , and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds .: 62.31
<S> but where is louise ? asked the comte .: 41.97
<S> five hundred pounds . and where did you get so much money ? said athos .: 29.27
<S> we are mistaken , said d artagnan .: 7.04
<S> all the frame was adjusted except the head , which lay on the table .: 78.67
<S> well , sir , said de guiche , are you going to reply ? i am a priest , said the young man .: 9.27
<S> hatred is blind , rage carries you away ; and he who <UNK> out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught . yes , if he be poor and inexperienced , not if he be rich and skilful ; besides , the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken , and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel .: 192.84
<S> d artagnan was beside himself with joy .: 14.40
<S> hunting for the equipments the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly d artagnan , although he , in his quality of guardsman , would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers , who were all of high rank ; but our gascon cadet was , as may have been observed , of a provident and almost avaricious character , and with that explain the contradiction so vain as almost to rival porthos .: 212.93
<S> nobody knew a word of this enigma .: 86.54
<S> debray ? inquired danglars , with an air of indulgence and good nature that made monte cristo smile , acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker s domestic life .: 83.97
<S> but i thought , he said , that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any one i ?: 75.30
<S> should andrea marry according to his father s views , he will , perhaps , give him one , two , or three millions .: 83.60
<S> on the staircase he met the pretty soubrette , who brushed gently against him as she passed , and then , blushing to the eyes , asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted instantly .: 72.20
<S> then dante s rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks , took his gun in one hand , his pickaxe in the other , and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated .: 130.40
<S> we have nothing to fear from those who love us . you speak very suddenly of love , monsieur , said the young woman , shaking her head .: 26.76
<S> i am just setting out for blois .: 66.48
<S> upon my word !: 16.68
<S> i will even venture to say that i am certain m. de buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event .: 80.74
<S> he had wept all night long , but would not show his grief before the people .: 121.05
<S> oh , mademoiselle , mademoiselle ! cried franz , your grandfather says he can indicate the person .: 57.30
<S> say it then ; if i am in fault i will avow the error . the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence , whilst that of aramis , which had become harsh and <UNK> in his moments of ill humor , irritated him .: 137.64
<S> marry , forsooth , people don t die of hunger here . and aramis , drawing in the ladder , closed the window .: 91.49
<S> he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case ; it was the honor of m. de morcerf , and that of the whole house , he proposed to defend , by provoking a debate on personal questions , which are always such painful themes of discussion .: 119.97
<S> then , <UNK> all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice , he addressed the inspector , and sought to inspire him with pity .: 91.87
<S> welcome among us , your excellency , he said to him ; you heard what the count just said , and also my reply ; let me add that i would not for the four thousand piastres at which i had fixed your friend s ransom , that this had happened . but , said franz , looking round him uneasily , where is the viscount ? i do not see him . nothing has happened to him , i hope , said the count <UNK> .: 57.94
<S> row , porthos , row . and setting the example he <UNK> his oar into the sea ; two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms further .: 350.35
<S> it was something terrible to witness the silent agony , the mute despair of noirtier , whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks .: 81.70
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> he was nineteen when he entered the cha teau d if ; he was thirty three when he escaped .: 50.53
<S> according to the arrangements , the carriage was waiting at the door .: 22.60
<S> but you may use it , replied lord wilmore ; i understand it . and i , replied the visitor , changing his <UNK> , know enough of english to keep up the conversation .: 73.80
<S> you are the representative of justice here , and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect . who was your brother ? asked he .: 44.85
<S> maximilian sprang down the staircase , and threw his arms round his father s neck ; but suddenly he recoiled , and placed his right hand on morrel s breast .: 36.71
<S> you have guessed rightly .: 29.04
<S> the sailors looked at one another .: 19.07
<S> speak , if you please , said mazarin .: 10.61
<S> you ! he said , you !: 18.94
<S> we have made our calculations with spartan economy , and we each require fifteen hundred livres . four times fifteen makes sixty six thousand livres , said athos .: 153.07
<S> you have nothing more to ask of me , my lord ? said rochefort .: 15.34
<S> indeed , said julie , might we not almost fancy , emmanuel , that those people , so rich , so happy but yesterday , had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius like the wicked fairies in <UNK> s stories who present themselves <UNK> at a wedding or baptism hovered over them , and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect ? what a <UNK> misfortune ! said emmanuel , thinking of morcerf and danglars .: 273.57
<S> at that instant the little side gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened , and a tall , powerful young man appeared .: 111.62
<S> my words have not convinced you .: 91.27
<S> he was a picard , whom the glorious musketeer had picked up on the bridge <UNK> , making rings and <UNK> in the water .: 180.64
<S> the one i have hired for you . where will it take me ? where you please , after you have put me on shore at portsmouth . what are you going to do at portsmouth ? asked milady .: 44.80
<S> no , said morrel ; is someone dead in his house ? the general has just blown his brains out , replied monte cristo with great coolness .: 40.89
<S> but wait .: 61.26
<S> tomorrow i will come and announce to you the departure of my messenger . lord de winter rose , saluted her ironically , and went out .: 35.06
<S> at the sight of the little letter the heart of d artagnan bounded , for he believed he recognized the handwriting , and although he had seen that writing but once , the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart .: 40.75
<S> now , as i have never known any sinbad , with the exception of the one celebrated in the thousand and one nights well , it is one of his descendants , and a great friend of mine ; he is a very rich englishman , eccentric almost to insanity , and his real name is lord wilmore . ah , indeed ?: 61.76
<S> certainly , women alone know how to dissimulate , said monte cristo to himself , glancing at madame danglars , who was smiling on the procureur , and embracing his wife .: 50.67
<S> for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself . franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day , for many reasons .: 115.38
<S> aramis reflected for a minute , and then said , coloring , will it be really rendering you a service , d artagnan ? i shall be grateful to you all my life . very well .: 44.66
<S> selim was still at his post , and smiled sadly on us as we entered .: 77.98
<S> if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase project gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work , you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.e.1 through 1.e.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the project gutenberg trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.e.8 or 1.e.9 .: 14.92
<S> it was to this effect : tears , entreaties , prayers , have availed me nothing .: 230.86
<S> have we relations with the court ?: 57.45
<S> but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste ; i must go to paris . ah , really ? to paris !: 59.54
<S> more than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service .: 310.96
<S> if not , why , there would be no promotion ; and since you assure me that the cargo is all safe and sound , m. morrel , take my word for it ; and i advise you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage . then , as they were just passing the round tower , the young man shouted : stand by there to lower the topsails and jib ; <UNK> up the <UNK> ! the order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man of war .: 98.56
<S> is he at liberty ? asked the queen .: 10.51
<S> he brought me up as if i had been his son , and in 1814 he married .: 29.67
<S> nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear ; but when poor , silly folks , like my husband there , have been persuaded to tell all they know , the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten ; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it , behold trouble and misery , and all sorts of persecutions , are heaped on the unfortunate wretches , who can not even see whence all their afflictions come . nay , nay , my good woman , make yourself perfectly easy , i beg of you .: 170.62
<S> ah , really this is magnificent !: 38.37
<S> on the contrary , i gave you to understand , i think , that i adhered to the princes .: 28.53
<S> this time i did not content myself with looking , but i took my knife out of my pocket , felt that the point was sharp , and sprang over the wall .: 37.85
<S> no , nothing at all .: 17.34
<S> the magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles ; its <UNK> awoke him , and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in blood .: 161.75
<S> his house has been full ever since .: 134.96
<S> all he possessed was <UNK> francs .: 587.14
<S> seek them , my lord , and find them , i conjure you . i will search for them , madame , said de winter and doubtless i shall find them ; but time fails me .: 47.37
<S> anne it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men ; but aramis , after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos , begged his friends not to revert to the subject again , declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it , he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs .: 150.78
<S> madame de <UNK> has hastened to him with broth ; la <UNK> warms his sheets ; the marquise de rambouillet sends him his <UNK> . you don t like him , my dear <UNK> , said scarron .: 316.92
<S> athos not only failed to reply , he even changed the subject of conversation .: 77.86
<S> it is natural enough ; this strange chain of domestic afflictions , followed by the no less strange death of his daughter strange ?: 297.35
<S> well , if you will have the truth , and me , too ! said athos .: 18.90
<S> the examination chapter 8 .: 73.02
<S> my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon , examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake , while my mother , reclining by his side , rested her head on his shoulder , and i played at his feet , admiring everything i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves , but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance .: 205.08
<S> madame , said the president , may reference be made to the count of monte cristo , who is now , i believe , in paris ? sir , replied hayde e , the count of monte cristo , my foster father , has been in normandy the last three days . who , then , has <UNK> you to take this step , one for which the court is deeply indebted to you , and which is perfectly natural , considering your birth and your misfortunes ? sir , replied hayde e , i have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief .: 45.16
<S> do ; but make no treaty you understand me ? you need not fear . morrel advanced towards beauchamp and cha teau renaud , who , seeing his intention , came to meet him .: 63.23
<S> you know , athos , you never spoke much of such matters . ah , mon dieu , yes , you are right , athos replied ; but then there must be some occasion for speaking . porthos wouldn t have waited for it so patiently , said d artagnan , with a smile .: 35.99
<S> valentine summoned every effort , and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep .: 617.67
<S> but you were just speaking on a very interesting topic , beauchamp . i ? yes ; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of valentine . ah , yes , so i was .: 60.92
<S> these gentlemen <UNK> war on private account , and in buying them up , by granting them what they wished , monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain .: 161.94
<S> nevertheless , even in my present state of <UNK> , i protest that i feel happy .: 113.14
<S> who s up there ? said the man .: 35.29
<S> are you on the ground ? asked d artagnan .: 7.64
<S> and whose horses are these ? cried d artagnan .: 36.90
<S> never mind that foolish girl , villefort , said the marquise .: 33.03
<S> the prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes , prayer , and despondency .: 179.23
<S> no , said caderousse , we are not rich enough to lose 5,000 francs . as you please , my dear sir , said the jeweller ; i had , however , as you see , brought you the money in bright coin . and he drew from his pocket a handful of gold , and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper , and in the other hand he held a packet of bank notes .: 25.84
<S> he questioned me concerning captain leclere s death ; and , as the latter had told me , gave me a letter to carry on to a person in paris .: 54.51
<S> this way ! constance ?: 307.05
<S> he had again missed his man , who had disappeared as if by enchantment .: 43.62
<S> tell her grace , replied athos , that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the hotel de luynes . then , with renewed instructions to grimaud , athos signified to raoul that he could set out , and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that raoul should be away from paris at that moment .: 68.14
<S> depend upon it , i know what i say .: 26.76
<S> oh , those figures , how well i remember them !: 68.71
<S> her mistress put on a charming face , and smiled on her graciously ; but alas !: 107.33
<S> i was looking anxiously for some iris roots i planted here , close to this <UNK> , and which some one has trampled upon this morning .: 259.44
<S> what troubles me is the idea of defeat .: 180.24
<S> he fancied , also , that in going he had already observed the street <UNK> who had attracted his attention .: 122.78
<S> he darted a preparatory glance at athos and aramis , who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for action .: 167.25
<S> both went into the bedroom , and as the door of communication remained open , d artagnan could hear milady for some time <UNK> her maid .: 82.47
<S> there , monsieur , there is that letter ! cried the queen , with a broken and trembling voice ; take it , and deliver me from your odious presence . the chancellor , who , on his part , trembled with an emotion easily to be conceived , took the letter , bowed to the ground , and retired .: 41.57
<S> don t trouble yourself to reveal your good luck ; no one asks for your secret all the world knows your discretion .: 182.58
<S> the sight of this creature , who had nothing of the woman about her , recalled awful remembrances .: 100.49
<S> i will bless you i i am dying ! cried mordaunt , come to me !: 35.79
<S> some were perusing the article , others making comments and recalling circumstances which <UNK> the charges still more .: 1247.85
<S> i once bore another , which you knew , but you have certainly forgotten it . tell it me , sir . formerly , said the count , i was athos . madame de chevreuse looked astonished .: 68.74
<S> in a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that might have rested on their spirits .: 186.69
<S> then all the members looked at each other with terror .: 26.33
<S> do you know that i am growing old ?: 21.94
<S> and provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as mine , they will require no more of you ; nay , perhaps you will even have a double reward . i , madame , i ? cried felton .: 85.61
<S> and do you believe he knew you again , kitty ? i pulled down my hood as soon as i saw him , but perhaps it was too late . go down , athos he <UNK> you less than me and see if he be still at his door . athos went down and returned immediately .: 53.67
<S> well , then , said milady , i confide in my brother ; i will dare to at this moment the steps of lord de winter were heard ; but this time the terrible brother in law of milady did not content himself , as on the preceding day , with passing before the door and going away again .: 44.48
<S> i believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour .: 110.19
<S> preceded by ali , who carried a rose colored flambeau in his hand , the young lady , who was no other than the lovely greek who had been monte cristo s companion in italy , was conducted to her apartments , while the count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself .: 63.71
<S> but , replied felton , i wish to know . do not question me , said the prisoner ; you know that we who are true christians are forbidden to lie . well , then , said felton , i will tell you what you were doing , or rather what you meant to do ; you were going to complete the fatal project you cherish in your mind .: 40.74
<S> the <UNK> was already lowered , and in it were four oarsmen and a <UNK> .: 182.74
<S> the door at last opened ; albert de morcerf entered first , and i began to hope my fears were vain , when , after him , another young man advanced , and the count exclaimed : ah , here is the baron franz d e pinay ! i summoned all my strength and courage to my support .: 64.41
<S> various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast ; but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended .: 262.09
<S> you have told your coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo , to drive round the walls , and re enter by the porta san giovanni ? these are my words exactly . well , this route is impossible . impossible ! very dangerous , to say the least . dangerous ! and why ? on account of the famous luigi vampa . pray , who may this famous luigi vampa be ? inquired albert ; he may be very famous at rome , but i can assure you he is quite unknown at paris . what !: 67.10
<S> for the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman .: 42.96
<S> the slightest rustling of the foliage , the least whistling of the wind , attracted his attention , and drew the perspiration to his brow ; then he tremblingly fixed his ladder , and , not to lose a moment , placed his foot on the first step .: 64.11
<S> the youths spurred on .: 127.27
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> and then , resumed d artagnan , to this <UNK> is probably added poverty , for he must have neglected the little that he had , and the dirty scoundrel , grimaud , more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master stay , planchet , it breaks my heart to merely think of it . i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him <UNK> , said planchet , in a piteous tone , but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things , for i imagine that those lofty walls , now turning ruby in the setting sun , are the walls of blois . probably ; and those <UNK> , pointed and sculptured , that we catch a glimpse of yonder , are similar to those that i have heard described at <UNK> . at this moment one of those heavy <UNK> , drawn by <UNK> , which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire , came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following .: 181.91
<S> my mother experienced the same sensations , for i felt her tremble .: 74.01
<S> she thought that lord de winter had hastened her departure ; she thought she was condemned to set off that very evening .: 36.17
<S> he is dead , and no mistake about it . oh , yes ; and they may have the fact attested whenever they please . so be it , said the englishman .: 60.37
<S> but monte cristo , without rising , and leaning forward in his chair , merely stretched out his arm and , taking the damp , crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man : sir , said he in a solemn tone , i consider your glove thrown , and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet .: 83.37
<S> my father , said hayde e , raising her head , was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini , pasha of yanina , and before whom turkey trembled . albert , without knowing why , started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent ; it appeared to him as if there was something <UNK> gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of hayde e at this moment ; she appeared like a <UNK> <UNK> a spectre , as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man , to the news of which all europe had listened with horror .: 98.99
<S> it is men whom i should hold responsible , and i will hold them responsible . be seated , juxon , said the king , falling upon his knees .: 55.38
<S> are you going to drown me ? these cries had something so heartrending in them that m. d artagnan , who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of milady , sat down on the stump of a tree and hung his head , covering his ears with the <UNK> of his hands ; and yet , notwithstanding , he could still hear her cry and threaten .: 67.52
<S> i think i have killed the insolent fellow .: 44.54
<S> he resolved , therefore , to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count .: 79.01
<S> well , continued valentine , the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful marriage , which drives me to despair . noirtier s breathing came thick and short .: 116.20
<S> on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin .: 475.04
<S> well , then , read this paper , which i have never shown to anyone . tomorrow , my dear friend , said edmond , desirous of not yielding to the old man s madness .: 37.31
<S> only their wish to see each other had become a necessity , and they would have preferred death to a day s separation .: 77.54
<S> and that you should fail me ! d artagnan passed a very bad night .: 51.61
<S> moreover , d artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her ; and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character .: 104.83
<S> but his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion .: 106.27
<S> very well , cried i , then the place of my punishment will be that of my tomb .: 38.73
<S> the same day the young man set forward on his journey , furnished with the three paternal gifts , which consisted , as we have said , of fifteen crowns , the horse , and the letter for m. de tre ville the counsels being thrown into the bargain .: 69.17
<S> i only say they cost a load of money to hang , and what is the use of them , i should like to know ? there used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night , but it has been taken to the house at auteuil , to that you went to , you know . yes . i was saying to him only yesterday , you are imprudent , monsieur count ; for when you go to auteuil and take your servants the house is left unprotected . well , said he , what next ? well , next , some day you will be robbed . what did he answer ? he quietly said , what do i care if i am ? andrea , he has some secretaire with a spring . how do you know ? yes , which <UNK> the thief in a trap and plays a tune .: 75.19
<S> patrick soon caught the sound of his master s voice calling his <UNK> .: 155.73
<S> arrived at the barracks he made himself known , took the best horse in the stables , mounted and gained the high road .: 100.79
<S> thank god !: 25.88
<S> a physician , a physician , m .: 41.32
<S> i spoke to benedetto alone , and proposed to him to accompany me , endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve .: 97.62
<S> which means , resumed aramis , that he might perfectly understand , the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders , when they bestow the benediction . an admirable subject ! cried the jesuit .: 148.48
<S> the corsican ogre at the sight of this agitation louis xviii .: 52.27
<S> i was not aware that you were so intimate with her . who told you we were intimate , maximilian ? no one , but you appeared to be so .: 38.70
<S> as for winter , at the sound of that voice he turned pale , and was , as it were , petrified .: 31.82
<S> do you keep a journal ? no , my life has been passed in <UNK> ; i wish to forget it myself . do you talk in your sleep ? <UNK> i sleep soundly , like a child ; do you not remember ? the color mounted to the baroness s face , and villefort turned awfully pale .: 74.63
<S> nonsense , said d artagnan ; you would do as much , mr .: 41.61
<S> read the letters and see if i have lied or spoken the truth . but mazarin , notwithstanding this permission , instead of reading the letters , took the knife which the dying buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by laporte to the queen .: 114.17
<S> sit down , morrel , and wait . morrel obeyed ; the count arose , and <UNK> a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain , took from it a little silver casket , beautifully carved and chased , the corners of which represented four bending figures , similar to the <UNK> , the forms of women , <UNK> of the angels <UNK> to heaven .: 173.97
<S> thence he saw the king , the queen and monsieur mazarin , and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty .: 36.43
<S> he wrote the same day for the required information to m. de boville , who , from having been an inspector of prisons , was promoted to a high office in the police ; and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars .: 99.53
<S> you know the history of the saraband ? pardieu ! know it ! replied d artagnan , who knew nothing about it , but who wished to appear to know everything that was going on .: 28.20
<S> were i but a frenchman !: 169.78
<S> it is a false diamond , said caderousse .: 18.02
<S> the soldiers were playing or sleeping ; two of them were singing in a corner , out of tune , the psalm : on the rivers of babylon . d artagnan called the sergeant .: 101.70
<S> and will it be the first time you have ever been there , dante s ? yes . have you business there ? not of my own ; the last commission of poor captain leclere ; you know to what i allude , danglars it is sacred .: 58.83
<S> betrayed !: 263.82
<S> you must have had enough for today .: 88.81
<S> to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived <UNK> of him , that he had his own horses and carriages , and that not having come together , it would not be difficult for them to leave separately .: 120.83
<S> oh ! he cried , athos !: 12.23
<S> then we shall pay the more , that s all , i see plainly enough .: 40.45
<S> albert bathed , took his supper , and went to bed .: 48.43
<S> in addition to this , everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection .: 332.83
<S> he rejoined this woman ; they fled together into berry , and there he obtained a little curacy .: 260.13
<S> then i launched out into the path that was opened to me .: 43.18
<S> well , said the baron , on leaving her you will not escape tonight ! at ten o clock felton came and placed the sentinel .: 40.34
<S> our four friends , in particular , astonished their comrades ; they traveled together , side by side , with sad eyes and heads lowered .: 142.09
<S> a few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads .: 31.45
<S> athos , who still suffered grievously from his wound , though it had been dressed anew by m. de tre ville s surgeon , was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand , his feather even touching the ground .: 95.07
<S> i still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight , sword in hand . yes , said d artagnan ; but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose ? oh ! said porthos , you can t think that , d artagnan ! d artagnan did not believe athos to be capable of a deception , but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous .: 60.63
<S> one of them lifted the plank , took out a flask of wine , drank some , and then passed it to his companion .: 38.93
<S> the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news .: 23.81
<S> i know she was loaded with cotton , and that she took in her freight at alexandria from <UNK> s warehouse , and at smyrna from pascal s ; that is all i was obliged to know , and i beg i may not be asked for any further particulars . now i recollect , said the afflicted old father ; my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee , and another of tobacco for me ! there , you see , exclaimed danglars .: 122.18
<S> now four days had elapsed , and valentine still lived .: 67.10
<S> ah , said he , dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness , do not talk of such things , and suffer love pains ?: 112.15
<S> my safety is now a mere question of speed . at this moment he saw a cab at the top of the faubourg <UNK> re .: 62.35
<S> this child was the only heir to lord de winter , if lord de winter did not marry .: 31.51
<S> the interior of the musketeers chapter <UNK> .: 39.31
<S> he inquired where they were , and was answered by a burst of laughter .: 25.95
<S> she was sent by her mistress to the false de wardes .: 58.65
<S> and then , said monte cristo , this is not all . what is there more ? said debray , who had not failed to notice the agitation of madame danglars .: 18.85
<S> however , i had better find him out first , since he can t want money .: 79.22
<S> i know nothing about it . you don t know i quit the seminary ? not at all . this is my story , then .: 29.32
<S> poor king charles !: 97.98
<S> if there was a beautiful <UNK> , or a sweet rose , you had to search for it , concealed in some corner behind a mother with a <UNK> , or an aunt with a bird of paradise .: 148.78
<S> anne , trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation , left the room , shutting the door violently after her .: 128.08
<S> meanwhile the heat became excessive .: 239.17
<S> planchet was more courageous , it must be admitted , by day than by night .: 113.26
<S> merce de s and albert were in that room .: 25.92
<S> for two reasons . what ones ? the first is that my mistress will never love you . how do you know that ? you have cut her to the heart . i ?: 51.95
<S> on this paved yard are to be seen , pacing to and fro from morning till night , pale , careworn , and haggard , like so many shadows , the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is <UNK> .: 187.64
<S> i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses .: 37.64
<S> besides , he had long known the prince , whilst raoul now saw him for the first time .: 40.56
<S> to the seine with the officer ! were heard above all the noise , deafening as it was .: 132.12
<S> the duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch , three cavaliers with two riding horses .: 56.38
<S> in person , and fortunately it seems for you , my young friend .: 35.38
<S> i mentioned your diamond then to my adversary , who had likewise remarked it .: 123.74
<S> the officers , table and that of the king were opposite to them .: 70.08
<S> let us try not to jest , if we can .: 44.32
<S> he reached the hedge and hid himself behind it ; in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place , he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone .: 56.81
<S> she is perhaps a prisoner ; she is perhaps dead ! yes , but you have at least this consolation , that you can say to yourself she has not quit you voluntarily , that if you learn no news of her , it is because all communication with you is interdicted ; while i well ? nothing , replied aramis , nothing . so you renounce the world , then , forever ; that is a settled thing a resolution registered ! forever !: 108.90
<S> yes , the queen !: 14.16
<S> milady remained alone , with her eyes fixed upon the door .: 17.73
<S> you see , edmond , i am not mistaken , and have cause to say , spare my son ! and who told you , madame , that i have any hostile intentions against your son ? no one , in truth ; but a mother has twofold sight .: 52.39
<S> you have a friend , monsieur du vallon , whom i like much ; let him accompany you . the devil ! said d artagnan to himself .: 13.11
<S> franz let him proceed without interruption , and , in fact , did not hear what was said ; he longed to be alone , and free to ponder over all that had occurred .: 56.96
<S> motives of hatred against dante s ?: 205.40
<S> now , d herblay , said athos , dismount and come here . aramis dismounted and went to porthos , whilst athos approached d artagnan .: 43.45
<S> you are the only man of whom i have heard her speak with interest . albert rose and took his hat ; the count conducted him to the door .: 31.78
<S> this portion of the napkin was marked with half a baron s crown , and the letter <UNK> truly , truly , said madame danglars , all my linen is marked thus ; monsieur de nargonne was a baron , and my name is hermine .: 139.67
<S> yes , yes , i see him well enough , said d artagnan .: 11.70
<S> silence , then ! cried athos .: 16.86
<S> bonacieux , and a convent was not impregnable .: 49.81
<S> di <UNK> , said one of the men , descending a little path leading out of the appian way .: 177.87
<S> but dress yourself ; see , m. de morcerf sets you the example . albert was drawing on the satin <UNK> over his black trousers and varnished boots .: 231.18
<S> onward ! cried porthos .: 15.98
<S> is she french ? no ; a venetian . and her name is countess g . ah , i know her by name ! exclaimed albert ; she is said to possess as much wit and <UNK> as beauty .: 91.01
<S> personally , i do not know you . this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was , for the moment , restrained by a more muscular hand than his own , and that the restraint could not be easily broken through .: 97.26
<S> and why not ? asked the young man .: 7.52
<S> no , he cried , they have not wounded , but perhaps they have robbed me ! and he thrust his hands into his pockets .: 42.63
<S> taste that fowl and those fish .: 390.12
<S> and why is it impossible ? because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends , or rather , i am one of his .: 22.11
<S> dear lady , said mme .: 38.01
<S> look at it , aramis . the roll call finished , the president ordered them to read the act of accusation .: 98.43
<S> pooh !: 27.43
<S> i will ask leave of absence of monsieur de tre ville , on some pretext or other which you must invent ; i am not very clever at pretexts .: 70.65
<S> if you are outside the united states , check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading , copying , displaying , performing , distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg work .: 14.66
<S> the two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and grand daughter of henry iv. , the wife and daughter of charles i .: 193.86
<S> she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him .: 104.27
<S> in the course of the forenoon monsieur de beaufort had a game of tennis with la ramee ; a sign from grimaud put him on the alert .: 61.36
<S> before god and before men , said he , i accuse this woman of having poisoned constance bonacieux , who died yesterday evening . he turned towards porthos and aramis .: 97.86
<S> he was the friend of the king , who honored highly , as everyone knows , the memory of his father , henry iv .: 43.03
<S> three of my best soldiers , whom your majesty knows by name , and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated , and who have , i dare affirm to the king , his service much at heart three of my best soldiers , i say , athos , porthos , and aramis , had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony , whom i had introduced to them the same morning .: 77.32
<S> well , my dear friend , let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron bar . porthos went to the window , took a bar in his hands , clung to it and bent it like a bow ; so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been fixed .: 63.86
<S> february 5th , 1815 ! said he ; it is the day my father was murdered . valentine and villefort were dumb ; the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly , go on . but it was on leaving this club , said he , my father disappeared . noirtier s eye continued to say , read . he resumed : the <UNK> louis jacques beaurepaire , lieutenant colonel of artillery , e tienne duchampy , general of brigade , and <UNK> lecharpal , keeper of woods and forests , declare , that on the 4th of february , a letter arrived from the island of elba , recommending to the kindness and the confidence of the bonapartist club , general <UNK> de quesnel , who having served the emperor from <UNK> to 1814 was supposed to be devoted to the interests of the napoleon <UNK> , notwithstanding the title of baron which louis xviii .: 163.36
<S> i do not know the young man ; he is said to be of good family and rich , but i never trust to vague assertions .: 50.60
<S> the curates asked him what was to be done .: 40.54
<S> d artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself , and drawing the commission from his pocket , said , here , my dear athos , this naturally belongs to you . athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles .: 30.29
<S> let us wait , by all means .: 29.93
<S> he knew her well enough in all cases to know that , whether acting for or against him , as a friend or an enemy , she would not remain motionless without great impediments ; but whence did these impediments arise ?: 194.89
<S> yes , continued the queen , i think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince , and i wish to know your name . yes , thought planchet , to treat me as a prince .: 33.65
<S> assassins !: 184.78
<S> that s a match you are playing with his eminence ; this letter is your game .: 78.28
<S> i can only say how sincerely i ask pardon for having grieved you .: 70.73
<S> they would be glad to see me dead , but they would not like themselves to die with me . my mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my father s heart .: 64.10
<S> i could interpret one of your looks . then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown ? instantly ! but on my part , said milady , how should i repay such a service ?: 110.61
<S> impossible ! go on , go on , my dear fellow ! said d artagnan ; for upon my honor , you will kill me with your indifference . we divided , then , this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles each . you are laughing at me , and want to try me ! said d artagnan , whom anger began to take by the hair , as <UNK> takes achilles , in the <UNK> .: 62.90
<S> in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers .: 42.09
<S> hallo , fernand !: 110.66
<S> she is very amiable , then , is she not ? said albert .: 21.35
<S> don t alarm yourself , my little benedetto , but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance , and i will contrive it . well , i ll see i ll try to contrive some way , said andrea .: 76.93
<S> you shall place it on that table , and you may remain between it and me . felton offered the weapon to milady , who examined the temper of it attentively , and who tried the point on the tip of her finger .: 72.88
<S> he assembled his keepers , and notwithstanding his well known difficulty of utterance , addressed them as follows : gentlemen !: 194.33
<S> don t let it out at the hotel rambouillet ; it would ruin me , replied the abbe .: 35.64
<S> the host , on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra horses , advanced respectfully to the door .: 57.33
<S> the journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever commanded .: 163.03
<S> ten minutes afterward she was at home .: 22.24
<S> is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others , sir ?: 74.21
<S> in the chamber of d artagnan and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged .: 38.42
<S> athos invited d artagnan to follow them ; and although ignorant of the game , which he had never played , he accepted , not knowing what to do with his time from nine o clock in the morning , as it then scarcely was , till twelve .: 56.41
<S> this door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard , ready to obey the orders of the prince de conti s lieutenant .: 46.81
<S> if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse <UNK> , we should not expose it thus to view .: 196.43
<S> but that is not all , madame .: 14.45
<S> oh , yes , said buckingham , grating his teeth with rage .: 39.50
<S> one moment i beg for here are the chevalier d herblay and the comte de la fere , just arrived from london , and they can give you , as eye witnesses , such details as you can convey to the queen , my royal sister .: 75.78
<S> this was the departure of fernand of fernand , whose crime she did not know , and whom she regarded as her brother .: 59.13
<S> without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them , he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance .: 71.50
<S> i also intend from this time to work on my own account .: 54.49
<S> the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes , and then took a survey of the apartment , but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room .: 42.80
<S> you see , said raoul , we have done wisely . what a horrible face that monk has , said de guiche .: 83.52
<S> at that time it was believed that the separation of the musketeers and the guards would be but momentary , the king holding his parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day after .: 83.40
<S> the thought was maddening , and dante s threw himself furiously down on his straw .: 62.29
<S> i was concealed by a column , and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place .: 41.42
<S> the count withdrew his foot .: 24.41
<S> forsooth , i don t know . half a pistole if you can find out , said d artagnan .: 30.83
<S> here i am , ready to give you any explanation you desire . why , said danglars , in the letter i believe i have it about me here he felt in his breast pocket yes , here it is .: 57.21
<S> the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue , and the flame , brightening before it expired , threw out the last <UNK> which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies .: 215.77
<S> ask d artagnan . to london , gentlemen , said d artagnan .: 16.39
<S> but how do you know all this ? how do i know it ? yes , how do you know it ?: 11.97
<S> i , cried bonacieux , i deceive your eminence ! your wife , in going to rue de vaugirard and rue de la harpe , did not go to find linen <UNK> . then why did she go , just god ? she went to meet the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham . yes , cried bonacieux , recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances , yes , that s it .: 71.20
<S> she screamed aloud ; then running to the door exclaimed : help , help ! <UNK> what is the matter ? asked m. d avrigny , at the foot of the stairs , it being the hour he usually visited her .: 60.40
<S> i only ask you a simple question ; answer it ; that is all i require . i love a young girl , count . do you love her much ? more than my life . another hope defeated ! said the count .: 48.03
<S> he is my master , and i am his slave ; he has the right to notice nothing . the count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost recesses of his heart ; his eyes met those of the young girl and he could not bear their brilliancy .: 39.69
<S> fight , my dear captain , fight .: 102.53
<S> the will chapter 60 .: 57.57
<S> euge nie closed her eyes ; but though she could not see , she could hear , and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage .: 40.88
<S> for that night , madame , that night you loved me , i will swear it . my lord , yes ; it is possible that the influence of the place , the charm of the beautiful evening , the fascination of your look the thousand circumstances , in short , which sometimes unite to destroy a woman were grouped around me on that fatal evening ; but , my lord , you saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered .: 86.74
<S> besides , they felt that the de nouement of this second <UNK> was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make .: 90.78
<S> the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the argentina theatre , and were told they were all let .: 61.96
<S> before god and before men , i accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the baron de wardes ; but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation , i attest it myself .: 89.65
<S> three is just my number ! now , then , who are you ? asked the englishman .: 39.03
<S> monsieur du vallon and myself came from france with him . it appears , too , you kept him waiting a long time at boulogne . what would you have ?: 49.39
<S> with opium , <UNK> , brucea , snake wood , and the cherry laurel , they put to sleep all who stand in their way .: 280.87
<S> franz and the count advanced , and the bandit saluted them .: 44.24
<S> remember that . olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket .: 97.93
<S> the visitor was about fifty two years of age , dressed in one of the green <UNK> , ornamented with black <UNK> , which have so long maintained their popularity all over europe .: 148.05
<S> do you bring me tidings of my guardian ? have you not received any ? said d artagnan to the youth .: 35.85
<S> she extended her hands to him with a smile .: 15.92
<S> debray did not defend himself very warmly , for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind ; still , when he recollected the independent , proud spirit of euge nie , he positively rejected it as utterly impossible , though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart .: 170.97
<S> sometimes he was delirious , and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet ; he , also , was dying of hunger .: 69.84
<S> but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height , dressed in black , apparently of a certain age , for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features .: 96.64
<S> can all this force be summoned on my account ? thought he .: 61.43
<S> from the appearance of the stone , he continued , a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years .: 89.94
<S> that mood lasted some time ; but now he s as gentle as a lamb and sings gascon songs , which make one die of laughing . and du vallon ? asked athos .: 239.99
<S> well , never mind how it is , answered albert , it comes to the same thing in the end .: 33.95
<S> you are right welcome .: 49.39
<S> your interview will be private .: 116.07
<S> what do you want , monsieur ? demanded the musketeer , <UNK> a step , and with a foreign accent , which proved to d artagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures .: 26.97
<S> if you have been culpable , it was imprudence , and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your captain .: 66.77
<S> in short , she studied everything , as a skillful <UNK> does to whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not accustomed .: 138.47
<S> on guard , then ! cried athos .: 20.11
<S> thus i shall rejoice when mademoiselle euge nie perceives i am but a <UNK> atom , with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions . monte cristo smiled .: 222.87
<S> on his side , however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview , the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it .: 86.00
<S> and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal .: 68.94
<S> she soon whispered to her husband : i think it would be better for me to retire , with your permission , for the sight of me appears still to <UNK> your mother in law . madame de saint me ran heard her .: 49.95
<S> you have not played for a long time , i said ; you ought , then , to have a good hand . well , what then ? well ; the englishman and his companion are still here .: 31.03
<S> it only remains for me to know whether i also suit you ? oh , your excellency ! exclaimed baptistin eagerly .: 52.61
<S> is this carriage for us ? asked milady .: 19.29
<S> for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind , and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him .: 123.81
<S> the young girl rose instantly , but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death .: 73.35
<S> the deputy procureur was , therefore , the first magistrate of marseilles , when one morning his door opened , and m. morrel was announced .: 40.75
<S> oh ! cried mme .: 11.36
<S> nothing is concealed from the cardinal ; the cardinal knows everything . in that case , monseigneur , do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife ? perhaps he may ; but you must , in the first place , reveal to the cardinal all you know of your wife s relations with madame de chevreuse . but , monseigneur , i know nothing about them ; i have never seen her . when you went to fetch your wife from the louvre , did you always return directly home ? scarcely ever ; she had business to transact with linen <UNK> , to whose houses i conducted her . and how many were there of these linen <UNK> ? two , monseigneur . and where did they live ? one in rue de vaugirard , the other rue de la harpe . did you go into these houses with her ? never , monseigneur ; i waited at the door . and what excuse did she give you for entering all alone ? she gave me none ; she told me to wait , and i waited . you are a very complacent husband , my dear monsieur bonacieux , said the cardinal .: 63.27
<S> pardieu !: 27.02
<S> and he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party , whose money he managed .: 44.08
<S> but the revolution of july was , it seems , sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful , and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period .: 120.85
<S> a leather pocketbook , a purse , in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received , with a dice box and dice , completed the possessions of the dead man .: 116.22
<S> at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down .: 56.21
<S> i became angry ; he began to laugh , i threatened to strike him , and he made two steps backwards .: 83.68
<S> sir monk , said de guiche , confess well that brave man ; and be not concerned for your expenses or for those of your mule ; all is paid . thanks , monsieur , said the monk , with one of those smiles that made bragelonne shudder .: 110.03
<S> false gentleman ! cried d artagnan , springing forward , in his turn , after the servant .: 31.20
<S> the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud .: 108.80
<S> anne of austria received the blow with a beating heart .: 36.84
<S> four other noblemen awaited me .: 213.16
<S> well , my dear sir , said danglars to fernand , here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy . it drives me to despair , said fernand .: 38.49
<S> what could be the good of that ?: 24.41
<S> you must stop at the little village of eccuis , in which there is but one tavern the shield of france .: 90.49
<S> the three young men bowed to each other courteously , if not <UNK> .: 65.95
<S> i took a wax candle in one hand , and with the other groped about for a piece of paper my match box being empty , with which i proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the <UNK> .: 173.93
<S> trial chapter <UNK> .: 259.34
<S> come , gentlemen , let us all propose some place .: 54.30
<S> still , continued the procureur , looking at the doctor with uneasiness , if you wish it if you demand it , why then it shall be done .: 34.63
<S> come in , come in , said morrel , for i presume you are all at the door . scarcely had he uttered those words when madame morrel entered weeping bitterly .: 55.06
<S> the duke glanced at the clock .: 20.23
<S> you may , madame , said he , with emphasis .: 28.55
<S> d artagnan answered , with the greatest simplicity : i came to paris with exactly such intentions .: 53.24
<S> only <UNK> a little , replied d artagnan ; my fingers were caught between two stones that of the wall and that of my ring and the skin was broken . that comes of wearing diamonds , my master , said athos , disdainfully .: 94.21
<S> the man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other .: 71.34
<S> because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin ; because , going hence as emissaries to cromwell , we became partisans of king charles ; because , instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin , cromwell , <UNK> , bridge , fairfax , etc. , we very nearly succeeded in saving it . upon my word that is true , said porthos ; but how can you suppose , my dear friend , that in the midst of his great <UNK> general cromwell has had time to think cromwell thinks of everything ; cromwell has time for everything ; and believe me , dear friend , we ought not to lose our time it is precious .: 146.46
<S> now , here , <UNK> , we will do better than that let each take a half . of the handkerchief ? yes . perfectly just , cried the other two guardsmen , the judgment of king solomon !: 141.28
<S> you see , merce de s , said the young man , here is <UNK> come round again ; tell me , is this the moment for a wedding ? i have answered you a hundred times , fernand , and really you must be very stupid to ask me again . well , repeat it , repeat it , i beg of you , that i may at last believe it !: 42.31
<S> d artagnan hits on a plan .: 49.94
<S> i had provided myself with a dark lantern .: 93.90
<S> do you know modern greek , asked he .: 104.03
<S> but in vain did he rack his imagination ; fertile as it was , he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship .: 144.00
<S> as for myself , as soon as i recovered my senses i went to monsieur the governor , to whom i related all that had passed , and asked , what i should do with my prisoner .: 39.33
<S> two inches an hour does not seem much , but in twelve hours that makes two feet , and three we had before , that makes five .: 131.87
<S> you love me , madame ; it is enough . i love you , i ? yes , yes .: 17.47
<S> the prince procured for marie michon the dress of a cavalier and for kitty that of a lackey ; he sent them two excellent horses , and the fugitives went out hastily from tours , <UNK> their course toward spain , trembling at the least noise , following <UNK> roads , and asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn . why , really , it was all exactly as you say ! cried madame de chevreuse , clapping her hands .: 135.98
<S> hurry up there , you rascal ; we are mad with hunger and thirst ! bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand .: 109.87
<S> now shall i tell you something ? added athos , coolly .: 36.71
<S> give these happy tidings to your sister , my dear cousin .: 62.81
<S> i stretched out my arms .: 27.89
<S> franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count s pallor , which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting .: 70.74
<S> this league was directed against france .: 137.84
<S> three ! and at the same instant dante s felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird , falling , falling , with a rapidity that made his blood <UNK> .: 102.94
<S> in fact , the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied , the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil .: 329.01
<S> that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius . well , then , signor <UNK> , replied the singular amphitryon , you heard our repast announced , will you now take the trouble to enter the dining room , your humble servant going first to show the way ? at these words , moving aside the tapestry , sinbad preceded his guest .: 129.68
<S> sir , what a cook must monsieur pierrefonds have , when he was so fond of eating and drinking , even whilst he was only called monsieur porthos ! say no more ! cried d artagnan .: 89.80
<S> oh , pardieu , less than nothing , said aramis ; a charming little seamstress , whom i love dearly and from whose hand i requested a few lines as a sort of <UNK> . the <UNK> ! said the swiss , if she is as great a lady as her writing is large , you are a lucky fellow , <UNK> ! aramis read the letter , and passed it to athos .: 112.49
<S> yes .: 18.24
<S> what tenderness , my sister ! but am i not your nearest relative ? demanded milady , with a tone of the most touching ingenuousness .: 104.65
<S> in the bedroom in which this passage ended , bernouin encountered madame de beauvais , like himself intrusted with the secret of these subterranean love affairs ; and madame de beauvais undertook to prepare anne of austria , who was in her oratory with the young king , louis xiv. , to receive the cardinal .: 132.36
<S> does he correspond with aramis ?: 112.61
<S> their jaws moved <UNK> with fearful <UNK> .: 1384.71
<S> the cabinet of m. de tre ville , generally held so sacred , became in an instant the <UNK> of the antechamber .: 62.97
<S> the rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets , filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases , lucca della <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , and <UNK> <UNK> ; of old armchairs , in which perhaps had sat henry iv .: 477.69
<S> vampa , without saying a word , hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto , drew it away , made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there , in a retreat unknown to everyone , closed the stone upon him , and then went and resumed his seat by teresa .: 87.48
<S> then he returned hastily , shut his door carefully , and began to study , like a clever architect , the plan andrea had left him .: 65.49
<S> then i went out of the house ; i proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready .: 47.91
<S> will you examine them . oh , m. beauchamp , if you assure me that m. de morcerf does not know these pistols , you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient . gentlemen , said cha teau renaud , it is not morcerf coming in that carriage ; faith , it is franz and debray ! the two young men he announced were indeed approaching .: 59.66
<S> do not forget that .: 23.43
<S> if he had not courage he had what is very like it , namely , pride .: 108.39
<S> you are setting up an establishment , of course ? why , yes , replied the count .: 33.70
<S> only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count ; for i imagine , just now , that <UNK> cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us .: 125.90
<S> but enough of this here is my card , take it to your master . madame will await my return ? yes ; go . the concierge closed the door , leaving madame danglars in the street .: 64.74
<S> at last , said aramis , we are ready , are we ? yes , monsieur , quite ready , said bazin ; but it took me some time to bring up all the because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadle s robe , and spend all your time reading your breviary .: 80.25
<S> i have just sent away the sentinel that i might remain here without anybody knowing it , in order to speak to you without being overheard .: 63.36
<S> what are you thinking of this evening ? bertuccio sprang out , and offered his shoulder to the count , who , this time , leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage .: 28.43
<S> the count s well known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police , whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice .: 227.99
<S> if i had listened to you , the knife would have been pointed and of steel .: 57.13
<S> he accepted , therefore , with delight , an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the duc de grammont , to give him a substitute ; he also spoke of it to monsieur de chavigny , who promised that he would not oppose it in any way that is , if he approved of the person proposed .: 57.44
<S> monte cristo was at home ; only he was engaged with someone and begged danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing room .: 32.23
<S> his glance , at first wandering , fixed itself upon morrel .: 142.10
<S> advanced a step , and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done .: 89.28
<S> suddenly she heard a step she knew , turned anxiously around , the door opened , and fernand , dressed in the uniform of a sub lieutenant , stood before her .: 68.08
<S> had i been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now , said monte cristo , i must believe on seeing you . caderousse raised his clenched hands towards heaven .: 47.69
<S> now , mousqueton , he said , i hope you don t mean to desert your master ? ah , sir , replied mousqueton , his eyes filling with tears , why did you re enter the army ?: 36.30
<S> d artagnan swam to it and held it , <UNK> himself by this rope , his head alone out of water .: 114.41
<S> one thing now is only <UNK> and that is , that our grooms should not keep us waiting . no , said athos .: 69.38
<S> monte cristo knew everything , as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha ; and , knowing everything , he had advised danglars to write to yanina .: 51.72
<S> by your reckoning i must be forty three at least .: 117.67
<S> this is something new , replied the king .: 15.48
<S> to what do you allude , monsieur ? said danglars ; as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general s words .: 42.75
<S> dost know where porthos is ? no not at all . and aramis ? not in the least . the devil !: 59.72
<S> he , too , ten years ago , had <UNK> sought out a tomb , and sought it vainly .: 169.90
<S> i could almost believe myself at the cafe de paris , murmured danglars .: 52.49
<S> whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to serve , abandon the exterior , the material appearance for the invisible principle , for the invisible principle is everything .: 249.30
<S> he repeated his question .: 38.33
<S> a learned man , before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact , declared he had seen the quarries in question , which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful , but which now assumed the garb of reality .: 195.49
<S> porthos chapter <UNK> .: 139.38
<S> i will now go up into my apartment .: 35.42
<S> la ramee drew near to grimaud , who spoke to him in a low voice .: 14.44
<S> they rode on in this way for ten minutes .: 42.92
<S> but the clerks were not the <UNK> of this deceit , and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances .: 366.58
<S> hear me , maximilian , said his father .: 19.48
<S> i have adopted her as my daughter , having no one else to love in the world . you live alone , then ? i do . you have no sister no son no father ? i have no one . how can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life ? it is not my fault , madame .: 48.34
<S> <UNK> descended in <UNK> , made expressly on the discovery , into the bay where they were thrown ; but of ten three only remained , the rest having been broken by the waves .: 187.87
<S> was it a corps sent out to make a diversion ?: 156.60
<S> raoul !: 54.53
<S> at each cross path was an orchestra , and <UNK> spread with refreshments ; the guests stopped , formed <UNK> , and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased .: 406.84
<S> no , i remain , replied athos , with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed .: 90.38
<S> one day he stopped all at once , and exclaimed : ah , if there were no sentinel ! there shall not be one a minute longer than you please , said dante s , who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its <UNK> operations .: 99.27
<S> milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the count s ; that it is i who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de wardes .: 98.74
<S> but , my lord , think of what you re about to do , and beware of going too far ! what do you say ?: 40.06
<S> i say the two , because cardinal rospigliosi , who had not taken any precaution , was completely despoiled .: 118.50
<S> aramis , at this movement , drew his sword .: 27.46
<S> then , you can let me have some money , can you not ? whatever you say , my dear count ; i am at your orders . why , replied monte cristo , since we mutually understand each other for such i presume is the case ? danglars bowed assentingly .: 44.46
<S> there is the little door opening into the garden .: 33.23
<S> the sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation .: 84.62
<S> ah , monsieur ! said she , you have saved me ; permit me to thank you . madame , said d artagnan , i have only done what every gentleman would have done in my place ; you owe me no thanks . oh , yes , monsieur , oh , yes ; and i hope to prove to you that you have not served an <UNK> .: 25.75
<S> a bad reason , replied danglars , who reckoned on <UNK> his keeper ; but i am content .: 143.19
<S> this frondist duchess trusted so confidently to the power of her fine eyes , that she could not doubt their influence even over monsieur de conde ; and the <UNK> of the time aver that her confidence was justified .: 238.41
<S> the salon downstairs was only an <UNK> divan , for the use of <UNK> .: 406.63
<S> come , come , gentlemen , said mordaunt , impatiently , let us depart . what ! exclaimed porthos without supper ?: 30.24
<S> the queen stopped him .: 19.11
<S> in your place , in truth , sire , i should yield to such powerful instance ; and on my part , it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs . what say you , duke ? i say , sire , that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these never ending labors .: 97.73
<S> oh , unfortunate ! he cried , they must have obtained my arrest . the carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed .: 54.93
<S> if i am to remain here permanently , as monsieur mazarin has kindly given me to understand , i must provide myself with a diversion for my old age , i must turn gourmand . my lord , said la ramee , if you will take a bit of good advice , don t put that off till you are old . good ! said the duc de beaufort to himself , every man in order that he may lose his heart and soul , must receive from celestial <UNK> one of the seven capital sins , perhaps two ; it seems that master la ramee s is <UNK> .: 108.31
<S> as to his going or staying , i feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions ; he shall do what he wishes to do . a transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister ; he looked at the queen with anxiety .: 88.27
<S> but morrel , disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear , was conscious only of the other s condescension .: 217.99
<S> each of them , from time to time , kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them .: 95.06
<S> this dungeon , said the concierge , was , it appears , some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner , the more so since he was full of industry .: 70.74
<S> take it quickly . thereupon she ran toward the carriage , which had turned round toward the way it came , jumped upon the step , and the carriage drove off .: 64.31
<S> commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work ! but , asked danglars , in a timid tone , how did you manage about the other formalities the contract the settlement ? the contract , answered dante s , laughingly , it didn t take long to fix that .: 128.79
<S> the total amount was found to be as m. noirtier had stated .: 208.26
<S> but carlini would not quit the forest , without knowing what had become of rita s father .: 60.11
<S> the trial .: 41.01
<S> laporte entered .: 45.94
<S> at nine o clock the president of the club presented himself ; the general was ready , the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting , and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged , swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage .: 48.77
<S> her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination , and the conviction was <UNK> by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms , who disappeared with the coming of daylight .: 140.32
<S> little <UNK> , perhaps , and that s all .: 78.78
<S> all paris seemed to shout with joy , and then the air resounded with the cries of long live broussel ! long live the coadjutor ! long live the queen ! cried de gondy ; but the cries which replied to his were poor and few , and perhaps he had but uttered it to make anne of austria sensible of her weakness .: 135.83
<S> madame , said athos , when must we set out ? you consent then ? exclaimed the queen , joyfully .: 39.50
<S> come now , recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled monsieur de <UNK> and monsieur de gassion . but a <UNK> general !: 312.94
<S> athos made a sign to the vicomte de bragelonne to remain where he was .: 24.41
<S> pray go , valentine , said ; m. de villefort , and see what this new fancy of your grandfather s is . valentine rose quickly , and was hastening joyfully towards the door , when m. de villefort altered his intention .: 69.02
<S> i name only the most important . you are , doubtless , acquainted with a variety of languages , so as to have been able to read all these ? yes , i speak five of the modern tongues that is to say , german , french , italian , english , and spanish ; by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greek i don t speak it so well as i could wish , but i am still trying to <UNK> myself . <UNK> yourself ! repeated dante s ; why , how can you manage to do so ? why , i made a vocabulary of the words i knew ; turned , returned , and arranged them , so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium .: 100.59
<S> i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherd s life , was vampa s reply .: 35.85
<S> i will swear to you by my soul s salvation , my faith as a christian , i have told everything to you as it occurred , and as the <UNK> angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment ! tis well , said the abbe , convinced by his manner and tone that caderousse spoke the truth .: 67.05
<S> oh , <UNK> !: 71.86
<S> did not you know that , my dear lord ? something of this i heard in epirus , said monte cristo ; but the particulars are still unknown to me .: 46.23
<S> see paragraph 1.e below .: 65.00
<S> there was but one tavern , the post .: 58.28
<S> if you do escape , remember that the poor abbe , whom all the world called mad , was not so .: 63.20
<S> you mentioned a fowl , i think ? yes , a fowl . peppino , turning around , shouted , a fowl for his excellency ! his voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome , graceful , and half naked young man appeared , bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head , without the assistance of his hands .: 131.23
<S> well , grimaud , my friend , have you seen anything ? asked the gascon .: 14.45
<S> she was walking with her nurse <UNK> , in the place where the <UNK> cut the wood , when , passing on horseback , i stopped .: 190.31
<S> well ? asked he .: 8.45
<S> d artagnan signed to them to draw near .: 41.71
<S> there is an abundance of italian masks at the palais royal , from harlequin even to <UNK> . chevalier !: 241.01
<S> i know you now .: 17.24
<S> the minister s wife , pardieu ! oh , your pardon !: 32.81
<S> that s love , or i don t know what love is . come , said danglars , you appear to me a good sort of fellow , and hang me , i should like to help you , but yes , said caderousse , but how ? my dear fellow , replied danglars , you are three parts drunk ; finish the bottle , and you will be completely so .: 41.18
<S> she dreamed don carlos had returned to spain ; she believes in dreams .: 254.44
<S> still i remember he danced three times with her at madame de morcerf s .: 55.23
<S> has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of monsieur de mazarin ?: 101.43
<S> now , as a half smile was sufficient to awaken the <UNK> of the young man , the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined .: 95.11
<S> peste ! you come to your <UNK> quickly .: 136.26
<S> it seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach , for it was there merce de s dwelt .: 64.26
<S> at the third knock , however , steps were heard inside .: 115.01
<S> the repast had been ordered by athos , and the lackey furnished by porthos .: 42.78
<S> come , come , continued he , <UNK> edmond s shoulder kindly , you did very right , dante s , to follow captain leclere s instructions , and touch at elba , although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal , and had conversed with the emperor , it might bring you into trouble . <UNK> how could that bring me into trouble , sir ? asked dante s ; for i did not even know of what i was the bearer ; and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer .: 85.25
<S> the matter was arranged as d artagnan had suggested , and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table , where parry waited on him , harrison and his officers sitting together at another table , and , in a corner , places reserved for himself and his companions .: 83.93
<S> if the king had desired that the letter should be given to him , madame , he would have demanded it of you himself .: 35.44
<S> they all four entered the tent ; they had no plan ready they must think of one .: 161.04
<S> father , he said , do you reflect that you are bidding me to live ? yes , i do so bid you , answered morrel , it is your duty .: 31.60
<S> i thought you would never come in . what s the matter now , planchet ? demanded d artagnan .: 25.62
<S> with the count of morcerf , answered monte cristo .: 22.27
<S> if i had not the hope of peeping with madame coquenard into her husband s chest ! m. coquenard , after the luxuries of such a repast , which he called an excess , felt the want of a siesta .: 114.92
<S> at length , after winding about for a minute or two , mme .: 81.75
<S> he had foreseen all .: 40.00
<S> benedetto ! exclaimed an inspector .: 74.84
<S> it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen ; they had been ushered into madame de villefort s room , who had said she would receive them there .: 36.72
<S> let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment . your lordship does me much honor , said the host , and i thank you sincerely for your kind wish . but don t mistake , said d artagnan , there is more selfishness in my toast than perhaps you may think for it is only in prosperous <UNK> that one is well received .: 87.23
<S> but it must be acknowledged , this response was but momentary .: 109.96
<S> i know you , gentlemen , said the cardinal , i know you .: 11.57
<S> he was in the front row of the crowd , admirably placed for seeing ; and as on the whole the sight was curious , he probably wished to stay to the end . ah comte de la fere , said a calm voice , though hoarse with running , is it your habit to calumniate the absent ? this reproof stung athos to the heart , but as the impression produced by seeing d artagnan foremost in a coarse , ferocious crowd had been very strong , he contented himself with replying : i am not <UNK> you , my friend .: 146.77
<S> he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend , and taking the hands of emmanuel and julie , which he pressed within his own , he said with the mild authority of a father : my kind friends , leave me alone with maximilian . julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic , which monte cristo had forgotten .: 106.29
<S> meantime , mazarin redoubled his <UNK> over the duke .: 166.16
<S> for one moment the young man forgot his habitual respect he threw himself on his father s neck .: 42.57
<S> besides , this time , my visit has a motive . milady trembled ; she thought felton had told all .: 72.52
<S> mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him , announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him .: 92.82
<S> you will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom . the young man remained standing and motionless , having but the force of will and not the power of execution .: 59.75
<S> adieu . adieu , said aramis .: 19.08
<S> albert , beauchamp , and cha teau renaud remained alone .: 25.91
<S> raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host , who rushed into the apartment crying out , the spaniards !: 122.38
<S> bring your comrades here , one and all ; but let everything remain as usual , only close the shutters of the ground floor . and those of the first floor ? you know they are never closed .: 112.56
<S> adieu , adieu ! murmured the old man , clasping edmond s hand convulsively adieu ! oh , no , no , not yet , he cried ; do not forsake me !: 43.83
<S> dante s instantly turned to meet him .: 32.08
<S> read that , he said .: 20.75
<S> at the same time monte cristo s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before , whatever you want , morrel , come to me ; i have great power . more rapidly than thought , he darted down the rue matignon , and thence to the avenue des champs e lyse es .: 55.14
<S> the first thing necessary to render an act valid is , that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act .: 190.89
<S> at seven o clock in the morning he arose and called planchet , who at the second summons opened the door , his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding night .: 46.73
<S> louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword , which stood against a chair in a corner of the room ; but a glance from the worthy broussel , who in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind , checked this foolhardy action of despair .: 67.41
<S> france enfeebled , the authority of her sovereign <UNK> , her nobles returning to their former <UNK> and insolence , her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great richelieu no longer in existence .: 623.84
<S> what do you say of him ?: 7.25
<S> for the first time in his life , danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire ; the time had come when the implacable spectre , which exists in the mind of every human creature , arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart , thou shalt die ! danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase ; first it flies , then <UNK> , and at last , by the very force of <UNK> , sometimes succeeds in eluding its <UNK> .: 270.56
<S> <UNK> i heard his friend , monsieur d artagnan , give him that name . that is it , madame , that is the same .: 33.22
<S> perhaps i may one day put on my best coat , and presenting myself at the great gate , introduce myself .: 154.17
<S> ten minutes after he raised his head ; his resolution was made .: 22.59
<S> i shall ask him . just the very way not to know .: 101.90
<S> the duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into grimaud s hands , but grimaud shook his head .: 43.69
<S> then athos took from his pocket a small paper , on which two lines were written , accompanied by a signature and a seal , and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repugnance .: 59.61
<S> he lowered to earth his eyes , <UNK> raised to heaven , and recognized friquet .: 176.04
<S> the clock struck half past eight , and still another half hour was passed in waiting , while morrel walked to and fro , and gazed more and more frequently through the opening .: 66.20
<S> what is there in them ? he added , putting his lantern on one of the casks .: 48.52
<S> my dear count , said he , i fear one thing , and that is , that the fare of the rue du helder is not so much to your taste as that of the piazza di spagna .: 39.13
<S> his warm and fickle imagination , which in gascony had rendered him formidable to young chambermaids , and even sometimes their mistresses , had never dreamed , even in moments of delirium , of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed .: 301.64
<S> he took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the pont du louvre , but there he met rochefort and his fifty horsemen , attended by more than five hundred men .: 58.50
<S> so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide marks were .: 429.06
<S> we could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us . aha !: 112.66
<S> they threatened me with torture .: 78.54
<S> take it , then , but in exchange caderousse , who touched the diamond , withdrew his hand .: 56.77
<S> have the fugitives been pursued ? yes , my officer ; unfortunately , they are well mounted . how many are there ? four , and a fifth whom they carried away wounded . four ! said d artagnan , looking at porthos .: 76.48
<S> whoever hesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to escape which during that exact second fortune held out to him .: 805.45
<S> the flight .: 72.46
<S> and i idem , said aramis .: 49.36
<S> good , said he , as he went away ; this is a fruitful soil , and i feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground . next morning , faithful to his promise , he sent the prescription requested .: 116.63
<S> where do your excellencies wish to go ? asked he .: 17.79
<S> and i have the same sincerity to show you , if you wish , monsieur d herblay ; i acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me . really , monsieur , you say strange things , said aramis .: 41.57
<S> poor man , he is a worthy creature . he left the porter to ponder on these words , not knowing which most to admire , the master or the servant .: 93.60
<S> i am not a fighting man at all , monsieur , and i am afraid of the bastille . hum ! said d artagnan .: 18.59
<S> but the duke is our friend . the duke is english ; the duke fights against us .: 60.78
<S> did you hear ? said madame danglars .: 11.86
<S> he crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen , who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day ; and this very nearly ruined the minister .: 120.54
<S> maximilian , said he , return home .: 25.12
<S> but before he fainted , he collected all his strength to challenge you , and to defy you while <UNK> you . why , this fellow must be the devil in person ! cried the stranger .: 102.42
<S> what do you say , m. cavalcanti ? ah , said he , we have at <UNK> , <UNK> s tower ; at <UNK> , tasso s prison ; at <UNK> , the room of <UNK> and paolo . yes , but you have not this little staircase , said monte cristo , opening a door concealed by the drapery .: 117.40
<S> well , i know of ten such men . mazarin made no reply ; he reflected .: 33.81
<S> the four friends followed , ten paces behind him .: 29.22
<S> i , monseigneur ? replied milady .: 31.02
<S> guard the prisoners well , i beg of you . the sergeant made a sign , as much as to say he did not understand french , and d artagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures .: 40.71
<S> at last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed .: 95.52
<S> by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself , the young catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt .: 68.35
<S> i shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you . dante s took the hand of the abbe in his , and affectionately pressed it .: 34.86
<S> then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too ?: 140.84
<S> i will offer six millions , and i will content myself with the rest , if they will only give me my liberty . on my word , said the inspector in a low tone , had i not been told beforehand that this man was mad , i should believe what he says . i am not mad , replied faria , with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners .: 30.99
<S> milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat , and who is quite prepared , according to the chances of the battle , to march forward or to beat a retreat .: 142.38
<S> but , said danglars thoughtfully , how is it that your patron , m. de monte cristo , did not make his proposal for you ? andrea blushed imperceptibly .: 53.12
<S> you will see what a fellow he is ; a man who nearly killed mazarin between two doors .: 98.50
<S> if you do not come across one , return for me . the patron shook his head .: 36.10
<S> he then began to visit his friends of both <UNK> , in that strange costume .: 106.02
<S> but i was unable to accept your invitation , having promised to accompany my mother to a german concert given by the baroness of cha teau renaud . this was followed by rather an awkward silence .: 102.25
<S> what has happened ? quick !: 55.90
<S> d artagnan approved with a movement of the head and porthos with his voice .: 32.06
<S> my nephew is not yet king , and you know laporte has told us twenty times that he himself is in need of almost everything . then let us pray to heaven , said the girl .: 74.47
<S> dividing the proceeds the apartment on the first floor of the house in the rue saint germain des pre s , where albert de morcerf had selected a home for his mother , was let to a very mysterious person .: 60.54
<S> madame de villefort , who was in very good spirits , would neither believe nor think of the misfortune , but mademoiselle valentine , at the first words , guessed the whole truth , notwithstanding all the precautions of her father ; the blow struck her like a thunderbolt , and she fell senseless . and how was m. de saint me ran related to mademoiselle de villefort ? said the count .: 42.52
<S> no , replied the turnkey ; you destroy everything .: 56.89
<S> charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile : poor wretch , for half a crown he would do as much to his own father . the king was not mistaken .: 54.73
<S> now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me ; and as i desire to continue to merit the confidence of your eminence , deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise , that i may not commit an error . there was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors .: 58.22
<S> dante s told them that all hands might turn in , and he would take the helm .: 68.35
<S> now it is revealed , this secret so full of horror , as the tragic poet says .: 111.62
<S> mon dieu !: 16.61
<S> the foundation s business office is located at 809 north 1500 west , salt lake city , ut 84116 , 801 596 1887 .: 193.45
<S> you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del monte <UNK> ; here is the priest s certificate . yes indeed , there it is truly , said the italian , looking on with astonishment .: 133.24
<S> in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell , he held open in his left hand , of which alone , it will be recollected , he retained the use , a sheet of paper , which , from being constantly rolled into a small compass , had the form of a <UNK> , and was not easily kept open .: 84.94
<S> i am quite bewildered , and it is natural that it should be so .: 25.26
<S> a musketeer loves women , and he loves them by clasping his arms round them . milady waited , then , with much impatience , for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing felton again .: 108.80
<S> the news , which filled the palace with tears and groans , soon became known , and spread itself throughout the city .: 220.28
<S> have i not , from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance , <UNK> all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas ?: 153.55
<S> well , what is it what is going on here ? said he , in a jeering voice , on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go out .: 29.60
<S> the count looked around him .: 9.70
<S> let us drink ! but then , philosopher that you are , said d artagnan , instruct me , support me .: 70.34
<S> hide thy diamonds , bury thy gold , shroud thy splendor , exchange riches for poverty , liberty for a prison , a living body for a corpse ! as he thus reasoned , monte cristo walked down the rue de la <UNK> .: 459.13
<S> they are these ; never to leave the prisoner alone ; to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument , and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keepers . those are all ? asked grimaud .: 148.80
<S> he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery , and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey , who called out for help .: 71.39
<S> oh , god , thou hast preserved my memory ; i thank thee , i thank thee ! at this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall ; the guide was coming ; monte cristo went to meet him .: 39.52
<S> am i mistaken , then ? said monte cristo .: 15.46
<S> the fact was , nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of vampa , or that of a jockey styled job , when , at the last moment , a splendid roan , mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist , presented themselves at the starting post .: 140.29
<S> bad , monsieur , bad ! replied the king ; i am bored . this was , in fact , the worst complaint of louis xiii. , who would sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say , monsieur so and so , let us weary ourselves together . how !: 95.75
<S> he certainly likes the child , but will he love me less as his affection grows for her ? and athos confessed to himself that , he was <UNK> for so prompt a departure ; but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian .: 182.10
<S> if only we two arrive , said d artagnan , it will be enough , since the duke s troop are only four in number . that is true , said porthos and he spurred his <UNK> on .: 56.97
<S> the king made his way through the crowd without a mask , and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied .: 72.75
<S> if my mother could know of this attention on your part and i will venture to tell her i am sure that she will be most grateful to you ; it is true that my father will be equally angry . the count laughed .: 30.66
<S> i hastened to you , continued beauchamp , to tell you , albert , that in this changing age , the faults of a father can not revert upon his children .: 52.76
<S> then who <UNK> his pistol ? his servant . a nubian ? a negro . it is he , then . do you know this gentleman ? yes , and i am come to look for him ; he is a friend of mine . oh , that is quite another thing , then .: 37.74
<S> however , for my part , i would rather die <UNK> than have anything to say to such a confessor .: 60.23
<S> athos !: 29.01
<S> we shall require it . yes , gentlemen , said d artagnan , we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for <UNK> badly , which , with all due respect , i fancy he is anxious still to do . this new attack made no impression on mordaunt .: 102.54
<S> it was the governor who returned , followed by the doctor and other attendants .: 43.63
<S> now , hastily interrupted the jesuit , on seeing that his <UNK> was going astray , now your thesis would please the ladies ; it would have the success of one of monsieur <UNK> s <UNK> . please god ! cried aramis , transported .: 192.79
<S> he told me your life was his , and i have promised him that you shall live . you have promised him that i shall live ? yes . but , sir , you spoke of vigilance and protection .: 46.78
<S> two angelic faces .: 670.13
<S> if there are two , let parry kill one and you the other .: 126.91
<S> alas , no , sir , replied andrea with a sigh , still more remarkable than the former ones .: 34.26
<S> what ! exclaimed porthos , mutton again ? my dear monsieur de comminges , said d artagnan , you will find that my friend , monsieur du vallon , will go to the most fatal lengths if cardinal mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat ; mutton every day . i declare , said porthos , i shall eat nothing if they do not take it away . remove the mutton , cried comminges ; i wish monsieur du vallon to sup well , more especially as i have news to give him that will <UNK> his appetite . is mazarin dead ? asked porthos .: 78.48
<S> who has told me this fine story , monsieur ?: 35.00
<S> i present them ; but my correspondent has disappeared .: 86.45
<S> the commission is usually one and a half ; will you have two three five per cent , or even more ?: 95.07
<S> danglars , who thought himself threatened certain consciences are never calm , danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror .: 361.19
<S> he found beauchamp pacing the room ; on perceiving him beauchamp stopped .: 100.26
<S> almost all the armed <UNK> that went to the holy land took for their arms either a cross , in honor of their mission , or birds of passage , in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake , and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith .: 190.19
<S> adieu , dear sister , till your next swoon ! this was all that milady could endure .: 111.13
<S> he was moderately reassured , however , by the aspect of that countenance , full of astute intelligence and affected humility .: 147.21
<S> he arose and bowed to the four friends , whose eyes were fixed on charles , while harrison emptied his glass without the slightest misgiving .: 68.69
<S> it seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body , my eyes , which i tried to open , closed against my will , and what will appear impossible above all to you , sir , i saw , with my eyes shut , in the spot where you are now standing , issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into madame villefort s dressing room i saw , i tell you , silently enter , a white figure . valentine screamed .: 112.62
<S> his brain was on fire , and life and energy returned .: 172.40
<S> oh , i entreat you , my son , if you had entertained such an idea , dispel it ; and my counsel to you nay , my prayer is to retain his friendship . mother , replied the young man , you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man . i ? said merce de s , blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale , and again becoming paler than ever .: 48.83
<S> and now , my dear athos , said he , do me the kindness to tell me where we are going ? why , you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion . but what are we going to do there ? you know well that we go to breakfast there . but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot ? because we have very important matters to communicate to one another , and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows , who keep coming in , saluting you , and addressing you .: 48.73
<S> look at that wall without a single window which tells you fine things about mazarin s gratitude ! yes , replied de comminges , more especially if it could reveal how monsieur d artagnan for this last week has been <UNK> him . poor d artagnan said athos , with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character , so brave , so good , so terrible to the enemies of those he loves .: 89.15
<S> during ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay ; at last comminges appeared , pushing broussel before him .: 176.35
<S> ah , my lord , it is a great happiness that the queen , who always wished you well , had a fancy to send you here , where there s a promenade and a tennis court , good air , and a good table . in short , answered the duke , if i comprehend you aright , la ramee , i am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place ? oh !: 73.69
<S> who rang ? asked valentine .: 46.90
<S> the house at auteuil monte cristo noticed , as they descended the staircase , that bertuccio signed himself in the corsican manner ; that is , had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb , and as he seated himself in the carriage , muttered a short prayer .: 77.39
<S> a committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by morcerf .: 228.24
<S> you have managed my affairs so well that i ought to allow you all the time you require for your own .: 41.89
<S> since i set my foot in france , and knew the traitor lived in paris , i have watched carefully .: 89.23
<S> this dinner consisted of <UNK> nicely dressed , choice <UNK> , and superb fruit .: 942.81
<S> had he better deny everything or tell everything ?: 484.04
<S> i do not , madame , rejoined mazarin .: 19.15
<S> in the meanwhile , how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a woman s happiness , and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings .: 192.16
<S> if a question in heraldry were started , athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom , their <UNK> , their <UNK> , their coats of arms , and the origin of them .: 136.91
<S> now , whenever the king halted , the musketeers halted .: 125.58
<S> have they spared me ?: 70.64
<S> the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there , and as he <UNK> his chibouque , see all paris pass before him . you have no idea , then , morrel ? asked cha teau renaud ; you do not propose anything . oh , yes , returned the young man , smiling ; on the contrary , i have one , but i expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him , yet as he has not replied to any of them , i will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel , in the <UNK> style , that my sister has inhabited for a year , in the rue meslay . you have a sister ? asked the count .: 56.99
<S> the tie is even more direct , it seems to me . oh , madame , said villefort , deeply affected , in spite of himself , do not yield to those gloomy thoughts ; you will long live with us , happy , loved , and honored , and we will make you forget never , never , never , said the marchioness .: 55.13
<S> oh , he cried , in an accent of despair , the count has deceived me ; i am yet living ; and extending his hand towards the table , he seized a knife .: 28.51
<S> there was firing , nevertheless , i heard , he said ; and your swords they saw the light of day , i presume ? that is , the night , my lord , i answered .: 62.37
<S> i do not often laugh , sir , replied the stranger , as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance ; but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please . and i , cried d artagnan , will allow no man to laugh when it <UNK> me ! indeed , sir , continued the stranger , more calm than ever ; well , that is perfectly right ! and turning on his heel , was about to re enter the hostelry by the front gate , beneath which d artagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse .: 57.25
<S> the queen gave them to me , the queen requires them again .: 59.85
<S> he lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler ; then , when he was within ten paces of him , he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the traveler s abandoning his purse to save his life .: 56.53
<S> oh , my god , my god ! murmured he , i have so earnestly prayed to you , that i hoped my prayers had been heard .: 24.14
<S> you are stupid , replied the cardinal .: 17.25
<S> the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume .: 214.45
<S> you are pale and agitated . sir , replied the young man , it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor . to mademoiselle de la valliere ? asked athos , quickly .: 33.51
<S> olivain was at the same distance in the rear , when suddenly there resounded five or six musket shots .: 88.09
<S> your pardon , sir , said milady , with mildness .: 25.66
<S> yes , replied franz , here i am , and he , in his turn , left the caves .: 22.45
<S> i thought he was up to something . it s a misfortune , to which his friend , the devil , treats us , said aramis .: 61.15
<S> good lord , how cold i am ! cried planchet , as soon as he had lost sight of his master ; and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the <UNK> of a <UNK> tavern , and knocked at the door .: 54.19
<S> nothing is easier , madame .: 29.58
<S> debray is with madame . danglars nodded his head ; then , turning to monte cristo , said , m .: 46.82
<S> do you think it possible to rouse that as well as provence ? sire , i am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact ; but the feeling in dauphine is quite the reverse of that in provence or languedoc .: 139.22
<S> besides , what was morcerf seeking ?: 165.40
<S> why should my father fly ? he , the all powerful he , before whom others were accustomed to fly he , who had taken for his device , they hate me ; then they fear me ! it was , indeed , a flight which my father was trying to effect .: 132.80
<S> speak , then , i beg of you ; i wait and listen . since there is no harm , said athos , in my knowing that d artagnan is here , i presume there will be none in his knowing that i am here . i have received no orders on that point . well , then , do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that i am his neighbor .: 46.02
<S> do you want anything ? d artagnan shook his head , and set off at full speed .: 12.29
<S> if we had been five ! murmured athos , thinking of d artagnan and porthos .: 28.07
<S> ah , forgive me , said valentine , perceiving the effect which her words were producing on maximilian : i have done wrong , for i have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which i did not even know existed in my heart .: 75.87
<S> encouraged by this discovery , edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer .: 248.11
<S> nevertheless , it was the rendezvous of the great world and all paris went there .: 52.54
<S> i descended rapidly ; although i had not seen villefort s face , i recognized him by the beating of my heart .: 44.03
<S> half past one only ? said he .: 52.44
<S> did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter ? yes . d avrigny reflected a moment ; then approaching noirtier : pardon what i am going to say , added he , but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation .: 69.58
<S> and when ?: 63.82
<S> yours wholly and most affectionately marie de montbazon .: 391.61
<S> morcerf asked leave to retire ; he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm , which his sagacity had foreseen .: 134.91
<S> take some more wine , my dear cavalcanti , said the count , pouring out for him a second glass of alicante ; your emotion has quite overcome you . his poor mother , murmured the major , trying to get the lachrymal <UNK> in operation , so as to <UNK> the corner of his eye with a false tear .: 105.99
<S> every five minutes albert took out his watch ; at length it pointed to seven .: 68.71
<S> at the sight of papers of all sorts , titles , contracts , parchments , which were kept in the archives of the family , all descending from the poisoned cardinal , i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents , like twenty <UNK> , <UNK> , secretaries before me ; but in spite of the most <UNK> researches , i found nothing .: 192.22
<S> but the mind of the procureur was made up ; he felt assured that benedetto was guilty , and he hoped by his skill in conducting this <UNK> case to flatter his self love , which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart .: 166.34
<S> the woman kneels on a prie dieu of painted wood and at a short distance from her stands the young girl , leaning against a chair , weeping .: 195.28
<S> it appears that i had made a mistake , monsieur , that i had arrested the wrong person , and that he whom i ought to have arrested had escaped . but athos ! cried d artagnan , whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities , athos , where is he ? as i was anxious to repair the wrongs i had done the prisoner , resumed the innkeeper , i took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him at liberty .: 44.73
<S> the comte de la fere is not a man . what is he , then ? the comte de la fere is a demi god . has he not a son , a young man , a relative , a nephew , of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy , and who , with monsieur de chatillon , brought the <UNK> from lens ? he has , as your majesty has said , a ward , who is called the vicomte de bragelonne . if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say ? perhaps he would accept . perhaps ? yes , if your majesty herself should beg him to accept . he must be indeed a strange man .: 57.15
<S> as for m. danglars , absorbed in an interesting conversation with m. cavalcanti , he paid no attention to anything that was passing .: 59.19
<S> finally , he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed , and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering ; he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of <UNK> ; and , in short , whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank <UNK> you . sir ! exclaimed the young man , quite astounded , i hope no false report as for myself , i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore , the philanthropist .: 136.09
<S> necessity has no law ; besides , i am the person punished , as that <UNK> horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis , at least .: 193.04
<S> that will fall in wonderfully well ; you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the queen . then the cardinal added , a propos , sire , do not forget to tell her majesty the evening before the fe te that you should like to see how her diamond studs become her . chapter <UNK> .: 77.44
<S> the deuce it is ; unlucky , for my stomach is getting more and more upset . locked ! repeated mousqueton .: 186.24

<S> oh , dear grandmamma , are you worse ? exclaimed valentine , perceiving all these signs of agitation .: 41.80
<S> he was called benedetto , but he is ignorant of his real name , having never known his parents . sign it ! continued the count .: 52.74
<S> oh , yes , scoundrel ! cried milady , seeing the interest which the young officer , whose soul seemed to hang on her lips , took in this strange recital .: 41.74
<S> d artagnan concealed himself in his closet ; milady called , <UNK> , sent away kitty , and shut the door .: 62.32
<S> mazarin !: 58.90
<S> it was indeed mousqueton mousqueton , as fat as a <UNK> , rolling about with rude health , <UNK> out with good living , who , recognizing d artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin , slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off , so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun , which eclipsed the former <UNK> .: 287.28
<S> i don t think so , answered the other ; he s too stupid to imagine such a scheme .: 41.13
<S> you understand , then , comte de la fere , you understand , chevalier d herblay , that i am altogether and always at your service . athos and aramis bowed and went out .: 21.64
<S> d artagnan followed the soubrette with his eyes , and saw her go toward the terrace ; but it happened that someone in the house called lubin , so that planchet remained alone , looking in all directions for the road where d artagnan had disappeared .: 64.09
<S> you know poisons become remedies in certain diseases , of which paralysis is one .: 457.28
<S> the officer reappeared .: 33.26
<S> madame danglars had started when villefort , on the count s invitation , offered his arm ; and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles , when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own .: 64.99
<S> the count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence .: 73.79
<S> the hand of god caderousse continued to call piteously , help , reverend sir , help ! what is the matter ? asked monte cristo .: 50.22
<S> villefort , becoming somewhat reassured , perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head , he must inspire madame danglars with the terror he felt .: 160.47
<S> athos remained motionless , looking after him until he turned the corner of the street .: 30.17
<S> under pretext of trading along the coast , these men , who are in reality smugglers , will prefer selling me to doing a good action .: 294.11
<S> i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me .: 37.71
<S> the monk s eyes glittered .: 36.61
<S> indeed ! said d artagnan , monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy .: 91.31
<S> do you think so ? said the host , bewildered ; boy , see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the stable . there is no mule , cried he to whom this question was addressed .: 74.23
<S> gentlemen , he said , this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through .: 79.81
<S> it must be the son of me re simon who has stolen them ; i saw him <UNK> about here this morning .: 129.88
<S> i present my letter from the queen to the superior , and i bring back the dear treasure i go to seek not into lorraine , not into belgium , but to paris , where she will be much better concealed , particularly while the cardinal is at la rochelle .: 132.58
<S> i do not ask you for liberty , as a guilty one would , nor for vengeance , as would a <UNK> .: 141.80
<S> had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses , i protest i should be <UNK> content , and i would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes , but for to night s adventure i don t suppose my dress would have been a very safe one .: 171.78
<S> the clock striking eight awoke her .: 546.21

<S> this time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them .: 38.07
<S> ha , ha , ha ! and a frightful , <UNK> laugh finished the sentence , which was lost in a hoarse rattle .: 125.27
<S> and the four friends rushed out of the fort , gained the field of battle , picked up the four muskets of the <UNK> and the half pike of the brigadier , and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city , turned again toward the bastion , bearing with them the trophies of their victory .: 73.45
<S> <UNK> , constance bonacieux . or <UNK> de bois tracy . silence , monsieur !: 484.88
<S> and i , said porthos , rolling his large eyes , remember , i will skin you alive . ah , monsieur ! and i , said aramis , with his soft , <UNK> voice , remember that i will roast you at a slow fire , like a savage . ah , monsieur ! planchet began to weep .: 58.93
<S> an awful sadness enveloped the heart of charles .: 175.97
<S> and what have you done to aspire to this honor ? demanded the lieutenant .: 31.45
<S> fate is not more powerful than they ; it is they who , on the contrary , overcome fate .: 77.10
<S> hardly had d artagnan seen , through a <UNK> in his closet , that the whole apartment was in obscurity , than he slipped out of his concealment , at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication .: 103.78
<S> ten young descendants of marius and the gracchi , <UNK> and out at elbows , with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully curved above the head , stared at the traveller , the post chaise , and the horses ; to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the papal states , who earned a <UNK> by <UNK> into the tiber at high water from the bridge of st. angelo .: 300.08
<S> it was nine o clock in the evening ; the sentinels had been relieved at eight and captain groslow had been on guard for an hour .: 38.28
<S> one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering , and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her .: 45.67
<S> first , here is the letter .: 29.69
<S> they are approaching , said she ; perhaps they bring us peace and liberty ! what do you fear , vasiliki ? said selim , in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud .: 77.54
<S> perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so .: 82.11
<S> the sea , smooth as crystal , was now and then disturbed by the leaping of fish , which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in another element ; while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the fishermen s boats , white and graceful as the sea gull , or the merchant vessels bound for corsica or spain .: 209.80
<S> i have not seen you nor your friends , and i don t think you could gather all that dust that i saw planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of paris . you are right , my dear monsieur bonacieux , my friends and i have been on a little journey . far from here ? oh , lord , no !: 56.38

<S> monsieur marechal , you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission ! the irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal .: 209.93
<S> i am her best friend . upon my honor , said rochefort , it takes you , my dear countess , to perform such miracles ! and it is well i can , chevalier , said milady , for do you know what is going on here ? no . they will come for her tomorrow or the day after , with an order from the queen . indeed !: 42.47

<S> the dead , once buried in their graves , rise no more . and i tell you , sir , that you are mistaken .: 64.99
<S> athos said a word to one of the vergers , who bowed and proceeded toward the <UNK> .: 97.04
<S> besides , each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested ; and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving paris full of terrible projects of vengeance , every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to <UNK> ; so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets .: 144.74
<S> p.s . i sign my full name , for i should be vain if i could suppose that after five years of absence you would remember my initials . the poor duke became perfectly giddy .: 107.61

<S> preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit , the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting , that she began by complaining of it .: 114.78
<S> no one must know this secret , my dear , but yourself .: 40.85
<S> it was with him she agreed , and not with me ; he even has in his pocket a letter from that person , who <UNK> great importance to you , as i have heard him say . but how did you become concerned in this villainous affair ? he proposed to me to undertake it with him , and i agreed . and how much did she give you for this fine enterprise ? a hundred louis . well , come ! said the young man , laughing , she thinks i am worth something .: 67.02

<S> if it is i whom your majesty interrogates , replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner , i reply that i hold monsieur le marechal s opinion in every respect . the color mounted to the queen s face ; her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips , compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower , were trembling with anger .: 90.96
<S> i am giving them the slip , said euge nie ; this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty ; we will soon alter our direction . and the young girl jumped into the britzka , which was admirably arranged for sleeping in , without scarcely touching the step .: 103.52

<S> don t laugh , my friend ! cried d artagnan ; for heaven s sake , don t laugh , for upon my soul , it s no laughing matter ! and he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a real appearance of terror , that athos eagerly seized his hand , crying , are you wounded , my friend ?: 49.59
<S> they descended , and advanced towards the clump of trees , and morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as doctor d avrigny .: 78.91
<S> he led the way toward the hill of saint roche .: 70.08

<S> oh , fear nothing , madame ! said the young woman , clasping her hands and weeping herself at the queen s sorrows ; i am your majesty s , body and soul , and however far i may be from you , however inferior may be my position , i believe i have discovered a means of extricating your majesty from your trouble . you , oh , heaven , you ! cried the queen ; but look me in the face .: 58.47

<S> you said you were but three , but it appears to me we are four . but you are not one of us , said porthos .: 27.51

<S> caderousse looked so closely at it that andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect .: 103.14

<S> why , in the first place , his yacht is not a ship , but a bird , and he would beat any <UNK> three knots in every nine ; and if he were to throw himself on the coast , why , is he not certain of finding friends everywhere ? it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad , franz s host , had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean , and so enjoyed <UNK> privileges .: 112.29

<S> my letter of recommendation ! cried d artagnan , my letter of recommendation !: 66.92
<S> he awaited mazarin s promised visit to get some light on his present situation .: 181.18
<S> it is the count s reply . poor kitty became as pale as death ; she suspected what the letter contained .: 57.37
<S> the queen had confidence in the courage of d artagnan , which she knew , and the cardinal in the strength of porthos , which he had experienced .: 32.27
<S> by men of heart i mean men of courage .: 154.71
<S> bonacieux had also reflected ; but , it must be admitted , upon something <UNK> different from ambition .: 234.46
<S> i was about to say to these gentlemen , added he , that i forbid my musketeers to expose their lives needlessly ; for brave men are very dear to the king , and the king knows that his musketeers are the bravest on the earth .: 66.49
<S> bravo ! said athos ; that does honor to your imagination . all very well , said porthos , but i should like to understand . let us decamp first , and you will understand afterward . a moment , gentlemen , a moment ; give grimaud time to clear away the breakfast . ah , ah ! said aramis , the black points and the red points are visibly enlarging .: 92.19
<S> what company ? company of tre ville . advance , and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour . the three companions advanced rather humbly for all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves leaving athos the post of speaker .: 129.69
<S> chevalier ! said athos .: 18.54
<S> you have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels , always followed by such happy results . alas , dear friend ! said aramis , our late adventures have disgusted me with military life .: 105.50
<S> towards the house the chestnut trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall , without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant <UNK> , as though <UNK> their right to enjoy the boon of light and air .: 463.85
<S> do you wish to go on the water , sir ? said the sailor .: 15.66
<S> it is not at all amusing here ; there is not a single woman passing . hush ! said athos , we are overheard . in truth , the <UNK> , who , during the observations of the two friends , had passed and repassed behind them several times , stopped at the name of de winter ; but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name , it might have been by chance he stood so still .: 65.77
<S> as soon as the door was closed : sire , said aramis , speaking rapidly , you are saved ; the london executioner has vanished .: 54.92
<S> now to horse , that i may see you depart ! raoul obeyed .: 61.09
<S> yield you yield to me , do you not ? a giant had seized also aramis s two wrists , who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp .: 194.64
<S> broussel s son was there , still furious , and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the king s officers .: 167.69
<S> have you forgotten that m. debray has just seen you at my house ? ah , true . fix it this way .: 47.39
<S> the marriage feast the morning s sun rose clear and resplendent , touching the <UNK> waves into a network of ruby tinted light .: 617.39
<S> the horse started , brushed against the imprudent man , who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest , and he fell against the wall .: 69.90
<S> i have already told you , father , that woman , under that angelic appearance , had an infernal soul , and when i saw her , when i recalled all the evil she had done to me to you ?: 44.07
<S> yes , i have need of it . the mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility , such earnest repentance , that gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the <UNK> of which he was capable .: 50.62
<S> monte cristo shook it coldly , according to his <UNK> practice .: 164.58
<S> all s well , he cried , as he entered ; i have hired a <UNK> <UNK> , as light as a canoe , as easy on the wing as any swallow .: 193.13
<S> you already know two of them , and you appeared to appreciate them like a judge .: 67.20
<S> thanks , guitant ; i shall benefit by your advice this very evening . here they separated and bidding adieu to guitant in the court of the palais royal , mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down within that inclosure .: 126.39
<S> the contract three days after the scene we have just described , namely towards five o clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between mademoiselle euge nie danglars and andrea cavalcanti , whom the banker persisted in calling prince , a fresh breeze was <UNK> the leaves in the little garden in front of the count of monte cristo s house , and the count was preparing to go out .: 59.37
<S> a miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after five and twenty years of exile .: 125.05
<S> project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread works not protected by u.s. copyright law in creating the project gutenberg collection .: 68.73
<S> if we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch , from which the devil himself could not take us out .: 80.76
<S> these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit ; there were sicily pine apples , <UNK> from malaga , oranges from the <UNK> <UNK> , peaches from france , and dates from tunis .: 857.38
<S> since my convalescence i have so many affairs of this kind on my hands that i am forced to regulate them a little .: 68.24
<S> could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute ?: 428.23
<S> does your honor want a horse ? asked mousqueton .: 42.98
<S> he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries , which , on rising suddenly , he let fall from his hand .: 97.24
<S> his words were brief and expressive , conveying all that was meant , and no more ; no <UNK> , no embroidery , no arabesques .: 275.70
<S> by the light of a lamp he saw a woman , wrapped in a dark mantle , seated upon a stool near a dying fire .: 43.72
<S> the prisoner s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air for air is freedom ; but he soon sighed , for he passed before la re serve , where he had that morning been so happy , and now through the open windows came the laughter and <UNK> of a ball .: 168.67
<S> that is the crime of which i accuse her ; that is the cause for which she was branded . monsieur d artagnan , said athos , what is the penalty you demand against this woman ? the punishment of death , replied d artagnan .: 21.78
<S> he gallantly offered the right hand seat to beppo , and sat by him .: 136.60
<S> at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil .: 74.86
<S> he told me to watch you . and why so ?: 28.07
<S> who goes there ? inquired the captain of the patrol .: 30.17
<S> porthos was magnificent ; his spurs jingled , his cuirass glittered , his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs .: 341.10
<S> that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian , she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden , being anxious to show that the delay , which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him , was not occasioned by any neglect on her part .: 63.27
<S> i informed them at the hotel that i had the honor of passing the night here , duke , said franz , and desired them to come and inform me of his return . ah , replied the duke , here i think , is one of my servants who is seeking you . the duke was not mistaken ; when he saw franz , the servant came up to him .: 31.61
<S> women of a certain <UNK> are like prosperous <UNK> in one respect , they seldom return home after twelve o clock .: 328.70
<S> about half past six . we will be with you at that time , said the major .: 23.98
<S> the inspector begged the englishman to seat himself in an armchair , and placed before him the register and documents relative to the cha teau d if , giving him all the time he desired for the examination , while de boville seated himself in a corner , and began to read his newspaper .: 52.81
<S> bonacieux retired .: 61.54
<S> he therefore seized the little epistle , and opened it eagerly .: 55.14
<S> franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day , both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents ; nor did he say more than the truth , for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved , he was looked upon and <UNK> as a model of perfection .: 104.67
<S> this knife was my only hope .: 54.07
<S> the note is changed .: 41.56
<S> constance ? replied the young man , where are you ?: 33.28
<S> and this explains how d artagnan had quarters in the rue tiquetonne , at the hotel de la chevrette .: 34.60
<S> and the prisoner , he continued aloud , was he ever heard of afterwards ? oh , no ; of course not .: 66.55
<S> oh , it is impossible to doubt it , cried he , suddenly .: 18.86
<S> ridicule , sir why , you know not its power in france , and yet you ought to know it ! sire , sire , murmured the minister , for pity s approach , m. de villefort , resumed the king , addressing the young man , who , motionless and breathless , was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom .: 52.79
<S> yes , monsieur , i know only him . well , but then , continued athos , speaking half to himself , if i kill you , i shall have the air of a boy <UNK> . not too much so , replied d artagnan , with a bow that was not <UNK> in dignity , since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient . very inconvenient , upon my word ; and you hurt me devilishly , i can tell you .: 59.90
<S> yes , we are young ; yes , we shall yet have happy days !: 76.38
<S> perhaps , not being endowed with the endurance of athos , who seemed to be made of iron , he would have preferred a bath in the river seine of which he had heard so much , and afterward his bed ; but the comte de la fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey .: 53.08
<S> after reading the letter , villefort covered his face with his hands .: 36.42
<S> he remained listening and gazing .: 54.54
<S> hayde e s nervous system is delicately organized , and she is peculiarly susceptible to the <UNK> even of flowers nay , there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence .: 415.39
<S> now , madame , said debray , delivering up his accounts in the <UNK> manner of a <UNK> , there are still <UNK> francs , the interest of this money , in my hands . but , said the baroness , i thought you never put the money out to interest . excuse me , madame , said debray coldly , i had your permission to do so , and i have made use of it .: 49.74
<S> faithful friend , noble heart ! said the king , i should not have been rescued .: 44.41
<S> edward raised his head , looked at his mother , and then , finding that she did not confirm the order , began cutting off the heads of his leaden soldiers .: 71.68
<S> as for the ink , said faria , i told you how i managed to obtain that and i only just make it from time to time , as i require it . one thing still puzzles me , observed dante s , and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight ? i worked at night also , replied faria .: 74.06
<S> i live there during my leave of absence , continued maximilian ; and i shall be , together with my brother in law emmanuel , at the disposition of the count , whenever he thinks fit to honor us . one minute , cried albert , without giving monte cristo the time to reply .: 70.29
<S> again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening , and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the <UNK> ; but it wore the same wild , barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the <UNK> glimmer of eve .: 342.07
<S> but i wonder she is not here .: 44.22
<S> as for monte cristo , after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light .: 62.43
<S> and on what floor does he live ? asked comminges .: 40.80
<S> at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him .: 15.49
<S> can my influence with them be of any service to you ? oh , count , you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been , up to the present , fruitless .: 116.58
<S> he would fain have continued , but his knees trembled , and his heart beat so violently , and his sight became so dim , that he was forced to pause .: 43.27
<S> five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle d armilly s fingers , and mademoiselle danglars was singing <UNK> s malediction on <UNK> .: 255.08
<S> ah , said monte cristo , taking it from her hand .: 13.10
<S> but still , we have quite lost our dear euge nie ; for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france . still , baron , said monte cristo , family griefs , or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure , are endurable to a millionaire .: 106.42
<S> if i had had a single ornament left , i should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself . oh , madame , said mazarin , your majesty knows not what you ask .: 53.06
<S> he found outside the door the old servant , to whom valentine had given directions .: 66.00
<S> as for you , your captain is the prince , understand that rightly ; you have no other .: 67.50
<S> i am credited on you for six millions .: 75.76
<S> i shall use it again upon occasion . and with all the <UNK> of his legs , already a little fatigued , however , with the <UNK> of the day , d artagnan directed his course toward m. de tre ville s .: 61.42
<S> nevertheless , you ought to remember that that great , that sublime monarch , when proscribed at one time , as my husband may be , demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him ; and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece . peccato ! said mazarin , writhing beneath this simple eloquence , your majesty does not understand me ; you judge my intentions wrongly , and that is partly because , doubtless , i explain myself in french . speak italian , sir .: 143.63
<S> apropos , she said , as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself , how is poor voiture , do you know , scarron ? what , is monsieur voiture ill ? inquired a gentleman who had spoken to athos in the rue saint honore ; what is the matter with him ? he was acting , but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance , said the coadjutor , so he took cold and is about to die . is he then so ill , dear voiture ? asked aramis , half hidden by the window curtain .: 81.91
<S> such news was decisive ; it destroyed , in favor of the court , the struggle commenced with parliament .: 145.51
<S> well ? asked the two gendarmes .: 24.43
<S> why the devil , then , do we plague ourselves about money , when there is a diamond ? stop a bit ! said aramis .: 72.63
<S> her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it , by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so ; for , were it once discovered by her father and mother , all would be lost .: 63.07
<S> and you will add to them this knife , said the duke , pressing the hand of laporte .: 27.23
<S> the comte de la fere inhabits the castle of bragelonne , in the environs of that city . chapter xiii .: 28.87
<S> he leaped from his charger , placed his back against the <UNK> of the carriage , making a rampart of his horse , drew his pistols from their holsters and fastened them to his belt , and began to fight with the back sword , like a man accustomed to the handling of his weapon .: 47.06
<S> almost directly afterwards , without the usual interval of time , a cab arrived , and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs .: 132.51
<S> but , there , he is in the hands of justice ; and , added he with a smile , she will take her own . so saying , he leaped into a boat , desiring to be rowed on board the pharaon , where m. morrel had agreed to meet him .: 40.23
<S> aramis looked after them , and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of athos .: 41.25
<S> why , to converse with him , of course .: 29.66
<S> question , then , my lord . where did the army cross the lys ? between saint <UNK> and <UNK> . by whom is it commanded ? by count de <UNK> , general <UNK> and the archduke . of how many does it consist ? eighteen thousand men and thirty six cannon . and its aim is ? lens . you see ; gentlemen ! said the prince , turning with a triumphant air toward marshal de grammont and the other officers .: 229.68
<S> i respect old age , but i don t much like it boiled or roasted . and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion ; but on the contrary , he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring , in anticipation , that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt .: 127.03
<S> the host , his mind at ease about his bill , placed pen , ink and paper upon the table .: 77.29
<S> before or after , whichever you please . opposite the scaffold ? the scaffold forms part of the fe te . count , i have reflected on the matter , said franz , i thank you for your courtesy , but i shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace , and i leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del popolo . but i warn you , you will lose a very curious sight , returned the count .: 58.22
<S> one of them , stationed upon the top stair , naked sword in hand , prevented , or at least endeavored to prevent , the three others from ascending .: 154.68
<S> the day passed thus ; he scarcely tasted food , but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage .: 138.33
<S> you know the rest . milady knew that lord de winter lied , and she was the more alarmed .: 60.51
<S> she entered the office where emmanuel was , while cocles , by the aid of a key he possessed , opened a door in the corner of a landing place on the second staircase , conducted the stranger into an antechamber , opened a second door , which he closed behind him , and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson french alone , returned and signed to him that he could enter .: 50.86
<S> you wish to see blois again ; it is but natural . then you permit me to go , you are not angry in your heart ? exclaimed raoul , joyously .: 45.65
<S> at neufcha tel , as at st. valery , he found a horse quite ready and awaiting him .: 87.96
<S> oh , sir ! exclaimed raoul , recognizing the young man as having seen him in the rue <UNK> , spare him !: 68.97
<S> london .: 196.69
<S> what these happy persons took for reality was but a dream ; but it was a dream so soft , so voluptuous , so enthralling , that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them , and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity , struck down the designated victim , died in torture without a murmur , believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy <UNK> , now before you , had given them a slight <UNK> . then , cried franz , it is hashish !: 198.91
<S> villefort , being called on to prove the crime , was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases .: 128.65
<S> the young man remained immovable .: 17.97
<S> have they allowed the headsman to escape ? suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square .: 341.20
<S> the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart , for whom , i hope , you re preparing a pretty trial . why , said groslow , that is just what we are taking him to london for . and you never by any chance lose sight of him , i presume ? i should think not , indeed .: 74.01
<S> either you are a demon , continued felton , or the baron my benefactor , my father is a monster .: 61.27
<S> an instant afterwards the door opened , she felt two arms encircle her , and a mouth pressed her forehead .: 78.17
<S> raoul gives me much uneasiness , he said .: 43.67
<S> the miserable villain !: 132.58
<S> the days of expectation are long , and d artagnan , in particular , would have <UNK> that the days were forty four hours .: 87.91
<S> death is now , perhaps , striking a fourth blow .: 95.56
<S> planchet turned and returned the billet .: 79.15
<S> she could scarcely believe in her happiness ; and d artagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written .: 59.12
<S> take care , i repeat to you , take care .: 20.50
<S> since you say i am sold . to cross the tyne , reach scotland and rejoin lord <UNK> , who will not sell you . and what shall i do in scotland ?: 129.13
<S> gentlemen , said mazarin , i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects .: 45.99
<S> the young man knelt down .: 19.29
<S> all i can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that providence . the bargain was concluded .: 82.95
<S> de winter took us to the house of a spaniard , who , he said , had become <UNK> as an englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots .: 69.68
<S> you will say that i keep it . i will perform your commission , word for word , my lord . and now , resumed buckingham , looking earnestly at the young man , how shall i ever <UNK> myself of the debt i owe you ? d artagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes .: 59.96
<S> at these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of athos .: 65.23
<S> now , while admiring , as others doubtless will admire , the details we have to relate , our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought .: 253.28
<S> we are friends ; are we not ? she asked .: 16.63
<S> long live the coadjutor ! cried the crowd .: 68.49
<S> rochefort had returned to the chevalier d humieres his fifty horsemen , less two , missing at roll call .: 359.37
<S> in order that his wounds might be examined he was <UNK> , and his clothes were thrown into a corner , where the police picked them up , with the exception of the waistcoat , which they overlooked . andrea turned pale , and drew towards the door ; he saw a cloud rising in the horizon , which appeared to <UNK> a coming storm .: 68.12
<S> i left the boat between bellegarde and beaucaire , and took the road to ni mes . we are getting to the story now ? yes , your excellency ; excuse me , but , as you will see , i only tell you what is absolutely necessary .: 40.89
<S> i may be besieged in my turn , and i shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your master . lord , monsieur !: 42.29
<S> besides , his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me .: 85.65
<S> la carconte then entered her chamber , the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy , uncertain tread , as she proceeded towards her armchair , into which she fell as though exhausted .: 107.75
<S> you have restored my courage by a single word ; go , i will rejoin you . milady ran up to her apartment quickly ; she there found rochefort s lackey , and gave him his instructions .: 59.76
<S> i am sorry to say i must do so , madame , i only came to remind you of your promise for saturday . did you fear that we should forget it ? you are very good , madame , but m. de villefort has so many important and urgent occupations . my husband has given me his word , sir , said madame de villefort ; you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose , and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain . and , said villefort , is it at your house in the champs e lyse es that you receive your visitors ? no , said monte cristo , which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritorious , it is in the country . in the country ? yes . where is it , then ?: 43.79
<S> they accepted his offer ; but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left , albert started for naples .: 96.87
<S> meanwhile , all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions , as the wound might be serious , he immediately sent off a mounted man to find a physician .: 172.26
<S> i see you are covered with blood ! i believe , said raoul , that i have got something like a scratch on the arm .: 38.10
<S> this was , in fact , a custom familiar to him .: 38.07
<S> the magistrate was seated in an armchair , writing , with his back towards the door ; he did not move as he heard it open , and the door keeper pronounce the words , walk in , madame , and then <UNK> it ; but no sooner had the man s footsteps ceased , than he started up , drew the bolts , closed the curtains , and examined every corner of the room .: 66.77
<S> upon my soul , that future captain of mine is a lucky dog !: 104.43
<S> dante s noticed that the captain of la jeune ame lie had , as he <UNK> the land , mounted two small <UNK> , which , without making much noise , can throw a four <UNK> ball a thousand paces or so .: 151.19
<S> at this moment one of the door keepers brought in a letter for the president .: 43.04
<S> the bustle which had been observed by henrietta maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason , was occasioned by the battle of lens , announced by the prince s messenger , the duc de chatillon , who had taken such a noble part in the engagement ; he was , besides , charged to hang five and twenty flags , taken from the lorraine party , as well as from the spaniards , upon the arches of notre dame .: 108.32
<S> jussac , anxious to put an end to this , springing forward , aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary , but the latter parried it ; and while jussac was recovering himself , glided like a serpent beneath his blade , and passed his sword through his body .: 122.93
<S> nature has made us thus ; she makes the young look ever forward , not behind .: 360.83
<S> this boat contained an officer , a mate , and eight rowers .: 99.96
<S> but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man , and perhaps in that of the old man , many repressed desires , many stifled sighs , which found vent when faria was left alone , and when edmond returned to his cell .: 117.35
<S> go . the lackey bowed to the ground and departed .: 42.60
<S> oh , if she betrayed your majesty on the side of your honor , it would be quite another thing , and i should be the first to say , no grace , sire no grace for the guilty ! happily , there is nothing of the kind , and your majesty has just acquired a new proof of it . that is true , monsieur cardinal , said the king , and you were right , as you always are ; but the queen , not the less , deserves all my anger . it is you , sire , who have now incurred hers .: 47.45
<S> it has four hundred lines , and lasts a minute . my faith , my dear aramis , said d artagnan , who detested verses almost as much as he did latin , add to the merit of the difficulty that of the <UNK> , and you are sure that your poem will at least have two merits . you will see , continued aramis , that it <UNK> irreproachable passion .: 101.32
<S> we can only save you by being free ourselves , replied d artagnan , in a rapid , low tone ; and if we appear inclined to defend you , they will arrest us with you . it seems , nevertheless come , gentlemen , come ! said d artagnan , aloud ; i have no motive for defending monsieur .: 41.56
<S> are you alone , athos ? parbleu ! whom do you expect to find with me at this hour ? well , well ! and d artagnan rushed into athos s chamber .: 29.30
<S> he had good cause to do so ; the pain i gave him must have been atrocious .: 115.89
<S> you are of my opinion , are you not , viscount ?: 18.67
<S> those who had kept their shares , or bought those of danglars , looked upon themselves as ruined , and passed a very bad night .: 114.01
<S> the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me , the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people . that s right ! cried morrel .: 99.31
<S> now , as d artagnan used no ceremony with aramis , seeing that bazin forgot to announce him , he announced himself .: 77.88
<S> musketeers ! cried d artagnan .: 15.69
<S> he recognized mordaunt , who with bare sword was <UNK> the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches .: 176.16
<S> her skin was admired for its velvety <UNK> ; her hands and arms were of surpassing beauty , all the poets of the time singing them as incomparable .: 385.84
<S> she looked at him in amazement .: 16.05
<S> ah ! said mazarin to himself , what a sweet face ; does she come to borrow money of me ? and he threw an uneasy glance at his strong box ; he even turned inside the <UNK> of the magnificent diamond ring , the brilliancy of which drew every eye upon his hand , which indeed was white and handsome .: 112.10
<S> adieu , brother ! cried milady .: 22.04
<S> the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound ; but , to his astonishment , the room was suddenly illuminated .: 74.92
<S> franz and the count descended these , and found themselves in a mortuary chamber .: 66.93
<S> you did well to defend the honor of a woman ; and as i am going to the red dovecot myself , i shall know if you have told me the truth . monseigneur , said athos , haughtily , we are gentlemen , and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood . therefore i do not doubt what you say , monsieur athos , i do not doubt it for a single instant ; but , added he , to change the conversation , was this lady alone ? the lady had a cavalier shut up with her , said athos , but as notwithstanding the noise , this cavalier did not show himself , it is to be presumed that he is a coward . judge not rashly , says the gospel , replied the cardinal .: 47.19
<S> oh , god ! exclaimed the poor queen , raising her eyes to heaven , have you indeed taken back all the generous hearts that once existed in the world ? i hope not , madame , replied de winter , thoughtfully ; i once spoke to you of four men . what can be done with four ? four devoted , resolute men can do much , assure yourself , madame ; and those of whom i speak performed great things at one time . and where are these four men ? ah , that is what i do not know .: 55.49
<S> the world is not wanting in attractions .: 99.28
<S> what will it signify if one , two , or three more are added ?: 147.75
<S> grimaud had now finished his accounts .: 49.57
<S> have we overtaken them ? good !: 128.27
<S> the door was closed , and the carriage proceeded .: 9.71
<S> on !: 53.45
<S> and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there .: 20.58
<S> who was the invisible chief ?: 152.75
<S> he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street , pacing the chamber with restless steps , stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels , then to cast an anxious glance on ali ; but the regularity with which the nubian <UNK> forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation .: 148.78
<S> let us , then , hope for the best ; hope is so sweet a <UNK> .: 90.48
<S> two eggs and some fruit composed my repast ; then i drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain , and drank it .: 190.90
<S> monte cristo , seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it , and not wishing to carry it too far , said : come , gentlemen , some coffee , we seem to have forgotten it , and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn .: 63.33
<S> it is an every day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not . morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness ; valentine looked at him a moment with her large , scrutinizing eyes , endeavoring not to let morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart .: 140.07
<S> sign , my lord , and he gave him a pen .: 26.54
<S> alone ? asked athos .: 21.41
<S> valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety , and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her , she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy .: 91.68
<S> it is you who stabbed selim .: 73.54
<S> then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played , drank , sang , but that whilst playing , drinking , singing , he often stopped short to vow that mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at vincennes .: 233.96
<S> peste ! edmond , you have a very handsome mistress ! she is not my mistress , replied the young sailor , gravely ; she is my betrothed . sometimes one and the same thing , said morrel , with a smile .: 37.30
<S> the rochellais had at last taken possession of the bastion .: 35.19
<S> it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone .: 162.92
<S> ; in three days m. bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars , large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house , and in the <UNK> , instead of the usual paving stones , half hidden by the grass , there extended a lawn but that morning laid down , and upon which the water was yet glistening .: 249.11
<S> this time the poor girl did not even argue with d artagnan ; she gave it to him at once .: 31.12
<S> coquenard ; the coffer so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres .: 361.94
<S> afterward mme .: 65.94
<S> bonacieux ; somebody is coming . immediately the door opened , and the superior entered .: 42.00
<S> the abbe busoni , said la carconte .: 11.98
<S> i thought i had , said porthos , resuming his melancholy air ; but i have been taught my mistake . you have some ! cried the procurator s wife , in a transport that surprised even herself .: 50.82
<S> i feel <UNK> over my whole body . do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes ? yes . any noise in the ears ? frightful . <UNK> when did you first feel that ? just now . suddenly ? yes , like a clap of thunder . did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before ? nothing . no drowsiness ? none . what have you eaten today ? i have eaten nothing ; i only drank a glass of my master s lemonade that s all . and barrois turned towards noirtier , who , <UNK> fixed in his armchair , was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him .: 122.61
<S> he breakfasted heartily , and caring little , as he said , for the beauties of the eternal city , ordered post horses at noon .: 146.58
<S> i killed one man , if i recollect rightly , replied d artagnan , with a look of inquiry directed to athos ; another i disarmed or wounded , i don t remember which . wounded ! said athos ; it was a <UNK> of skill . the young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night , but athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose .: 106.32
<S> which , asked he , the viscount or the count ? the count . oh , exclaimed hayde e , is it not yet over ? i know not if it is finished , my beloved child , said monte cristo , taking the young girl s hands ; but i do know you have nothing more to fear . but it is the wretched that man can not injure me , hayde e , said monte cristo ; it was his son alone that there was cause to fear . and what i have suffered , said the young girl , you shall never know , my lord . monte cristo smiled .: 31.80
<S> never mind , said milady , writing the name on half a sheet of paper ; i will compromise myself . well , said rochefort , taking the paper from milady , folding it , and placing it in the lining of his hat , you may be easy .: 36.16
<S> but what if i am not liberated , cried he , and am detained here until my death ?: 86.16
<S> milady had already rung her bell , and roused the whole ho tel .: 99.74
<S> by your <UNK> ? no , i have given up poetry , except now and then to write a drinking song , some gay <UNK> or some innocent <UNK> ; i compose sermons , my friend . what !: 345.53
<S> it is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count .: 34.28
<S> if your daughter had committed only one crime , and i saw her meditating another , i would say warn her , punish her , let her pass the remainder of her life in a convent , weeping and praying . if she had committed two crimes , i would say , here , m. de villefort , is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted with , one that has no known antidote , quick as thought , rapid as lightning , mortal as the thunderbolt ; give her that poison , recommending her soul to god , and save your honor and your life , for it is yours she <UNK> at ; and i can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations .: 143.59
<S> read for yourself and judge . porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words : the queen wishes to speak to monsieur d artagnan , who must follow the bearer . well ! exclaimed porthos ; i see nothing in that very extraordinary . but i see much that is very extraordinary in it , replied d artagnan .: 37.47
<S> your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me , and i am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require . this manner of acting roused much respect for d artagnan s policy among the musketeers .: 144.70
<S> if you know monsieur de tre ville , you must have visited him ? often ! said milady , who , having entered this track , and perceiving that falsehood succeeded , was determined to follow it to the end .: 47.05
<S> that horse was to have <UNK> us in the day of battle .: 70.07
<S> unfortunately , in this world of ours , each person views things through a certain medium , and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others , and madame danglars , therefore , very much regretted that the marriage of euge nie had not taken place , not only because the match was good , and likely to insure the happiness of her child , but because it would also set her at liberty .: 95.35
<S> night came , and at ten o clock they anchored .: 36.15
<S> if you do , i swear to you , for i have got to the end of my strength , that i will dash my brains out against the wall , and you will have my death to reproach yourself with . how old are you ?: 27.42
<S> as he came near the hotel , franz saw a man in the middle of the street .: 19.13
<S> he then tried to draw him from his moist abode , but to his surprise he perceived that athos staggered .: 71.89
<S> my dear mr. mordaunt , said mazarin , hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the young man in a snare , how extremely your history interests me !: 108.12
<S> it was now athos s turn to take a sly look .: 61.35
<S> what has he done , madame ? said d artagnan .: 7.48
<S> it is true i fought with tolerable success . i don t speak of your warlike exploits , monsieur , said mazarin ; although they gained you much reputation , they were surpassed by others . d artagnan pretended astonishment .: 122.75
<S> i have eight men on guard , you know .: 42.36
<S> i gave it away in a night of love , as it has been given to you . d artagnan became pensive in his turn ; it appeared as if there were abysses in milady s soul whose depths were dark and unknown .: 62.70
<S> oh !: 10.00
<S> is monsieur d artagnan there ? yes , madame , in your oratory .: 42.50
<S> i escaped the morcerf only to fall into the cavalcanti . oh , do not confound the two , euge nie . hold your tongue !: 94.54
<S> now leave me or i will summon my servants to throw you out at the door . wild , almost unconscious , and with eyes inflamed , albert stepped back , and morrel closed the door .: 73.97
<S> i was reflecting , in the first place , replied dante s , upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained .: 73.75
<S> in fact , mousqueton had not concealed from his master that he had met d artagnan and aramis , and that d artagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the be arnese pony upon which he had come to paris , and which he had sold for three crowns .: 34.29
<S> instead of shutting yourself up here as if you were under arrest , get on horseback and come and take a ride with me to st. germain . my dear fellow , said athos , i ride horses when i have any ; when i have none , i go afoot . well , said d artagnan , smiling at the misanthropy of athos , which from any other person would have offended him , i ride what i can get ; i am not so proud as you .: 57.77
<S> there they inquired and learned that the prince had in reality quitted bethune and stationed himself between <UNK> and la venthie .: 241.34
<S> i want all my household at auteuil . but will no one remain in the house , my lord ? asked baptistin .: 35.56
<S> i am not going there to be imprisoned , said dante s ; it is only used for political prisoners .: 44.68
<S> i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress . but then you would be close to the sea ? that is what i hoped . and supposing you had succeeded ? i should have thrown myself into the sea , gained one of the islands near here the isle de <UNK> or the isle de tiboulen and then i should have been safe . could you have swum so far ? heaven would have given me strength ; but now all is lost . all ? yes ; stop up your excavation carefully , do not work any more , and wait until you hear from me . tell me , at least , who you are ? i am i am no .: 88.93
<S> we are lost , said d artagnan , in the ear of athos .: 10.10
<S> why , there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered .: 30.04
<S> thanks to the cares of mousqueton , the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the interior .: 109.19
<S> the <UNK> were deserted , houses closed ; every one wished to see the young king with his mother , and the famous cardinal mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his presence .: 78.95
<S> have you really measured the world by <UNK> , or through <UNK> and <UNK> ?: 484.21
<S> one of the last , as you see ; if you hear anything of monsieur voiture , be so kind as to send me word to morrow . oh ! said scarron , he may die now . why ? asked the young girl with the velvet eyes .: 43.04
<S> then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows .: 44.57
<S> do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were ? oh !: 61.25
<S> uneasy and almost <UNK> , she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather .: 63.18
<S> d artagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur , and at the same time leaving some trace of himself . they went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur , at the counter as their friends must have done before them .: 100.83
<S> i am a stranger , and a stranger to such a degree , that this is the first time i have ever been at paris .: 22.94
<S> yes , do , said the duchess .: 18.62
<S> yet thither it was that dante s guided his vessel , and at monte cristo he arrived at the close of the second day ; his boat had proved herself a first class sailor , and had come the distance from genoa in thirty five hours .: 114.21
<S> there is but one favor i would entreat of you . speak . guard carefully the secret of your birth .: 166.12
<S> well , said he to me , have you made your mind up to take the oath i requested of you ? you have said puritans have but one word .: 76.97
<S> the air , the fresh , free air is so good ; besides , and rochefort drew a deep breath as he spoke , i am going into the country to make a tour . stop , cried d artagnan ; i , too , am going . and if i may without impertinence ask where are you going ? to seek my friends . what friends ? those that you asked about yesterday . athos , porthos and aramis you are looking for them ? yes . on honor ? what , then , is there surprising in that ? nothing .: 85.14
<S> and so the good la ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his prisoner .: 94.70
<S> emmanuel tried to comfort the women , but his eloquence faltered .: 203.01
<S> m. cavalcanti , his father , had been seen in paris , and it was expected that he would re appear to claim the illustrious outcast .: 47.62
<S> albert saw all these preparations and understood them , and exclaiming , my mother ! he threw his arms around her neck .: 64.02
<S> a nobleman retired from service , is he not ? yes . and who had a lackey named grimaud ? persisted planchet , who had prudently considered that he couldn t have too much information .: 114.41
<S> cowardly court !: 466.13
<S> it begins to develop itself , said d artagnan .: 36.61
<S> the latter , to make a short cut , had appeared on a <UNK> .: 82.83
<S> suspicion instantly seized me .: 349.61
<S> or rather , sir , said aramis , with his peculiar <UNK> politeness , the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom ; for if the comte de la fere and i are not mistaken , we saw you in the company of a third gentleman . chatillon and flamarens started .: 54.99
<S> possibly , said danglars ; was not this murdered man an old galley slave ? <UNK> yes , replied the count ; a felon named caderousse . danglars turned slightly pale ; andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing room .: 134.40
<S> all has gone according to my wishes .: 82.35
<S> save me !: 26.39
<S> this evening s adventure will serve for my excuse .: 108.03
<S> i have concentrated here at <UNK> camp all the resources heaven has left me , and i write to you in haste from thence .: 162.30
<S> sir , you will perhaps think that i am in a great hurry to leave you when i have only just arrived , but have you only two days of leave , raoul ? on the contrary , sir , i have ten ; nor is it to the camp i wish to go . where , then ? said athos , smiling , if it be not a secret .: 38.67
<S> by heaven !: 24.68
<S> she was still exceedingly handsome .: 67.86
<S> you had nothing left ? oh , yes , my friend ; there was still that diamond left which <UNK> on your finger , and which i had observed yesterday . this diamond ! said d artagnan , placing his hand eagerly on his ring .: 45.21
<S> we shall soon see , said porthos , in his tranquil way .: 32.34
<S> are you not going to put up at the arms of england ? yes , sir . are you not charged with a mission from his eminence , cardinal mazarin ? yes , sir . in that case , i am the man you have to do with .: 24.75
<S> why not ? said the musketeer .: 16.08
<S> two hours after he again landed at pianosa , where he was assured that red partridges <UNK> .: 260.97
<S> i have already answered that question in the affirmative ; but that command must come from the queen herself . yes !: 77.68
<S> then i saw that they took me for the assassin .: 35.23
<S> so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison , that their noise did not , in general , awake him ; but whether abstinence had <UNK> his faculties , or whether the noise was really louder than usual , edmond raised his head and listened .: 172.83
<S> bonacieux , addressing this epithet to her husband .: 64.65
<S> i shall pass all my life , thought d artagnan , in seeking for a man who is really contented with his lot . whilst making this reflection , chance seemed , as it were , to give him the lie direct .: 101.52
<S> suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense , and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him ; at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee .: 90.25
<S> this was julie , who had become , as the clerk of the house of thomson french had predicted , madame emmanuel herbault .: 55.65
<S> yes , said monte cristo you were a major ; that is the title the french give to the post which you filled in italy . very good , said the major , i do not demand more , you understand your visit here today is not of your own suggestion , is it ? said monte cristo .: 59.24
<S> sir , said mazarin to him an emeute is spoken of in paris .: 81.04
<S> section 2 .: 36.23
<S> i will say and do nothing until i am convinced that he has quite abandoned me , and then andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever .: 66.60
<S> write , my lord , he said .: 14.89
<S> the man who had followed danglars sat down on a bench .: 27.44
<S> we will arrange the matter rather better .: 185.41
<S> tis not civil war that <UNK> us .: 362.39
<S> there can be no doubt about it , thought he ; it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom .: 50.46
<S> fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant , who , in his thirty sixth year at the opening of this history , was now in his <UNK> ; his hair had turned white , time and sorrow had <UNK> deep <UNK> on his brow , and his look , once so firm and penetrating , was now irresolute and wandering , as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person .: 188.57
<S> there is myself , replied milady .: 29.19
<S> the aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory , which in spite of us will arouse them at times ; this thread , like that of <UNK> , when once <UNK> will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought , in which one loses one s self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection .: 317.23
<S> what has she written to me ? said buckingham , feebly , streaming with blood , and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved , what has she written to me ?: 79.01
<S> she will be the sooner with her mother .: 48.35
<S> athos , who had pocketed his share of the diamond , seldom quit the parpaillot .: 82.62
<S> as for the ladies , it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions , they thought they did not need them for themselves , as they were beautiful enough without them .: 63.27
<S> euge nie , apparently calm , although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual , went out in her turn .: 81.46
<S> athos pinched aramis s hand .: 77.06
<S> at ten minutes past five albert entered <UNK> .: 132.69
<S> the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken , was no other than the celebrated cabanis , and he predicted a similar end for me . <UNK> the physician may be mistaken ! exclaimed dante s .: 215.56
<S> let her , then , exhaust her vengeance on me alone ! my dear friend , of what consequence is it if she kills me ? said athos .: 54.01
<S> mordaunt !: 65.80
<S> milady had sunk into a chair , with her hands extended , as if to conjure this terrible apparition .: 41.17
<S> if it were one of your friends you would hesitate , then ? cried milady ; and a threatening glance darted from her eyes .: 33.83
<S> the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest .: 23.22
<S> having escaped these dangers , they returned by the main road to boulogne , at abbeville , and followed it step by step , examining every track .: 216.54
<S> i am afraid that remaining at blois would be dangerous to his youthful mind .: 113.36
<S> the slave of the count of monte cristo !: 17.46
<S> it is true , between ourselves , that m. de morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the luxembourg , a general renowned for theory , but a most <UNK> amateur of art .: 135.31
<S> what ails you , my dearest father ?: 32.02
<S> if the poor abbe had not been in such a hurry , he might have had his <UNK> . pooh , pooh ; said the doctor , with the <UNK> usual in persons of his profession ; he is a churchman .: 87.50
<S> you think , then , that you can help me more <UNK> than your brothers ? said gondy .: 38.47
<S> you will get me out if they put me there , said d artagnan .: 23.04
<S> and what effect did this discourse produce ? anxiously inquired albert .: 544.18
<S> mr .: 92.47
<S> well , i tell you that i come to you from the cardinal . this speech was heard by porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year <UNK> and related to the true cardinal .: 58.11
<S> grimaud has relieved mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door . well , don t be inactive . inactive , my dear fellow !: 101.64
<S> in order to make one s way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves , it was necessary to be an officer , a great noble , or a pretty woman .: 91.92
<S> did you come here , sir , to see the telegraph ? he said .: 20.51
<S> at this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants , who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper , the serenity of the weather continuing to increase .: 75.16
<S> this cost me , on your account and mine , 100,000 francs .: 67.27
<S> and in exchange for the sacrifice that you make , gentlemen , i promise not to reward you , i believe that word would offend you but to love you as a sister , to prefer you , next to my husband and my children , to every one .: 90.44
<S> i do not know you . read this letter , he said , handing it to her .: 27.22
<S> but in his present condition he will promise anything , and take his chance of keeping it afterwards . i will do more than i promise , said dante s .: 62.64
<S> if you do not want me at leghorn , you can leave me there , and i will pay you out of the first wages i get , for my food and the clothes you lend me . ah , said the captain , we can agree very well , if you are reasonable . give me what you give the others , and it will be all right , returned dante s .: 38.52
<S> if they kill you , english justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble .: 126.24
<S> in whom can i trust ? place confidence in me , madame ; do me that honor , my queen , and i will find a messenger . but i must write . oh , yes ; that is indispensable .: 54.16
<S> among these thousands moved , in bands <UNK> from one hundred to two hundred , pale and haggard men , clothed in rags , who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words : behold the misery of the people ! wherever these men passed , <UNK> cries were heard ; and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions .: 191.90
<S> then , <UNK> the young girl on the head , he continued , hayde e is very courageous , and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes . because , my lord , said hayde e eagerly , my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness . albert looked at her with curiosity , for she had not yet related what he most desired to know , how she had become the slave of the count .: 67.45
<S> no one at villefort s doubted that a duel would ensue from it .: 79.41
<S> at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so ; and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor ; but the latter <UNK> imagined that dante s wished to conspire or attempt an escape , and refused his request .: 107.04
<S> the two brigands looked at each other for a moment the one with a smile of <UNK> on his lips , the other with the pallor of death on his brow .: 43.83
<S> i can pass as one of the sailors <UNK> last night .: 130.60
<S> a sorrowful smile passed over his face ; he asked himself what had become of merce de s , who must believe him dead .: 30.00
<S> this <UNK> of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of m. baptistin .: 316.86
<S> this solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure .: 254.23
<S> you may retire , said milady .: 17.70
<S> my cousin knows nobody but bazin , and places confidence in nobody but him ; any other person would fail .: 225.53
<S> contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by u.s. federal laws and your state s laws .: 14.07
<S> i will run , then , till my legs no longer serve , till my heart bursts in my bosom but i will arrive before they do . mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks , about a quarter of a league distant .: 135.33
<S> do you authorize mademoiselle valentine to intrust herself to my honor ? no . do you prefer i should seek m. d e pinay ? no . whence then will come the help we need from chance ? resumed morrel .: 103.61
<S> while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror , and villefort , with his head hidden in the bedclothes , saw nothing around him , d avrigny approached the window , that he might the better examine the contents of the glass , and dipping the tip of his finger in , tasted it .: 72.29
<S> let it come , said athos .: 12.26
<S> now , by way of having a resting place during his excursions , avoiding the wretched cookery which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months , while you have <UNK> resisted its effects for as many years , and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber , monte cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him ; but , to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace , and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital , he has wisely enough purchased the island , and taken its name .: 252.35
<S> what would you do , tell me , if your sister listened to such a proposition ? mademoiselle , replied morrel with a bitter smile , i am selfish you have already said so and as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation , but of what i intend doing myself .: 57.01
<S> take the diamond , then , and sell it ; it is worth fifty thousand francs , and i repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness . <UNK> oh , sir , said caderousse , putting out one hand timidly , and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow , oh , sir , do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man . i know what happiness and what despair are , and i never make a jest of such feelings .: 60.88
<S> it was midnight .: 36.23
<S> the remains of poor rene e were already deposited there , and now , after ten years of separation , her father and mother were to be reunited with her .: 57.19
<S> to me , to you , to us !: 44.15
<S> d artagnan shrugged his shoulders , made a sign to his escort and started .: 19.85
<S> what can i say more ? asked monte cristo .: 10.55
<S> ah , may you be a true prophet ! said d artagnan , laughing .: 30.76
<S> any other person would , perhaps , have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise ; but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister , although he saw that dandre was irrevocably lost .: 117.75
<S> what can they have said ? and she again tried to think what it could be .: 34.64
<S> into the service the king s service ? mousqueton trembled ; even his fat , smooth cheeks shook as he spoke , and he looked at d artagnan with an air of reproach ; he staggered , and his voice was almost choked .: 69.69
<S> i should dread some disagreeable encounter if i were to go home . be easy .: 111.69
<S> for one day listen , my son one day , if you do so , they will <UNK> you to destruction , head and crown , too , and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience , as i die .: 63.43
<S> then , in addition to these concealed or public , secret or open wars , there were robbers , mendicants , huguenots , wolves , and scoundrels , who made war upon everybody .: 187.20
<S> a ray of joy passed across m. de boville s countenance , yet he made an effort at self control , and said : sir , i ought to tell you that , in all probability , you will not realize six per cent of this sum . that s no affair of mine , replied the englishman , that is the affair of the house of thomson french , in whose name i act .: 33.31
<S> the king s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity ; he looked upon her less severely , and , bowing to her , said slowly : farewell , madame , farewell ! that farewell struck madame de villefort like the executioner s knife .: 71.79
<S> why ? what do you mean by that question ? i mean that if there were , it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these .: 45.77
<S> planchet , whom he had sent home two hours before from the ho tel de ville , telling him to sit up for him , opened the door for him .: 25.93
<S> i suppose you mean continued d artagnan .: 41.08
<S> albert had himself presided at the arrangement , or , rather , the <UNK> <UNK> , which , after coffee , the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths , and <UNK> in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling .: 344.00
<S> limited warranty , disclaimer of damages except for the right of replacement or refund described in paragraph 1.f.3 , the project gutenberg literary archive foundation , the owner of the project gutenberg trademark , and any other party distributing a project gutenberg electronic work under this agreement , disclaim all liability to you for damages , costs and expenses , including legal fees .: 15.45
<S> you will enter by the rue <UNK> sainte catherine ; under the second lamp on the right you will find your adversary .: 177.98
<S> the lieutenant s entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawing room ; but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention , but began to arrange , with so much <UNK> , nicety and gayety , his straw bed , that the mouths of all these poor creatures , who could not go to sleep , began to water .: 96.64
<S> the <UNK> of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers , or a change of manners , or an alteration of language .: 180.05
<S> a child <UNK> a fugitive ; perhaps , on perceiving it was still alive , he had thrown it into the river . impossible ! cried madame danglars : a man may murder another out of revenge , but he would not deliberately drown a child . perhaps , continued villefort , he had put it in the foundling hospital . oh , yes , yes , cried the baroness ; my child is there ! i ran to the hospital , and learned that the same night the night of the 20th of september a child had been brought there , wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin , purposely torn in half .: 100.01
<S> then , after dinner , on the pretext of business , he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living ; and the father and son , previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his 48,000 francs and the other 50,000 livres <UNK> , were so full of <UNK> that they would have shaken hands even with the banker s servants , so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon .: 147.03
<S> you ve killed him , i think . no , wounded his horse only . what would you have , my dear fellow ?: 60.52
<S> do you know , sir , that you are asking me very strange questions , and that i am very foolish to answer them ? reply to them , my lord , said felton ; the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe . buckingham reflected that the young man , coming from lord de winter , undoubtedly spoke in his name , and softened .: 61.65
<S> the siege once over , we shall be able to make a tour in that direction . and that will not be long , it is to be hoped , said porthos ; for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the rochellais were reduced to the leather of their shoes .: 64.94
<S> yes , and at the same time making a hole in the wall . the king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to heaven ; then leaping down from his bed he went to the window , and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside , but in vain .: 44.22
<S> i tell you the queen does not love me ; i tell you she loves another ; i tell you she loves that infamous buckingham !: 44.22
<S> as for m. de tre ville , when the eyes of the king fell upon him , he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes ; after which his majesty , grumbling , entered his apartment .: 43.84
<S> fortunately , you have the sapphire . the jewel is yours , my dear athos !: 47.69
<S> adieu , raoul , said the count ; adieu , my dearest boy ! adieu , sir , adieu , my beloved protector . athos waved his hand he dared not trust himself to speak : and raoul went away , his head uncovered .: 53.86
<S> conclusion on the sixth of the following month the king , in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to la rochelle , left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of buckingham s assassination .: 102.35
<S> are you then making a thesis ? without doubt , replied the jesuit .: 33.01
<S> he found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery , admiring himself before a glass .: 136.33
<S> but how did this horse come into your hands , mousqueton ? pray , said the lackey , say nothing about it , monsieur ; it is a frightful trick of the husband of our duchess ! how is that , mousqueton ? why , we are looked upon with a rather favorable eye by a lady of quality , the duchesse de but , your pardon ; my master has commanded me to be discreet .: 86.42
<S> and now , raoul , said he , you are launched ; you have dukes for friends , a marshal of france for godfather , a prince of the blood as commander , and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens ; it is not so bad for a novice . oh sir , said raoul , suddenly , you recall something , which , in my haste to relate my exploits , i had forgotten ; it is that there was with her majesty the queen of england , a gentleman who , when i pronounced your name , uttered a cry of surprise and joy ; he said he was a friend of yours , asked your address , and is coming to see you . what is his name ? i did not venture to ask , sir ; he spoke elegantly , although i thought from his accent he was an englishman . ah ! said athos , leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be .: 57.85
<S> the last alternative seemed the most prudent , so he waited until twelve o clock .: 154.99
<S> place this man in the care of his guards again , and let him wait till i send for him . no , monseigneur , no , it is not he ! cried bonacieux ; no , i was deceived .: 33.63
<S> speak !: 35.77
<S> milady had had time , during the whole day , to trace her plan of conduct .: 73.80
<S> hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs e lyse es , and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my departure . maximilian hung his head , and obeyed with childlike reverence .: 66.06
<S> if you will permit me , i shall be happy to show you my picture gallery , composed entirely of works by the ancient masters warranted as such .: 136.95
<S> oh , you are so kind , and i am so grateful ! how can i avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so amiable ?: 61.73
<S> is it you ? said he ; i am here . is your jailer gone ? yes , said dante s ; he will not return until the evening ; so that we have twelve hours before us . i can work , then ? said the voice .: 30.75
<S> thank you , thank you , murmured she .: 21.94
<S> you see , said she , when the lackey had gone out , everything is ready .: 23.23
<S> he placed the young girl again on the chair , her lips were scarcely discernible , they were so pale and white , as well as her whole face , and remained motionless , looking at noirtier , who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did .: 55.91
<S> when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed , lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another .: 115.70
<S> you see , said dante s , quitting the helm , i shall be of some use to you , at least during the voyage .: 33.86
<S> you will kill yourself , cried planchet .: 22.27
<S> in fact , at half past eight in the evening the grand salon , the gallery adjoining , and the three other drawing rooms on the same floor , were filled with a perfumed crowd , who <UNK> but little in the event , but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen .: 111.44
<S> i do not know , replied dante s .: 7.07
<S> he was an honest man , said d artagnan .: 10.85
<S> let us return to m. franz d e pinay .: 8.46
<S> thank you , sir , thank you ! this is how you have lived during the last four nights , valentine , said the count .: 25.56
<S> for the poison which she <UNK> there is no antidote . yes , yes !: 161.03
<S> imagine a man who has <UNK> business with me for i don t know how long , to the amount of 800,000 or 900,000 francs during the year .: 87.36
<S> certainly , monsieur , speak , he said , softening his stern , <UNK> tones , as if he were speaking to a woman .: 48.46
<S> did we not swear friendship ?: 202.80
<S> the battle of charenton .: 47.71
<S> you now understand , hayde e , said the count , that from this moment you are absolutely free ; that here you exercise unlimited sway , and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country , as it may suit your inclination .: 107.61
<S> it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement .: 27.24
<S> my dear sir , said monte cristo , i understand your emotion ; you must have time to recover yourself .: 19.72
<S> he consented .: 54.71
<S> hem , thought monte cristo , he begins to conceal his losses ; a month since he boasted of them . then aloud , oh , madame , m. danglars is so skilful , he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere . i see that you participate in a prevalent error , said madame danglars .: 129.79
<S> here and there a dog <UNK> behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of <UNK> , from which retreat her eyes would shine like <UNK> .: 459.15
<S> monsieur d artagnan , he said , you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and bring back here the person it concerns .: 39.24
<S> monsieur , replied the count , with a <UNK> air , i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother , for they say that the sentiment of <UNK> is the most holy of all ; and the good fortune which occurred to me , monsieur , might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which , in its discharge , <UNK> an undoubtedly great honor ; for i am aware that m. de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now <UNK> on me , a favor which , however estimable , is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness . villefort , astonished at this reply , which he by no means expected , started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears , and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman .: 106.48
<S> i swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers ; but i conjure you do not abandon me .: 74.25
<S> his interlocutor , whose head appeared through the carriage window , was a woman of from twenty to two and twenty years .: 56.44
<S> he was softened .: 48.54
<S> they might not be satisfied , and ah , ha , thought danglars , this is not so much like paris , except that i shall probably be <UNK> !: 70.00
<S> from that moment she watched all his actions , all his words , from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh .: 96.91
<S> i do not see what you have in your hand , said selim .: 20.25
<S> meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room ; and after asking bernouin , who stood at the door , whether anything had occurred during his absence , and being answered in the negative , he desired that he might be left alone .: 42.57
<S> but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal , so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england , had not succeeded in arresting him on the road .: 94.68
<S> but , at all events , i gave him absolution in articulo mortis .: 53.98
<S> the young girl s lover was in cucumetto s troop ; his name was carlini .: 65.86
<S> what do you say to this , mother ? and albert took out of a little pocket book with golden clasps , a remnant of his old fancies , or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door , albert took out of this pocket book a note of 1,000 francs .: 77.85
<S> it is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it .: 93.38
<S> before an hour has passed you will be discovered , arrested , obliged to kill me , which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like you . he is right , thought athos .: 79.93
<S> a propos , add one thing what ? i saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden .: 481.10
<S> stop , let me show you the way . it is not worthwhile . yes , it is . why ? because there is a little secret , a precaution i thought it desirable to take , one of <UNK> <UNK> s locks , <UNK> and improved by gaspard caderousse ; i will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist . thank you , said andrea ; i will let you know a week beforehand . they parted .: 127.28
<S> i will begin again , then : order to conduct to the person named charlotte backson , branded by the justice of the kingdom of france , but liberated after chastisement .: 127.45
<S> the center of the most animated group was a musketeer of great height and haughty countenance , dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract general attention .: 150.46
<S> baron danglars . one , two , three , four , five , said monte cristo ; five millions why what a cr sus you are ! this is how i transact business , said danglars .: 123.71
<S> you call yourself , in paris , the count of monte cristo ; in italy , sinbad the sailor ; in malta , i forget what .: 45.34
<S> i beg your excellency s pardon , interposed the steward in a deprecating manner , for venturing to observe that it is already two o clock . i am perfectly aware of that fact , answered monte cristo calmly .: 48.62
<S> after the battle of <UNK> , when the greek government was <UNK> , he asked of king otho a mining grant for that district , which was given him .: 266.03
<S> lord de winter came toward five o clock in the evening .: 12.57
<S> a considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord .: 138.15
<S> extremely , replied he ; she looked so pale this morning , i scarcely knew her . these apparently simple words pierced morrel to the heart .: 184.06
<S> alas !: 11.34
<S> one of my brothers is about to die and i come to prepare him . bear with him , whispered aramis ; it is doubtless some spy . after my reverend lord bishop , said the king to the man , i shall hear you with pleasure , sir . the man retired , but not before examining the supposed juxon with an attention which did not escape the king .: 86.54
<S> just ask yourself , my good fellow , whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of ? but , said franz , the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel ? why , really the thing seems to me simple enough .: 147.33
<S> oh , count , i shall sleep calmly , <UNK> in the arms of death . morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder .: 46.96
<S> how had he discovered her arrival , and caused her to be seized ?: 71.67
<S> a man has carried off your mistress , a man has seduced your wife , a man has dishonored your daughter ; he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures , an existence of misery and infamy ; and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head , or pass a sword through the breast , of that man who has planted madness in your brain , and despair in your heart .: 98.43
<S> madame de saint me ran wished her daughter should be married there .: 38.30
<S> it is not i who strike m. de morcerf ; it is providence which punishes him . and why do you represent providence ? cried merce de s .: 44.62
<S> the house of the duke of bracciano is one of the most delightful in rome , the duchess , one of the last <UNK> of the <UNK> , does its honors with the most consummate grace , and thus their fe tes have a european celebrity .: 122.35
<S> bonacieux expected to see milady , but she did not return .: 32.35
<S> the fowl was tender , the wine old , the fire clear and sparkling , and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened .: 176.17
<S> is it really your intention to make me captain of the pharaon ? if i were sole owner we d shake hands on it now , my dear dante s , and call it settled ; but i have a partner , and you know the italian proverb <UNK> ha <UNK> ha <UNK> he who has a partner has a master . but the thing is at least half done , as you have one out of two votes .: 192.93
<S> with monsieur . monsieur has returned , then ? of course , naively replied the servant .: 83.46
<S> as to what you say about not seeing you again , i believe not a word of it ; with such a heart as yours and such a sword one passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times , <UNK> and <UNK> .: 98.64
<S> oh , yes ; certainly a speedy , violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these <UNK> enemies , who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance .: 167.57
<S> you understand , it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash box .: 80.87
<S> all the ladies rose , and there was a profound silence .: 28.53
<S> he drew back a step , and hung down his head , without , however , ceasing to look at her , as if , fascinated by this strange creature , he could not detach his eyes from her eyes .: 30.65
<S> stop !: 27.26
<S> this is the second time that monsieur d artagnan has been in england .: 14.49
<S> we shall both get into trouble .: 101.72
<S> you have sent for me , sir , said athos to m. de tre ville , in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice , you have sent for me , as my comrades inform me , and i have hastened to receive your orders .: 34.83
<S> at the end of a hundred paces , the ground began to decline , and he could only see the mast of the sloop .: 22.13
<S> speak , command , i will obey . morrel , who had already gone some few steps away , again returned , and pale with joy extended both hands towards valentine through the opening .: 69.83
<S> villefort rose , and ran towards his mother in law , for it was she .: 31.96
<S> the reader <UNK> herself instantly .: 362.13
<S> you will find it in the water you drink from the spring , in the fruit you pluck from the tree . but did you not say that my kind grandfather s precaution had <UNK> the poison ? yes , but not against a strong dose ; the poison will be changed , and the quantity increased . he took the glass and raised it to his lips .: 94.63
<S> and you assisted and took part in this great battle , bragelonne ! cried the former musketeer .: 138.29
<S> tell me truly , maximilian , whether in former days , when our fathers dwelt at marseilles , there was ever any misunderstanding between them ? not that i am aware of , replied the young man , unless , indeed , any ill feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties your father was , as you know , a zealous partisan of the bourbons , while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor ; there could not possibly be any other difference between them .: 123.91
<S> another flash illuminated all around them .: 232.83
<S> milady was there , as it were , where you sit . athos changed color .: 129.70
<S> aramis , who was constantly at work at his poem , shut himself up in athos s closet , and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing swords .: 59.25
<S> well , well ! said he , you are brave young men , proud in daylight , faithful in darkness .: 61.63
<S> mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance .: 323.55
<S> ah , madame , cried debray , what is the matter with you ?: 11.71
<S> i know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair , because you are brave , and i am brave also .: 48.06
<S> their horses flew , and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis .: 54.15
<S> besides , a signal made half a league out at sea , and to which la jeune ame lie replied by a similar signal , indicated that the moment for business had come .: 105.34
<S> athos , still within the inclosure of the window , watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips .: 35.60
<S> he again took in his strong arms the little girl , whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder , and placed her gently in the carriage ; then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a first rate esquire , after bowing to athos and d artagnan , he went off close by the door of the carriage , on somebody inside of which his eyes were riveted .: 87.37
<S> by reading or using any part of this project gutenberg electronic work , you indicate that you have read , understand , agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property trademark copyright agreement .: 117.08
<S> besides , added he , lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal , let us give them apparent security ; that is policy . this policy of louis xiii .: 91.07
<S> that s well .: 16.02
<S> as the door was closed rochefort cast a glance toward mazarin , which was answered by one , equally furtive , from the minister .: 110.68
<S> spare me , then , i beseech you .: 20.14
<S> the discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost miraculous .: 323.89
<S> lord winter , you are not the king ; you are my uncle . at the same moment mordaunt , for it was he , leveled his pistol at winter ; it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier , who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of athos , murmuring : he is avenged ! think of my mother ! shouted mordaunt , as his horse plunged and darted off at full gallop .: 73.04
<S> i have been wrong ; i see it .: 26.38
<S> i shall be back here by the first of march , and on the second i give my real marriage feast . this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree , that the elder dante s , who , at the commencement of the repast , had commented upon the silence that prevailed , now found it difficult , amid the general din of voices , to obtain a moment s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom .: 127.47
<S> he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer , although the latter was , if possible , more taciturn than the old one ; but still , to speak to a man , even though mute , was something .: 90.89
<S> and for whom for some grisette , some chambermaid with whom i have <UNK> in some garrison ?: 320.20
<S> he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie ; there the aspect changed ; here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop ; their doors seemed closed like their shutters , but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men , who seemed fearful of showing what they carried , to enter , closing immediately .: 145.78
<S> they talk of making him an ambassador . <UNK> and what are his claims to the <UNK> ? he has composed two or three <UNK> <UNK> , written four or five articles in the <UNK> cle , and voted five or six years on the ministerial side . bravo , viscount , said monte cristo , smiling ; you are a delightful cicerone .: 182.58
<S> of how much does he rob you every year ? on my word , replied the count , not more than another .: 54.65
<S> dante s folded his hands , raised his eyes to heaven , and prayed fervently .: 34.97
<S> oh , it is impossible , said he , i must be dreaming !: 18.68
<S> what is it ? said she , starting at madame danglars touch as she would have done from an electric shock .: 54.66
<S> just so .: 79.72
<S> the builder cheerfully undertook the commission , and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day , dante s furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed .: 237.23
<S> when i like . caderousse was thoughtful for a moment .: 55.69
<S> porthos bowed .: 27.79
<S> in those times <UNK> were common , and few days passed without some city or other <UNK> in its archives an event of this kind .: 334.44
<S> retire within , bertuccio , and <UNK> your mind .: 273.73
<S> the marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him .: 32.63
<S> the rendezvous d artagnan ran home immediately , and although it was three o clock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of paris to traverse , he met with no misadventure .: 52.36
<S> milady rushed to the door and opened it .: 13.71
<S> let me look at you ! and while saying these words , she absolutely devoured her by her looks .: 100.40
<S> as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal , kitty knew nothing about it ; but this time d artagnan was better informed than she was .: 75.21
<S> i shall work , doctor when i work i forget everything . and , indeed , no sooner had the doctor left the room , than he was again absorbed in work .: 84.08
<S> albert , however , hoped to indemnify himself for all these <UNK> and <UNK> during the carnival , knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated , rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives , and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation .: 225.61
<S> for a long time a gun had been the young man s greatest ambition .: 35.50
<S> the prisoner is there , replied vampa , pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard , and i will go myself and tell him he is free . the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as albert s prison , and franz and the count followed him .: 45.65
<S> that will serve us for a relay , said athos .: 44.61
<S> bonacieux , pardon me for interrupting you ; but what do you advise me to do ?: 29.82
<S> there is the true reason !: 27.43
<S> in the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to melun , since rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure .: 182.79
<S> morrel now emerged from his hiding place , where he had remained quite unperceived , so great had been the general confusion .: 87.49
<S> during this time , in the kiosk at my father s feet , were seated twenty palikares , concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats .: 106.80
<S> then , rushing hastily out of the apartment , he ran upstairs , expecting to find his father in his study , but he rapped there in vain .: 55.48
<S> the past the count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left merce de s , probably never to behold her again .: 56.82
<S> blaisois returned disconsolate to the hotel of the grand roi charlemagne and when athos inquired if his commission was executed , he related his adventure .: 163.16
<S> sheathe , then , if you please , and follow us . monsieur , said aramis , parodying jussac , it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves ; but unfortunately the thing is impossible monsieur de tre ville has forbidden it .: 71.61
<S> but vampa raised his head proudly ; as to teresa , her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold .: 135.43
<S> the conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game , yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him .: 234.39
<S> to wait at monte cristo for the purpose of watching like a <UNK> over the almost <UNK> riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the <UNK> of his heart , which <UNK> to return to dwell among mankind , and to assume the rank , power , and influence which are always accorded to wealth that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man .: 252.35
<S> gentlemen , said he , if monsieur d artagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours , i shall be satisfied with your promise to convey monsieur d artagnan to the quarters of monseigneur the cardinal . you have my word , monsieur , and here is my sword . this suits me the better , said rochefort , as i wish to continue my journey . if it is for the purpose of <UNK> milady , said athos , coolly , it is useless ; you will not find her . what has become of her , then ? asked rochefort , eagerly .: 36.17
<S> debray stretched himself upon a large couch , and madame danglars passed into her dressing room with mademoiselle corne lie .: 61.08
<S> my dear albert , one word , for i must give poor lucien a respite .: 141.93
<S> it was noon , and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of hayde e , as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and <UNK> joy , but required a <UNK> succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness , in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations .: 212.33
<S> you lie , said the abbe busoni , with a tone of irresistible authority .: 42.91
<S> but it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our place cry , down with mazarin ! i will : down with mazarin in french , in good french , my lord , take care of your accent ; they killed six thousand <UNK> in sicily because they pronounced italian badly .: 213.89
<S> she worries me everywhere , said d artagnan .: 71.42
<S> from that moment i have neither seen nor heard anything . d artagnan , entirely overcome by this terrible story , remained motionless and mute , while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his heart .: 54.24
<S> and to that friend i say , during the three quarters of an hour that the struggle continued , i watched the convulsions and the death of madame de saint me ran , and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison , but i could also specify the poison . can it be possible ? the symptoms are marked , do you see ? sleep broken by nervous <UNK> , excitation of the brain , torpor of the nerve <UNK> .: 154.30
<S> m. d avrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison ; and you , honest man , have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret .: 168.15
<S> yes , your majesty ! cried the duke .: 10.73
<S> the table and chair had nothing , the pail had once possessed a handle , but that had been removed .: 142.66
<S> if these five men give themselves up we gag them ; if they resist , we kill them .: 145.12
<S> sinbad the sailor . humph , said the major ; very good .: 57.18
<S> he grew more pale every minute , and they were obliged to support him on his horse .: 46.89
<S> then we are once more reunited ? said andrea .: 68.08
<S> come back as ambassador , come back as minister , come back surrounded with guards who will defend you , with servants who will watch over you , and then i shall no longer fear for your days , and i shall be happy in seeing you . oh , is this true what you say ? yes . oh , then , some pledge of your indulgence , some object which came from you , and may remind me that i have not been dreaming ; something you have worn , and that i may wear in my turn a ring , a necklace , a chain . will you depart will you depart , if i give you that you demand ? yes . this very instant ? yes . you will leave france , you will return to england ? i will , i swear to you . wait , then , wait . anne of austria re entered her apartment , and came out again almost immediately , holding a rosewood casket in her hand , with her cipher encrusted with gold .: 62.94
<S> the star of day , pale but nevertheless still splendid , was setting in the horizon , <UNK> at once the heavens and the sea with bands of fire , and casting upon the towers and the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration .: 169.08
<S> the bastion saint gervais chapter <UNK> .: 56.13
<S> he reflected , smiled , and replied to me by a sicilian proverb , which i believe is also a french proverb , my son , the world was not made in a day but in seven .: 116.41
<S> is it not a joke ? said danglars .: 15.98
<S> i assure you i intend to play the devil s game to night . d artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets .: 74.04
<S> everything in this charming retreat , from the <UNK> of the birds to the smile of the mistress , breathed tranquillity and repose .: 197.73
<S> is it because my opinions differ from yours ? nothing of the kind , sir , replied danglars : if such had been the case , i only should have been to blame , inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement .: 60.88
<S> a quarter of an hour afterwards the door of valentine s room opened , and monte cristo reappeared .: 14.82
<S> i confess i began to be very uneasy on your account . but your host <UNK> very well toward you , as it appears , my dear porthos , said d artagnan , directing the sick man s attention to the full stewpans and the empty bottles .: 58.46
<S> but for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves , how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain !: 243.31
<S> but no , i found nothing , though i had made a hole twice as large as the first .: 55.02
<S> but as there were all kinds of people about , who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court , he whispered in his friend s ear .: 49.15
<S> to do with you , my lord ? inquired aramis .: 14.15
<S> the englishmen were all men of rank ; consequently the odd names of their adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise , but of annoyance .: 134.88
<S> however , if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg work in a format other than plain <UNK> <UNK> or other format used in the official <UNK> posted on the official project gutenberg website www.gutenberg.org , you must , at no additional cost , fee or expense to the user , provide a copy , a means of <UNK> a copy , or a means of obtaining a copy upon request , of the work in its original plain <UNK> <UNK> or other form .: 262.91
<S> now , if you please , remove your bandage . the general tore the handkerchief from his eyes .: 37.24
<S> her beauty and high bearing surprised him , and when she inquired what had become of her lover , it seemed to him that she was the judge , and he the accused .: 56.11
<S> so , so , said he , in a hoarse and choking voice , to danglars , this , then , i suppose , is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday ?: 52.18
<S> the commissary then , instead of continuing to interrogate him , made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters .: 163.99
<S> why do you like that best ? because then i have no responsibility .: 50.31
<S> a despairing cry escaped the pale lips of merce de s ; the old man sank into a chair .: 28.35
<S> a bright spot burned in either cheek , her respiration was short and difficult , and her pulse beat with feverish excitement .: 155.86
<S> villefort , while turning <UNK> on the cushions , felt something press against him .: 165.76
<S> the day before yesterday was a fish day , and they had nothing but meat . what , said athos , no fish at a seaport ? they say , said aramis , resuming his pious reading , that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea . but that is not quite what i mean to ask you , aramis , replied athos .: 89.78
<S> are people to be run against without warning ?: 223.15
<S> he will say , in that case , to the king that i am determined on war , and that this measure is my first act of hostility against france . the secretary bowed and retired .: 53.47
<S> my faith !: 16.94
<S> what the devil !: 8.64
<S> this philosophic reflection , thought he , will make a great sensation at m. de saint me ran s ; and he arranged mentally , while dante s awaited further questions , the <UNK> by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence .: 223.35
<S> after this he took from his cupboard the bank notes and gold he had put there , thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers , and the other into that of his waistcoat , hastily tied up a small bundle of linen , and rushing towards the door , disappeared in the darkness of the night .: 77.05
<S> so much the better .: 8.38
<S> madame morrel looked again through the keyhole , morrel was writing ; but madame morrel remarked , what her daughter had not observed , that her husband was writing on stamped paper .: 127.50
<S> therefore , in spite of all my protestations , if it be as i suspect , my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his eminence in horror . it , however , proved otherwise .: 96.33
<S> and you i ve only thrown the fellow down , but hark ! another shot of a carbine was heard .: 231.57
<S> in england the post was well served .: 87.55
<S> the following morning jacopo set sail for marseilles , with directions from dante s to join him at the island of monte cristo .: 51.17
<S> well , what good wind blows you hither at this hour ? said he ; have you come to sup with me ?: 73.01
<S> ah !: 7.24
<S> how they must be asking , where is the cardinal ? what has become of the minister ? where has the favorite gone ? how they must be looking for monseigneur in all corners !: 96.65
<S> what will you do with the letter , then ? asked porthos .: 11.68
<S> it is for me to give orders here , and not you . monsieur , replied dante s proudly , it was only to summon assistance for you . i want none ; it was a temporary indisposition .: 60.41
<S> as he alighted , he thought he saw his father s pale face behind the curtain of the count s bedroom .: 29.78
<S> you believe , and yet you leave me in the hands of mine enemies , of the enemy of england , of the enemy of god !: 44.10
<S> where were you born ? continued the president .: 33.48
<S> this assurance determined the two friends to accept it .: 136.95
<S> i am a great captain that i am !: 33.30
<S> he turned to brush away a tear , and then , summoning up all his firmness , drew his daughter toward him , recommending her to be pious and resigned .: 122.75
<S> it was her first , and on what an occasion !: 80.72
<S> this letter was from my brother .: 35.36
<S> on the contrary , one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly to morrow . comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the carriage , from which he made the people inside dismount , and brought them to the vehicle which had upset .: 104.81
<S> but in either case , what is to be done ? said the young man .: 19.24
<S> is he dead ?: 24.28
<S> take care my cries are not heard , for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison , and we be separated forever .: 70.04
<S> in a corner was the spanish companion , donna estafania , who had followed her from madrid .: 133.22
<S> i do not understand you . so much the better , i have a ray of hope left ; listen . i am all attention , said euge nie , looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her <UNK> gaze .: 54.56
<S> the island of tiboulen dante s , although stunned and almost suffocated , had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath , and as his right hand prepared as he was for every chance held his knife open , he rapidly ripped up the sack , extricated his arm , and then his body ; but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot , he felt it dragging him down still lower .: 97.22
<S> he laid every action of his life before the almighty , proposed <UNK> to accomplish , and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to god : forgive us our <UNK> as we forgive them that <UNK> against us . yet in spite of his earnest prayers , dante s remained a prisoner .: 310.95
<S> for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a <UNK> infected with the plague .: 180.63
<S> i know that by name at least . that is it precisely , signor <UNK> ; it is hashish the purest and most <UNK> hashish of alexandria , the hashish of <UNK> <UNK> , the celebrated maker , the only man , the man to whom there should be built a palace , inscribed with these words , a grateful world to the dealer in happiness . do you know , said franz , i have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies . judge for yourself , signor <UNK> judge , but do not confine yourself to one trial .: 184.96
<S> franz and albert made some difficulty , alleging their fear of depriving him of it ; but the count replied that , as he was going to the <UNK> theatre , the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it .: 100.31
<S> porthos , in order to make a greater display , had that evening borrowed planchet .: 119.38
<S> it is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style . i think , decidedly , observed aramis , gentlemen , that the son hasn t his mother s energy . what , my good fellow ! replied athos , wait awhile ; we have scarcely left him two hours ago he does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are .: 89.07
<S> bonacieux !: 45.73
<S> undoubtedly i know it , but it is a mystery . not to me , i hope ? no , not to you , so i am going to tell you where he is . porthos devoured d artagnan with wondering eyes .: 37.13
<S> d avrigny , unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion , turned away ; and villefort , without seeking any further explanation , and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn , extended his hand towards the young man .: 90.90
<S> and what does it amount to , after all ?: 51.59
<S> your doors are guarded , the <UNK> of your cellars are guarded , and i could say to you , as that good la ramee said to me of the duc de beaufort , you must be either bird or mouse to get out . he did get out , nevertheless . do you think of escaping in the same way ? i am a prisoner , then ? parbleu ! said mazarin , i have been proving it to you this last hour . and he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted .: 73.55
<S> i was obliged to sound a retreat toward the rue tiquetonne ; i was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this , where i have been concealed between two <UNK> .: 88.42
<S> so much the better .: 8.38
<S> well , for my part , said athos , i found aramis s spanish wine so good that i sent on a <UNK> of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the lackeys .: 78.70
<S> yes , your majesty , there is a title which i covet much , replied scarron .: 56.63
<S> in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been , in some sort , forced to give his hand to albert .: 37.99
<S> as for my disposition , that is , perhaps , somewhat too hasty ; but i have <UNK> to repress it .: 125.82
<S> but there is no need to know danger in order to fear it ; indeed , it may be observed , that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror .: 89.54
<S> you see , continued he , glancing toward the grate , where fragments of burnt paper <UNK> in the flames , the letter is destroyed ; you and i alone know of its existence ; should you , therefore , be questioned , deny all knowledge of it deny it boldly , and you are saved . be satisfied ; i will deny it . it was the only letter you had ? it was . swear it . i swear it . villefort rang .: 103.87
<S> from <UNK> to marseilles , seven francs . . 7 .: 563.04
<S> no , no ; i go , i depart !: 27.79
<S> immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun , and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice enemies .: 268.92
<S> is not the greatest thief in the world , monsieur the king s secretary le camus , who came to paris with twenty francs in his pocket and who now possesses ten millions ? the dog shook his head .: 58.93
<S> know , then , what i thought i had already told you , that in participation in this world s affairs , more especially in their moral aspects , the count of monte cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the east .: 63.30
<S> you who love , and are beloved ; you , who have faith and hope , oh , do not follow my example .: 73.42
<S> and as i hear everywhere that at the court they are ill disposed to him , i wish to warn him , that he may be on his guard . broussel heard the scream of the young <UNK> , and , enchanted with this excess of zeal , came down to the first floor , for he was , in truth , working in his room on the second .: 74.62
